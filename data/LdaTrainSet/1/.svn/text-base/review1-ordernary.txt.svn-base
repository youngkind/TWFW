I've had a pair of 240's for the last 8 years. About 2 years ago, I ran over the cable with my office chair, and basically ruined the headphones. I mended the cable, but they never really sounded right again.So, I got a pair of Shure E40's, and they've been quite good. Yesterday, I finally realized that the jack on the AKG's was broken, not the wire. So, I replaced the jack, and for the first time in about two years, am using the headphones again.The sound quality is leagues better than anything else I've used in the last two years. Better than the Shures, better than the Sennheisers I got through work. There's a huge amount of detail that I'd been missing with the other headphones. I'm not an audio professional, or even a hardcore audiophile, but I've been a musician since I was young, and have a good ear.For the price, I haven't heard anything that even comes close to these headphones. Just watch the cord.                    I must have gotten the deal of the century in April 08 as I picked these up for $79.95 from BSW through Amazon.  Currently the best price on Amazon is $125.  These headphones are still worth it at $125.I use these with a Ipod at work and wear them for 6+ hours a day.  I've come close to depleting the battery only a couple of times (it's a 30 GB gen 5.5 Ipod).  The bass and seperation sounds fantastic.  You can crank these up to full volume without distortion (though I don't play them that loud to save my hearing).  Most people in my department wear headphones and the most common comment when they put these on is "WOW".The long cord is good and bad.  It sometimes gets in the way, but not that big of a deal.The comfort is something.  They fit over the ears without pinching and as I stated above, they are worn for 6+ hours a day.These replace Sony MDR-D777LP headphones which I paid way too much for in a brick and mortar store.  These sound leaps and bounds better.  The Sony MDR-D777LP headphones only lasted about 9 months before breaking ( a very common occurance).                    Edit: 12/2012I no longer recommend these headphones, I feel the sound and build quality have suffered since the move to building them in China. They are still a decent buy, and I can't recommend another semi-open in this price range, but the closed offerings in the bracket are MUCH better options in my opinion. I'm talking about the usual suspects the MDR-7506 and ATH-M50 are my two favorites.----- Back to 2008 -----These are considered the studio standard in circumaural open back headphones for good reason. The sound reproduction is excellent, with clear bass and midrange and a very balanced profile through the entire frequency spectrum. It makes me angry at how much I've spent on speakers and studio monitors, these do a better job at a fraction of the price.They are circumaural they fit OVER your ears. I guess some people don't like that. I think they might change their mind if they tried these. If you're looking for a SUPRA-aural design look at the AKG K141I find them extremely comfortable. I have literally forgotten I was wearing them more than once. The suspension system adjusts automagically and is excellent. At first I felt a little unsure about the security of the hold, I've been using these mostly as monitors while recording guitar and bass parts, but they've made it through some pretty enthusiastic headbanging without getting dislodged. It also prevents almost all the banging and noise you normally hear when handling your headphones.The ear pads are soft and comfortable and have a nice synthetic cover which feels like glove leather and has just the right combination of grip and smoothness.They are semi-open. In this case it means that with no sound coming out of them they are basically aurally transparent but when they are on it takes a pretty loud sound outside to be noticeable. They are excellent at the job I use them for, monitoring a master track while laying down new parts, because you can hear yourself and the room sound pretty naturally and still have a high quality monitor with no bleed through to the mic'ed amps. If you are intending to use these for monitoring during vocal track recording you might want to consider a closed back design, these can be a little loud close up, The K271 is an excellent option with an ingenious auto-mute feature that work off the same magical suspension system.Other Cool Features:mini-xlr connector on cord - replace your mangled cord or make your own!fully rebuildable and modular - any component can be replaced if neccesaryGripes:It ships with a 3m mini-xlr to 1/8 cord w/ 1/4 adapter, I think most people would prefer the coiled cord which they sell as an option.The suspension may 'feel' a bit insecure at first, and the pads may wiggle a bit if you shake your head really hard. a manual tension adjustment on the suspension might be a nice addition.You really need a case for your studio headphones. As far as I know there isn't one available for these.                    Most opinions aren't worth the text they're typed in, especially in the highly subjective world of sound. But there are common grains in headphone reviews that tend to ring true, and can help you narrow your search. I found these after comparing over a dozen pairs of phones at my local shop and I HIGHLY urge you to do the same (that experience is invaluable in narrowing your preferences). That being said - here's what caught my eyes (or rather ears) about the K240s. Firstly, yes I do own comparable over-ear phones - Sennheiser HD518s and (formerly) Audio Technica ATH-M50s. Each has their advantage, but to be quite honest, at this price range there is no 'perfect holy grail' headphone... only the one that works best for *your* tastes. So what's to like about these over my other phones?Compared to M50s - the K240s are very light and comfortable. This a huge point of emphasis for me, as the M50s (for me anyway) were just plain uncomfortable to wear. Reviewers complain about the M50's clamping pressure, but I found the headband was particularly unforgiving despite the padding. The M50s were also among the heaviest phones I've tried, and I was constantly aware of this weight on my scalp/head. The K240s are feather light in comparison and have a nice wide self-adjusting headband. You pop em on and you don't have to constantly fidget with them, which is quite a feat of modern engineering (especially when you consider how simple the mechanism is, ha!). Sound-wise I think the M50s were a tiny bit more extended in the high end, although they sounded very dark overall to me. I interpret the K240s to be more even-toned and warmer with a nice (but not quite as extended) bass response. In other words, the M50's had a little more punch but a little less fullness in the lower end. I enjoyed both, but the comfort issue was the nail in the coffin for my M50s.Compared to HD518s - the K240s still have a slight edge in comfort, although the larger HD518s are also fairly lightweight. The real difference is sound quality, and the K240s are simply more balanced than the Senns. The HD518s have an incredibly wide and lush soundstage which is not quite matched by the AKGs, but they sometimes suffer from weird resonance issues and lack much of the lower frequency bass response of the K240s. The Senns (to their credit) are easier to drive and sound "bigger" but not necessarily better.In conclusion, I believe these headphones are a deal if you can get them for under a bill. Legendary reputation, detachable mini XLR cord, comfort, and warm even-toned sound make these a nice all-around headphone. If I had to sum them up in one or two sentences - These aren't the best in any one category, but they do cover all the bases well and are quite forgiving of recording flaws. A great all-around middle of the road headphone and an excellent headphone value when compared to others in this price range. I would buy them again in a heartbeat and they've become my current preferred phones. Very happy here.                    ** Update **Since writing this review a number of years ago, the AKG K240s have reduced significantly in price. As such, the comparisons are not quite fair anymore (although who knows what the prices will do in the future). Also, considering that these are now selling in the range of 50% the list price, I would have to give these headphones four stars in comparison to similarly priced models. I'm still underwhelmed with their sound without a good headphone amp, and I still think they are overrated, but it's a much better value and certainly worth checking out at this price.** Original Review **I've used the AKG K240S headphones for a few years now and I remain mystified at all the rave reviews here on Amazon. My experience may be different than some reviews, so I'll explain my approach. I do sound art, composition/production, and I listen for fun. Those are three different types of listening that typically require three different types of headphones. The thing is, out of my six pairs, these AKGs are my least favorite in every category.We'll start with listening for pleasure since that's what the majority of readers are looking for. Despite the rather low 55-ohm impedance, I don't feel like portable devices can drive these adequately. I've never been impressed with their bass response. I'm not looking for anything really heavy, but when I'm listening to an album with punchy bass, it doesn't translate through these cans. The midrange is decent, but not very exciting. The highs are definitely on the dull side. I've heard plenty of headphones give me sparkling, crystalline highs, but not this pair. If you're on a budget, the $69 SR60 are a much better bet. You can easily drive them with an iPod and get a rich, full-bodied sound. The Grados are just a lot more fun to listen to. I realize that the Sennheiser HD600 Over-Ear Open Dynamic Hi-Fi Professional Stereo Headphones (Black) are a bit pricer, but they're a night-and-day improvement as well, but at 300ohms impedance, you'll definitely need a headphone amp to get a good sound.Next, we'll talk about production work. I use a nice Digidesign audio interface, so I have plenty of power to drive the headphones. These work for tracking and monitoring, and the sealed design provides a little isolation, but at the same time, I've never felt that they gave me a clear picture of what the finished recording would sound like. Once I listened through some good speakers or a better pair of headphones, I'd notice details that remained hidden with the AKGs. They don't have the clinical precision of the Etymotics in-ear monitors, nor the isolation. They don't match the bass response of similarly priced Sennheisers either. As an alternative to the AKGs in the production/recording/mixing category, I'd highly recommend the beyerdynamic DT 770 Stereo Headphones. It provides superior isolation, excellent bass response, a better fit, and better construction. The Etymotic ER-4P Portable In-Ear Earphones are also useful for certain types of studio work, although they probably shouldn't be your only pair of headphones.The other major factor is comfort. The circular design fits around your ear, but usually squashes part of it. My ears aren't abnormally big, but they don't quite fit perfectly. Sennheiser's elliptical design seems to solve this problem. The AKGs are very light weight and they don't put much pressure on your head, but they also don't stay in place very well. If you move your head, the ear pieces are going to slide. This isn't a deal-breaker by any means, but it's just another reason why I don't like this model. The Beyer DT770s also beat the AKGs in this area. They use a circular design, but the driver doesn't touch your ear, and a nice velvety material is used for the ear-pad. They're a little bit heavier and they grip your head a little tighter, but you can move around and they don't budge.I don't recommend the AKG K240s. If you're an iPod user, you're not going to get a satisfyingly full sound without adding a headphone amplifier. If you're listening with a more powerful system, you'll get a decent sound, but not an amazing sound. Rich is not a word I would use to describe the K240s. If you're using these in the studio for recording, production, or mastering, you're not going to get a satisfactory level of detail. Overall, these are adequate and, all things considered, an improvement over many headphones out there. Perhaps I'm being too critical. The fact remains that I own four other pairs of headphones, each with better qualities than the AKGs.Also, I've reviewed the Beyerdynamic DT 770s and the Etymotics ER-4Ps on Amazon, if you're interested in more detail on those models.                    The sound quality of these headphones is unbelievable. I was floored when I first heard them. The depth of bass I can achieve - while at the same time having crystal clear highs - is epic, to say the least.These headphones are also remarkably comfortable. I haven't worn them for an extended period of time yet, but I can imagine being able to wear them for hours. They're very light and easy on the ears.My one beef about these headphones is the cord. My old headphones had a spiral cord, so it wasn't nearly as long but still extended when I needed it to. These have a straight cord, which is a little cumbersome given the purpose for which I use these headphones. However, this is almost a non-issue - these headphones still deserve a solid 5 stars, and I can probably find a way to remedy the issue of the cord length (bundle up the excess cord with an elastic or something).I would highly recommend these to anyone who needs a pair of really good headphones for a relatively low price.                    I bought these about 3 years ago to replace the K240M that I had. The K240M had several issues - its 600 ohms impedance, and the non-replaceable cable.For some reason, my cats love AKG headphones and kept chewing the cord.This K240s was a godsend . I bought them and 5 replacement cords. I'm down to the last one. I keep forgetting to pack them in my drawer after use.I have hundreds of cables in my house between my computer, home theater, home recording studio, and my cats only chew these, for some reason.Also, the sound quality is insanely great and accurate. I have been using these recently to monitor recordings . These are more revealing than any speakers ever will be. Last saturday I recorded a harpsichord. I had 2 pairs hooked up to the recording station, including these. The other was a Sony 700DJ heapdhone. The Sony's sounded really dead. Like something was off. Too much bass, not enough treble. There was no mistaking the accuracy of the playback of the AKG, since I was sitting right next to the instrument and performer. It was almost like the real thing.I see that these have dropped quite a bit in price since I bought them. At this price I might just have to get a second pair.                    The AKG K240 Studio Monitor headphones are a pair that every musician, recording hobbyist and lover of sound and music owes themelves to try. They produce a soundfield much broader, accurate and detailed than many headphones sold at this price, and are incredibly durable and comfortable to wear.I've gotten 10 years out of my first pair (they still work!) and recently picked up several other pairs for my studio. Many musicians i work with are swooned by their own performances the first time i let them monitor with these. A common reaction upon first experience is to quickly check to make sure the studio monitors aren't on too, as the stereo field is that life-like. This is due to the semi-open design, which allows the sound to breathe much more than just get piped into your head.As far as the type of tone you get from most headphones, i've found that many cans sound really unbalanced. Sometimes the mids are blaring, boxy or occasionally non-existent. The bass response in headphones is commonly hyped up beyond realism and the highs cut off right at 20khz. While this is fine for most material on CD or most mp3's, modern recording mediums have transcended the 22khz 'wall' of what was once believed to be the peak of perceptible hearing. For what it's worth, these headphones accommodate that extended range, with sound reproduction capability 15-25,000hz (more of a feeling than a sound that low or high). This is perhaps part of the reason they sound so broad and natural in monitoring situations, or while listening to HD audio from Digital Radio or DVD's, for example.I own many other brands of headphones, including a few pairs from Sennheiser, Grado, Sony, Denon, and Audio Technica. The type of headphone you get for this price-point is usually lacking in overall detail and stereo definition. The closest two pairs i own in quality and build are the Sennheiser HD-280 Professional Headphones and Grado Prestige Series SR80i Stereo Headphone. Sennheisers HD280 pro are aimed at recording professionals, and they pump bass and overall volume more powerfully, but the spectrum seems rather dramatic, with more of a scooped frequency response that dips around 2khz and pulls up below 90hz and above 6khz. This makes everything sound more 'excited' but not very accurate and fatiguing after more than a few hours. It is worth noting that the HD280 pro's are closed back, and designed to fit really snug. The AKG k240s's by comparison are more natural in tone to my ears, less powerfully slanted in the bass but accurate both in translation to other speakers and in terms of the stereo field. Grado's offering in this price range fare much more favorably; with a less excited low end, perfect midrange definition, and are likely a better purchase than the Sennheisers, but i still prefer the AKG's broad and open sound stage presentation and fatigue-less wearing.There are some negatives to these headphones though. The semi-closed back design means that these headphones leak sound at all volumes. this means that using these at high volumes in places that require relative silence is an impossibility. Conversely, they won't block out the outside world all that well either unless turned way up. Using them in recording situations in proximity to microphones can be an issue, and the power requirements are higher than most portable amplifiers provide. In fact, you may even find yourself wanting more volume out of your laptop or computer's soundcard. I'm currently listening to them through an M-audio fast-track pro audio interface and have the volume at about 95%. in my studio, where i have a dedicated headphone amplifier i don't have this problem, but at the computer i occasionally hear material even at full volume that just isn't loud enough. If you plan on using these primarily with a portable audio setup, i would consider the power of your jack carefully before making this purchase.All of this said, The AKG k240 Studios are a staple of my home and studio listening arsenal. True, you can find better headphones out there, but not for this price. In fact, you won't find a better pair for double this. Do your ears a favor and try these headphones.
!###Coming from a pair of enclosed Sony headphones I originally thought the bass response was too light. However, after listening to professionally mastered tracks and building tunes from the ground up on these headphones, I rate them highly. They give a very even flat response which is what you want in a pair of headphones for monitoring. I like to use these in combination with my closed headphones, crappy computer speakers, and car stereo when mixing down and mastering tracks. I can say that since I started using these my tunes have sounded better (not too much bass or overly loud elements) and more even in different listening enviornments.I've only used two other headphones other than these for monitoring so my experience is limited in comparison to others.                    Great sounding headphones and very comfortable.  Bought these to replace my Sony V6's of 10 years (broken due to my nephew sitting on them), which were still in great shape.  So, $150 was my maximum amount that I was willing to spend on a pair of headphones for home, since I already have my pair of Shure e5's for when I'm out-and-about.  I decided on these after reading a whole bunch of reviews and after trying out several headphones (Sony V6's/MDR-V900's, Sennheiser HD-280's, Bose Triports), but the K240 stood out as the clear winner for me, even next to the more expensive K271's.  The headphones are extremely comfortable and were made even more so when I added a set of Nice Cans headphone covers (the stock pleather ones got a little sweaty and sticky when I wore them for more than an hour).  The suspension system is pure genius taking the weight and tension off the ears and putting it on the top of my head, even after wearing for 4 or more hours.  Also, if the cord ever get's destroyed or develops a short, it can be replaced by unplugging the existing one and putting a new one on.  As a matter of fact, each individual part can be bought from AKG and replaced if one wears out (which I highly doubt).  All in all, after a month of use, these have completely left the V6's in the history books.  As time goes on and the drivers loosen up even more, the sound gets better and better!  They do need a little time to sound as good as their potential, like my Shure's, so have a little patience.  I would recommend these phones to anyone, especially if using an ipod or any other low power audio device.  Great phones and enjoy!                    The AKG K 240S is the replacement for the K240M.  Impedance has been reduced from 600 ohms to 55 ohms.  Bass response has been extended and midrange is flatter in response.  Consider buying the K 240 studio phones in the MK II package and you will have spare cord and spare earpads.                    This veteran model is the ruling monarch of the studio-monitor level headphone kingdom. You may search high and low, pay a king's ransom for trendy, colorful set of cans, but you will NEVER (let me repeat it for the sake of clarity:) EVER find better more transparent and true-to-the-source set of phones.Easy to use and wear, interchangable earpads and cords make it a practical choice as well. The sound is lively, extremely detailed, no frequency-range is too inflated or &#34;beautified&#34; yet the sound is never 'cold&#34; or to technical. They are a pleasure to listen to and are somehwat more forgiving than other monitor style sets in cases of not-so-great-quality sources (e.g.: older MP3 files with lower sampling rate; audio tapes or radio quality sources).Use it for recording or prodduction, audiophile level listening or just fun.Less suitable for DJ work or for social settings seince it is not closed-back and leaks sound.Given its price - it is one of the best value-per-money headphones in the market right now.                    I had a previous version of these headphones in my first home studio. I am so glad that I found these headphones again. They are true &#34;Studio Monitors&#34; with even, uncolored sound. Love them! Super quiet with the xlr plugs.                    I'm going to start off this review by saying this: if you don't have a big head, you might find these unwieldy.  These suckers are BIG--much bigger than the AKG K-142 HD's they are replacing.The build is light yet sturdy, and they feel wonderful on my admittedly large head.  I'm a huge fan of AKG's self-adjuting headband, I find that it always sits very comfortably on my head--it's a wonderful piece of engineering!I also like the little gold accents on the headphones, however, I wish the gold and resin stickers on the end of each of the earcups was replaced with inlaid metal in the same finish as the gold rings around the earcups--it would look a lot more polished and &#34;grown-up&#34;.  But overall, they're not &#34;flashy&#34; headphones, you won't get any &#34;swag&#34; for wearing them, but they are definitely &#34;elegant&#34;.  I like the idea of refined, classic style, and I think these K240's fit the bill perfectly.  I want my headphones to play music, rather than to play the role of a fashion statement (I'm looking at you, Beats and others!)The sound is very...neutral?  You won't find it blowing you away on house/techno/hip-hop/R&B tracks--until you hit the vocals.These are very clearly intended for use in a studio for monitoring the various inputs for a track.  I personally love the feeling I get from these headphones--it's very realistic for the price.I haven't tried the Grado S80i's yet, but for now, I'm extremely satisfied with the K240's.  I can play music through my phone, computer, and iPad, all at reasonable volume.  But I can also plug them into my receiver with the included jack adapter for even better quality sound.I can say with complete certainty that these headphones were money well spent.                    All in all these k240's are a good buy.  The open ear, light design makes these the most comfortable headphones I've worn, and causes very little to no strain on the ears with long term use.  Because of the open design you can't expect any isolation from these, so they are more for studio use or any other place that has decent acoustic treatment or isolation.  Don't expect these to be good for going out to do field recording with.If you're looking for accurate sound, these give it.  They have a wide frequency range without giving too much boost to the bass.  There is a little boost, but its much better than most headphones you'll get for under $200.  I use these headphones primarily to edit fx and dialog in the later hours when it's inappropriate to crank up the volume in an apartment.  I notice that they give a better representation of what I'm hearing than my current speakers, which curve the lows to the sub woofer and boost everything above 7kHz.  These have helped a lot to do noise removal too.My only complaint about these is that they are rated at 91dB, so they are pretty quiet.  You won't be able to give these enough volume with an ipod or anything similar.  My last headphones were rated at 107dB, and they isolated 40dB of ambient noise.  Those gave me the ability to listen quietly, but crank it up if there was a trouble spot that I needed to pay attention to while editing.  The K240's are not that type of headphone.  With my Roland dp-990 they work great and I can get them louder than anybody should ever have them.  But I also have a bose companion system that I hook the headphones up to when I work, and at full volume (or close to) the listening level is good, but with the open ear design, any noise happening in your environment drastically affects your listening ability.  I just throw a compressor on my master fader and it helps when I need the volume boost.  Over all I would recommend them, just make sure the device you're hooking them up to has a lot of power, because you'll be turning the volume up more than with some other headphones.                    I have a set of these from the mid-80s and love them.  I needed a second pair, and did some research.  As I asked around for recommendations and tried many other sets, I kept coming back to the AKG-K240s.When I got the new set, I did a comparison of the new to the old.  Frankly, except for the new ones being more comfortable, I couldn't tell much difference; the old ones still sounded like new.  These will last you a very long time.  For most use, you can't go wrong with them.They ARE open, though.  If you are using them on-stage and want the headphones to block out some of the sound around you, you would be better off with a set intended for that purpose.                    I would have rated these as a 4 or 5 until they broke. It turns out the speaker assemblies are held to the headband by a single tiny screw and a low-grade plastic cap. Seriously AKG?  They're still under warranty, but what a disappointment.Otherwise, they are very comfortable; I could wear these for hours & hours. The tradeoff is that they are a little loose - I had trouble keeping them in place when playing drums, but great for sitting in front of a computer.I replaced the AKGs with some Audio-Technicas which are louder, still quite comfy and seem to be of much more substantial construction.Update: Attempting to get service with AKG/Harmon under warranty. No response to email for one week.
!###These headphones sound fantastic. As some other reviewers have mentioned, they don't block any outside sound, so if you had the volume low (why?) you could clearly hear everything around you.Crank your weak laptop sound card up all the way and it will sound great, but amplify these monitors a little bit more like I do (I use a Behringer Xenyx 802 Premium 8-Input 2-Bus Mixer with Xenyx Mic Preamps and British EQs) and it can make your ears explode with joy. Go ahead, listen to some music. Or play a video game. Yessssssssss                    IT's a high dynamic range. Making sound very clear like my old one that I brought before.Good design.                    The best head phones I have ever owned....all my music..+20gigs...MAKES YOUR MUSIC SOUND BETTER..Bought these at Amazon because of the lower delivered price..bought these after I compared them along side 10 other brands...Its a personal opinion...They just sounded better...I use these every day when I work on the computer.                    They have a good sound and don't get uncomfortable after wearing them for a long time.  It's actually bad to listen to some music through them, with a good headphone amp, because you can hear all the high-frequency flaws and imperfections in the recording.                    I've got a small project studio and needed a pair of decent headphones for monitoring.  I didn't spend too much time investigating the different makes/models...I knew AKG had a pretty good reputation and I expected the K240's would be a definite upgrade over the consumer-grade cans I was using.Now, I'm not Daddy Warbucks, so $100 was a fairly substantial investment for me for just a pair of headphones, but I'm satisfied with them.  They seem to represent the sounds nice and clear...I'm not going to get into what the frequency range is or anything like that because I'm honestly not that technical.The headphones seem to block out the majority of the noise in the household.  The only minor complaint that I have is that prolonged wearing of these headphones seems to bother my ears.  I don't think I have huge dumbo-like ears, but maybe I do!In my opinion, these are a worthwhile investment although I must also say that I have no other pro-grade headphones in which to compare these with.  If you're like me and you were using a pair of $10-30 headphones that you bought at Walmart...you should be happy with the K240's.                    Fantastic product for the price.  They are superbly comfortable, crisp and detailed in their reproduction, and plenty loud even without a headphone amp.  The cord is long and detachable, protecting it from damage and making it easy to replace without having to buy a whole new set of headphones.  It's no wonder 240s have been the standard in studios for decades.  You can find better headphones, but once you pass the price point of the 240s, the return isn't worth the money you're shelling out.                    Like the title of my review says, they're quite comfortable.  If you intend to wear headphones for long periods of time, these are pretty much the way to go.  the one downside though, is that the ear pads are made of a leather-type material.  this means that they tend to get a little warm if you wear them for a while.  what you should really look into is a pair of headphones with a soft fabric on them.  they won't get nearly as hot (not to say that these are unbarable), but you'll be comfortable AND cool.  Oh, and I also feel compelled to mention that Dave Chapell sports these puppies in a couple acts on his show (where he's rapper)                    Quality is awesome, using them as a home theater headphone. Great bass response without sounding flat or muffled.                    I really love these, I use them for everything from editing music to playing Half Life 2, they have great response through all the ranges, even good bass, which is abnormal for Studio phones, but nice! 2 of the best features of these are the self adjusting headband (makes them very comfortable), and the removable cord (allowing you to upgrade your cord, get a curly cord, or a higher grade cable). I don't get sweaty ears wearing these, which is what I usually hate when vinyl covered ear pads, and they are comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time without taking them off-I've had them on for 6 hours or more some times. the cord is nice and nice, overall these were exactly what I was looking for in my headphone purchase.                    First of all i would like to start by introducing my self. I am a film music composer for 15 years and i usually use 2 pairs of headphones sets in the studio. This specific AKG 240 are NOT being produced for loud music or casual listening. They are manufactured for sound engineers and studio use for people like me want to listen to the details in the mixing process during production. I rate them 5 stars for such a cheap solution and this model has been an industry standard for years. But i wouldn't recommend these headphones for recreational purposes, such us music listening, ipods, mobile phones that support MP3 format, Home Hi-Fi etc. Reason is that they are made as i said for mixing and not for listening. If you are NOT a professional, you will be disappointed. These headphones respond to high frequencies for listening details to the mixing and have almost no bass. These headphones have a low volume but fine detail so it takes all it's strength to the detail of sound quality than loudness. This is the reason i use two studio headphones. One for bass frequencies and one for detail. Hope i helped!
!###I've had them all... Just tried the K240 (kept them for three weeks) and ended up returning them. I ended up with the Sony V6 and am very satisfied.The K240 are the most comfortable of the three I've tried but the sound is rather lacking. Like the other reviews have said there is very little bass response. The Mids are real dominant, especially the high-mids... They really, really didn't sound good when listening to 320k mp3s on my ipod. But they did sound better when I listened to my mixes through my IO Dock (I'm using the IO Dock as a recording interface). However, they didn't sound better enough for me to keep them...The Sony V6 are great. Maybe I've just gotten used to the way they sound as I've been using them since 1990. I had a pair that lasted 10 years (until they got sat on). I can hear the entire frequency range and like the way they feel (they're a bit too tight at first but will loosen up over time). They are a kinda muddy but not enough to be a deal breaker and its always helped my mixes sound brighter in the end. I can listen to my ipod or the IO dock/mixer and it all sounds great. And, yes, the ear pads are going to crack, flake off, and make a mess in a year or two... There are replacements that I'll end up buying and I wish I didn't have to. The quality of there sound makes up for this inconvenience. I wish the cord was detachable and that they were as comfortable to wear as the K240.The Sony V600 sound super-muddy and have all the other negative issues that the V6 have. I've noticed that they make my head uncomfortably ho when I wear them, too. Stay away from them.                    they fit nicely and the release at the headset works well but any song with notable bass sounds crappy like airplane headphones.if you listen to only acoustic guitar music these are great, if you listen to skrillex, deadmau5, five finger death punch, incubus, or anything with any kind of bass (drum, guitar or synthetic) forget them, there's better headphones out there for the same amount of money.                    I've only owned 3 headphones - AKG K271, these, and The Audio Tecnica M50s.  The M50s blow both out of the water.  I was so underwhelmed when I first wore these it was shocking.  I tried to return them a few weeks ago but it was passed the deadline to return products.  These headphones lack clarity, they have no bass, and are extremely overpriced.  For an extra $50, you can have an outstanding pair of headphones instead of these.  Especially if you listen to music heavy in bass, you do *NOT* want these headphones.  Some AKGs have some bass, but these have very little.  They are just uninspiring, and it really degrades the music listening experience.  Get the M50s, you will thank me later.edit: I want to make it very clear that the lack of bass is not my only reason for disliking these headphones.  I found the mediums and highs to be very washed out and unclear.  Additionally, these headphones will not get loud at all.  With my system's volume at 100% AND with a sound boost, at the highest volume setting they were still not very loud.  What I am saying is that with an extra $50 you can buy a much better set of headphones, whether they be M50s or not.  These are just a very poor set of headphones for the money, and I would advise staying away from this model.  AKG as a brand is good, and I liked my K271's (though I prefer my M50s), but these headphones are rubbish.                    I really wish I could give these headphones a good review, honestly I do, but the build quality is so poor that I cannot give them more than 2 stars. As far as sound goes they're fantastic, especially for their price. They have a very honest and well balanced sound, with accurate reproduction of both bass and higher frequencies alike. However, none of that matters when they're broken, and they break VERY easily, and this is coming from someone who treats their hardware with extreme care! One of the features that is listed for these headphones is that you can listen with one ear by twisting one can off to the side of your head. I did this frequently during use, and after a couple of months it caused the right can to just BREAK OFF. Upset, but determined to continue using them because of their exceptional sound, I soldered the wires back in place and superglued the can back on and continued using them. This happened twice. Now it has become obvious that the right can has developed a bad connection, and now I've finally given up on them. If they still worked, I might actually give these a 5 star review because they sound so fantastic, but that means nothing when they're broken. My frustration is accentuated by the fact that I've gotten so used to these I can no longer stand to listen to consumer level headphones but I'm forced to for the time being.In summary:They sound fantastic, but the cheap flimsy plastic they're made of breaks very easily, and all the sound quality in the world doesn't matter when they're broken. You're better off finding a pair of cans at a similar price point that aren't entirely made of plastic.                    There are probably better studio headphones out there, but I used to use these in school, so there was a nostalgic reason why I bought them. Still great quality sound.                    Overall it has very good sound quality, but lacks bass. My earbuds have more bass than this headphone. It leaks A LOT of sound. If you don't mind the lack of bass and you are looking for a good quality headphone, this is for you.                    Unfortunately this product was surprisingly disappointing. I've purchase other AKG products in the past, but this headphone just did not reproduce the quality of the sound I was looking.  Some distortions in the bass frequencies.                    The product is not bad. I got it as a gift and she loves it. It really deserve more like a 3.75, closer to 4 but not quite. I would recommend buying it. Bass is a little weak, its really a "clear" headphone. Really closer for what DJs want than for audiophiles. The acoustics and resonance is weak and it absolutely does not filter out any sound. I have a pair of Audio Technica A700s and I like those way more and would totally recommend them more.Audio Technica ATH-A700 Headphones                    I bought 2 of these headphones for my 20 and 23 year-old sons (both musicians).  They had been highly recommended by a salesman at Guitar Center, who said they were widely used in recording studios.  The sound quality was ok and they fit the head very comfortably, but the game-breaker was the volume.  Neither set played loud enough...we tried plugging into iPads, iPods, computer, and direct from a keyboard.  With everything turned up &#34;to 11&#34;, they weren't loud enough.  We had thought the first set we tried was faulty, but then the second set was exactly the same.  Amazon was great about the return, even though both sets had been opened.
!###I bought these to replace a lost pair of Grados SR-80's.  After using them for most rock and EDM stuff, I'm a little underwhelmed by the sound.  You get to hear everything, but it doesn't particularly make your music sound better so to speak.  Besides that they're really comfortable.  I'm not an expert with this stuff, but I can't say this is the best sound for this price range.                    I'm bummed these were just too big for my head :(. they fit halfway down my ears. Great sound quality.                    These are good, i have k271mkII and k-240 and Sennheiser 518 and many small ones, the K 240 has better bass and and 518 is much better, but little compromising on the rest. The 271 is awesome on everything except the lows, i mean if you are a rock and roll and classic guy these will be good, but if you are a sort of a person who wants a little more bass bang the 240 are good, and the Sennheiser 518 sound completely different they are good too, but i find the 271 more crisp and clear. And ya they are made in China which kind of ruins the whole wow part, they are comfortable, i like the detachable cable part.                    These are an excellent choice for mixing music open so there not tight like my Sennheisers that's what your looking for if your a sound engineer something comfortable and not noticeable. plus AKG  puts out great product                    When I bought this product I was expecting a lot from it as I have Harman/Kardon laptop speakers (AKG is a Harman company) which are absolutely amazing when it comes to sound quality. I bought this intending on buying a pair of headphones that would be able to provide good amounts of bass without compromising sound quality, but this didn't do that at all. When I 1st listened to them it sounded like the bass was replaced with treble, it was an indescribable experience and was horrible. As I burned it in for an hour it sounded much better in terms of sound quality, but there was very little bass. The overall sound quality was actually less than that of my laptop's speakers believe it or not, which makes these only worth about $60 at most. The build quality was a bit sketchy which is surprising having seen how they make these on How It's Made. If you're looking for cheap headphones with good sound quality these may do it for you, but you can find better elsewhere.                    Sounds good but does not pack the bass punch I was expecting. For more bass punch one would have to go deeper there pockets.                    I picked these up on sale after accidentally trashing my Audio Technica'sQuick breakdown:+Very comfortable+Nice quality, crystal clear sound+Open (can be a pro or a con depending how you look at it) You can actually hear outside sounds.+Won't break easily-Doesn't really have the deep bass like some headphones can get.-Volume is a little too low for my taste-Really long regular (non-coiled) wire can be a bit of a nuisanceVery comfortable, much more comfortable than my previous pair.The construction is such that it doesn't feel like it would be broken easily.Sound quality seems fine. I'm not qualified to really speak about the technical detailsit seems fine to me but didn't really 'wow' me like my Audio Technica's did.My main issue is with the volume, I have to crank up the volume to almost max to even get a decent listening level.I'm not talking extremely loud either, just loud enough so I can actually enjoy the music and hear every little detail,I have to turn it up very high to enjoy my music with these. I have no idea why this is.                    GOOD QUALITY SOUND BUT MADE FROM CHEAP PLASTIC THE CIRCULAR PLASTIC BEHIND THE LEFT EAR PIECE CRACKED SO I NEED TO GLUE IT                    I had older 240's for many years when I upgraded to these. I paid $200. at that time. They seem to need a perfect amp to sound right. They lack bass and good definition. Even with a headphone amp,on my ipod they sound "off". I've been using them now to listen to TV through my headphone amp and I have been mostly happy. However over time the connection/plug where they disconnect to the headphone has become loose enough to "disconnect" the sound.The headphones are still good but I can't use them due to this issue. I don't know if the current production run fixed this problem, but I'd advise against buying a headphone that has this feature.Not even listed at the AKG site. Now using my Grado SR80's (a really sweet sound with a tough cord!                    I just purchased these AKG K 240 headphones through Amazon. The ones I got didn't say made in Austria. The box it came in said made in China. I thought maybe it was counterfeit goods until I visited the AKG website and found the same headphones and clicked to see that they provide no audio frequency bandwith or other technical specifications. Even my cheap $15 sony earbuds gives me this information. Am I to assume that these are your &#34;fool the public&#34; line of head phones? Please respond.
!###thes are awsome headphones they get loud and have sudiophile sound. i listen to some classical music like william joseph and thes headphones really just bring out the sound it is almost like the music is in your head. some people claim that these headphones dont have enough bass but to me it sounds perfectly level. just like i like it. despite the size of these headphones they are extremely light weight and are so comfortabl you can easily forget about them. another nice feature is that the cord is replaceable. that is extremely helpfull if you are going to pay this much for headphones and are known for breaking headphone cords.. i have noticed that the cord is extremely tough. since i am known for uninteninally abusing headphone cords.                    I've been looking for some really good headphones for a while now, and after much looking, I impulsively bought these. After a few days of worrying that they wouldn't be all they were hyped up to be, they finally arrived. After reading some Audiophile forums, I found that its good to "break in" your head phones by just letting them play music at a medium level for a few hours. Outa the box, these things were awesome. At first the bass was a tad muddy, but a half hour of play time cleaned that up. Five hours later they sound even better. They have a 55 ohm Independence, which for non-techie people means that it takes a bit of juice to runs these, but I've been playing them all day on my iPod, and the battery life has barley dropped. They are really comfy, 5 hours in and it still feels nice, no head crunching pressure. My only complaints are the fit on your head, and the cord. They are a tad lose due to the auto adjust system that fits snugly to your head. It's really comfy, but if you start looking around every where they will slip and slid a little. The cord is the most annoying feature. At 9 ft long it can get in the way, but just stuffing the excess to the bottom of your pocket fixes that, defiantly not a deal breaker. Overall, I'm Highly impressed with these headphones. They give off enough sound from an ipod to cover up average conversation, which is great if your in college and wanna have some peace away from your roomies when your studying (I'll have to test this next year). I'd Highly recommend them for any one from the casual user the music junkie, these "Cans" are awesome.                    These headphones are great and sound awesome. they are very comfortable and because they go around the ear sometimes hot in warm places. i kind of like the 10 ft long cable but it depends. the one thing that kind of bugs me is that if i plug them into my phone or ipad they are not extremely loud. even at max volume i dont think they are very loud. im hoping someone can give me an answer to this problem, if its an amp, which one in specific. but when i plug em in to the speakers in my computer, i am amazed at how loud they make em, they sound perfect. i was also kind of hoping they could block out sound, but sadly no. it makes up for it with the quality of the sound though.these headphones are good for most music, i havnt found music these headphones dont sound good in yet. but yea in all, the sound is amazing but not that loud by themselves, the cable dosnt bug me as much, they are very comfortable but sometimes warm,why do mine say made from china?,and i would recommend these headphones, they are cool, im not gonna lie these headphones leak sound alot but they are not bad. again if someone could help me with the volume issue.                    These headphones are the best headphones I've ever had. Not only is the sound quality amazing, but the comfort is awesome. I can barely feel the headphones against my head while wearing them. They get extremely loud which is awesome. I have them hooked up to an amp, so I'm not sure how they sound without an amp, but I've been told they do not get as loud. If you're looking for good headphones without paying for $100, get these.                    These headphones are awesome. In a word, they are comfortable. They adjust to your head size, unlike most headphones where you have to set the ear length manually.  One note they are semi-open which means they don't block out external noise. I wouldn't call it a negative, just something to be aware of, they wouldn't be good on an airplane for example.                    I bought myself a pair of these and loved them. I wound up buying my wife and sone a set as well. I now find myself wishing that I hadn't bought these for anyone else as they are now VERY uncomfortable to wear. The ear pads on my headphones are all cracked now and are extremely uncomfortable to wear. I do wear my headphones often and for long hours but AKG should have designed ear pads which don't crack because people are wearing them a lot. To buy replacement ear pads (I need two) I'll need to buy them from some unknownn sources (as Amazon doesn't sell them) and pay roughly $22.00 to buy two replacement pads (that's almost 1/4 of what the purchase price for a new set of headphones is).I advise that you NOT buy these and look for other choices as I am sure your ear pads will wind up cracking after a year or two of use like mine did.I would have initially rated them 5-stars for sound and comfort but now I rate them 2-stars because of extreme discomfort while wearing them and I can't enjoy the sound now.                    These headphones are the industry standard for headphone monitors in recording studios because they sound like the average person's home stereo.  That being said, they have virtually no bass response.  I suspect because the average person's home stereo doesn't have much bass response.  I would not recommend these headphones for casual listening.  If you're looking for headphones for casual in the $100 price range I would recommend the Sennheiser HD280's.  They have less fidelity in the higher frequency range than the K240's,  but have much better bass response. Also, the HD280's earpads press close to your ears and have excellent noise cancelation.  The k240's rest sloppily on your ears and do very little to cancel out outside noise.  Some audio professionals use the k240's in mixdown to get an idea of what their mix will sound like on the average person's home stereo, but I say look some where else than the k240s to find out what your mix will sound like.                    These are wonderful for sitting back and enjoying the music.  The ear contour frequency response can dress up an MP3 like a treat.  Everything through these headphones sounds fantastic.Unfortunately that makes them practically useless for analytic purposes and they should never be taken into a studio.  These "sound like" a concert.  That step comes after mixing, not during, and not before.  Keep these at home and enjoy their bliss.  They're not for work.                    ear pads are cheap thin plastic, not like the old ones. head band is also made of stiff thin plastic, unlike the old ones. theme here ?  sound is ok for voice and hearing whats going on, but again not as good as the old ones. they really do seem like $20-$30 pair, not what they are charging. all the money of went into the TA3 connectors to make the cable easy to replace.  the upside is they are light and reasonably comfortable for open ear design. not for critical use where isolation is needed like field audio recording, then the HD280's are the best price / performer hands down.                    MADE IN CHINA MADE IN CHINA MADE IN CHINA MADE IN CHINA MADE IN CHINA MADE IN CHINA MADE IN CHINAThey feel cheap and Amazon just dropped the price from $99 down to $81. . . .The global market really means producing/copying as cheap as possible.  It is sad to see a well established company like AKG take this route.They sound average--like a $30 pair of headphones.  They are difficult to drive with a mp3 player or other sources; they worked best with my mixer headphone output--it has a dedicated headphone IC with plenty of current capability.
!###I got these headphones after a friend recommended them to me and like them a lot. The sound is great, very clear, and they are SO comfortable! I wish I could have gotten them for less (I paid $98), but I feel it was worth the money.                    The sound is clear and neutral. It is not too bass-heavy and not entirely treble-heavy. A small problem I had with these headphones were that they were not loud enough. If you are a slave to loud headphones then you are probably going invest in an amplifier in the future. A bigger problem I encountered was the detachable cord. In my experience, the headphone cord tends to fray in time after about 4-5 months regular use. All in all, these are great headphones when it involves sound quality (disregarding volume) but craftsmanship needs improvement.                    At 55 ohms impedance, these headphones do benefit from having an amp---unless you don't mind having to crank up the volume on your laptop (I have used them with two Thinkpads and one Asus).  With my MP3 player (Cowon C2-16BS 16 GB Video Player, Black with Silver) I have to have the volume at 35 or higher (40 is max) though it sounds fine without an amp.  Anyway, I have a FiiO E07K Andes Portable USB DAC Headphone Amplifier, Black on the way, so will update this review when it gets here...am expecting/hoping it will be the icing on the cake.My Grado SR80s at 32 ohms do much better without an amp, but they are physically much less comfortable: the AKGs' earpads sit AROUND my ears rather than on top of them unlike the Grados, so aside from them getting a little warm (I might have to spring for the velour earpads sometime) I can happily wear them for hours and hours without my earlobes getting sore.  Also I can listen to music for hours and hours on them because they are so non-fatiguing: marvelously balanced and even have a slight treble roll-off, which is fine for someone getting on in years like me who's probably already lost a bit of the higher frequency hearing (above 15KHz).  The Grados on the other hand are impressive when you first plug them in because they are rather "hot"---the highest and lowest frequencies seem to be accentuated, which makes them kind of "fun" headphones especially if you listen to a lot of bass-heavy and/or high-tempo pop/dance or hard rock type music.The AKGs are particularly exquisite if you are into midrange-dominant music like jazz, classical, or vocal music: instruments and voices come across with remarkable realism in tonality and timbre, and quickly become very addictive.  Whereas on the Grados the midrange seemed rather thin and recessed, and overshadowed by the treble and bass.So really, it all depends on your preferences.  The physical comfort of the AKGs is less subjective, however: they are easily the most comfortable over-the-ear phones I've ever tried.  This is a HUGE factor worth considering.4 and 1/2 stars: 1/2 star deduction for the vinyl-covered earpads heating up my head, but I probably should've ordered the K240 Mk 2 version which come swith the velour earpads instead...kind of wish they had come with more breathable foam earpads like the Grados instead, but I imagine AKG chose not to because these insulate the sound better and form a better seal which allows for more bass.Speaking of which, you'd have to be a total BASS-HEAD to say that these babies don't put out enough bass...I find them to have MORE than adequate bass, and it's nice tight accurate bass not the sloppy boomy kind that teenagers are generally used to and have blaring out of their cheesy car subwoofers.Last point: sound leakage with this "semi-open" design was far less than anticipated.  You can only hear the music if blasting it; at casual/comfortable listening levels they were fine...I tried it out in a public library.  Certainly far less leakage than the Grados.  Haven't tried them out in a noisy environment yet to see how their sound isolation compares to my in-ear headphones, but that's not a fair fight anyway...I probably wouldn't recommend taking these with you on a flight!                    Yes, they sound amazing. From the lowest of low's, to the highest of high's. You can hear them all, literally. The volume is all the way up on my macbook, and they are clear as a whistle. Don't let the $99 dollar price fool you. They are just as good as a $300 set of headphone's. Get them, you won't regret it. I promise.                    I have used these phones since the 1980's both personnally and in the recording studio. They have performed brilliantly and withstood the rigors of studio and road life faithfully. I have found them to give true and uncolored audio reproduction.                    I had a pair of Grado SR90s, they worked very well on my ipod and sound good, however, these AKG 240S are a night and day difference.  The sound is amazing, they are comfortable for hours of listening.  Make sure you get the "Studio" version and prepare to enjoy your music.  These work fine on my ipod and iphone and notebook.  I am not using an amp at all for these, they play just fine on everything I have tried them on.                    I like everything about these headphones except that the stitching is starting to come out a little & they are a month old.  Real Nice.  Other than that, they are good.                    Long story short - the retro design looks great, and they sound really good for quieter settings and mellow music.  The sound is clear and good at moderate levels, but these are not designed to be cranked.  They're not good for loud rock, which is what I listen to mostly, but in quiet times with mellow music they are very good.  They are bulky with the older design, which was something I liked online but not when I put them on.  As an added bonus, you can remove the wire and dress up and look classy for your next steampunk party.
!###I have four pair of headphones costing between 20-50 dollars, including such brands as Sennheiser, Logitech, Sony, and Eton. They're all capable headphones but they're Closed-Back style, which, while keeping external sound out, is also harder on the ears and which, I've read, compromises sound. So for my ear safety and for a bigger sound, I opted for the AKG K24. Here's what I like: Good build quality, comfortable large ear gel ear cups, microjack fits in iPod without needing an adapter (true of all my other headphones). The sound is good, great even, but I wouldn't go so far to say they produce the "wow factor." However, be aware of the fact that I don't pump up the volume very loud because I don't want to blast my eardrums. Are they worth the price? That's a subjective question. For many who want to spend less on an Open-Ear headphone without compromising sound, I think most will be happy with the 20-dollar Audio-Technica ATH-MZX Open-Ear headphones.                    Headphones fell apart after about 3 months of use. The plastic part that holds the 2 metal bars that go across your head crumbled, and they wound up touching the metal screw in the middle (which shorts it, since those wires around the top actually carry the signal to the right speaker). I figured I'd be clever and repair it with solder/epoxy... which worked after some trial/error. But another 4-5 months later, and I'm experiencing the same problems, which leads me to think it has something to do with the way the bars torque when the phones bend slightly. The product wasn't thrown about or abused, but got regular daily use. As far as sound quality, it was very good for open-air headphones. Very easy to hear people trying to talk to me while gaming (which is what I bought them for). Just wish the quality had been a bit better.                    These were my first foray into "high end" headphones.  After breaking 3 pairs of $20-40 headphones during the last year I decided to spend some $ on quality (the construction of these is very good).  On first listen, these were very clear but not as much bass or volume as I expected.  I would describe them as very "accurate" - they don't add extra bass or treble.  Listening to them on my iPod shuffle and touch I found them a little quiet; Apple's headphones could blast at 10/10, while the little iPods could only drive these to maybe 7/10.  However, there is no way I can go back to listening to Apple's headphones; compared to these they sound like mud.  Also, MP3s ripped at 128k sound like lousy, even at 320k I can hear differences from the original CDs.  These cans have vinyl coverings that make my ears sweat after a while.  Overall, I am pleased but am tempted to spend a little more to try the Beyerdynamic DT770s.                    Have had Original AKG K-240's (600ohm) for many, many years.  Needed headphones that would be able to be powered by a Smartphone/Tablet/PC.  New one's still will need a real amp (receiver, etc.) or a headphone amp to get the most out of the new model, but, a PC sound card can get decent sound.  Love the sound (Open, clear, better bass than the originals (tight)), The Fit (lightweight, comfortable, self-adjusting).  Don't listen to the audio snobs, if you want a pair of good quality, inexpensive cans, you can't go wrong with these.  Remember, you have to &#34;Break-In&#34; any Dynamic headphones for at least 50 Hours at higher than normal levels to get the best sound out of them.                    Excelente sonido recomendado, no cansan los oidos, un sonido plano muy bueno para la mezcla, excelente dise&ntilde;o y precio, los recomiendo sin duda.                    I owned a pair of AKG 240s Headphones back in 2003-2008 and remember loving their comfort and open and clean sound... however, one earphones started to short out after tremendous abuse, and I ended up breaking them to the point of garbage trying to fix them myself (lesson learned).Anyways, I needed a more durable and "isolated" pair of headphones for the next few years while travelling and I got the Audio Technica MTH-50s and love them as well.  I still have them working great at 4 years old.Here come the "new" AKG 240s.  I was looking forward to that comfort and smoothness of sound.  I plugged them in and things feel great, but sound "harsh" in the mid-high frequencies.  Not at all as I "remember" them.  Maybe I have too accustomed to my MTH-50s, but there seems to be a very metallic sound in these new AKG 240s.I do not know if this newly perceived "harshness" is due to them now being manufactured in China, but they just do not sound as "pure" as I remember.Lets see if I can break them in for a few days.                    definitely one of the best products I've purchased and I've spent less money. fast and on time. thanks for everythnig                    I very like this phone. Its reproduce a big range of sounds. Very quality materials of construction and the cable is long too. I think low level when reproduced music. Dont have level button. If you wish a good headphons, this is THE product.                    1) When you first open these cans play pink noise through them for 2-6hours to burn in the drivers nicely.2) Remove the ear cushions and speaker foam pads (its every easy).  Rub the speaker cover/pad with your hands. Work them in till they feel much softer.3)Replace pads back in the headphones.This allows the trebled to pass through the foam much clearer and speeds up general burn in for these cans.The sound is very muddy when you get them, but after proper burn in they sound very, very, very smooth!!!!So, heres the Good: Great natural sounding, very clean and seriously smooth sonic characteristics. Comfort is what you would expect from a remake of the most popular studio cans. Very, very comfortable!!.Bad: Cable feels a little cheap, but it is replaceable. Requires more than average burn in. Requires a headphone AMP for proper volumes.Ugly: Nothing ugly for these cans!!!Probably the BEST headphones for Sub $100. Tested against Shure SRH 440, BoseAE2 (comfort test only lol), Audio Technica M30's.                    I purchased these headphones as a replacement for my Sony when they broke. I then bought another Sony MDR7506 as these sounded a little flat. I broke them in, and comparing them side by side with Sony MDR7506 the MDR7506 won on sound quality. I like open ear headphones though, they let your ears breath a little, and these are definitely more comfortable for a large head. Not a bad buy, but if you want analytical headphones, go with Sony.Update: I use these headphones daily as they are more comfortable than the Sonys for long use. But if I need studio headphones, I put the Sonys on...These headphones are very durable. I have had them yanked off my head several times due to the short cord, even breaking the plug converter off in my mixer... LOL! My chair is always running over the cord due to the cord not being coiled like the Sonys. If these had a longer cord that was coiled, I would give 5 stars.
!###Pros: outstanding sound, rock solid depth, presence and detail, everything you expect from AKG.  Nice long cord that can be disconnected from the headset.  Excellent overall quality build and design.  Outstanding quality and sound for the price.Cons: head strap has a bit of a plastic feel to it, which can be sticky and uncomfortable on bald heads (like mine).  The self-adjusting feature is a bit tight and tends to put a bit too much pressure on the top of the head.  This might loosen up over time though.  Also the ear cups are round and can be a bit uncomfortable for those with large (non-round) ears.  Other users may not have these issues.  These are very large cans, which might illicit some remarks or teasing in public settings, like at work.Overall you can't go wrong for the price.  A fine upgrade from the cheap headphones provided with most portable devices.  I use mine with a 4th generation iPod and it works great.  Might benefit from a headphone amp in certain situations, but has worked well with everything I've plugged it into.  Thanks Amazon!                    Excellent sound and quality, and they are very comfortable. They are not loud if you have them plugged into a phone or other mp3 player, but they really are really nice. I couldn't imagine what more I could hear from more expensive headphones.                    Awesome frequency and dynamic range for someone looking for a good quality bargain!  They are also extremely sleek and stylish.                    These headphones were my first good pair of full-size headphones, but I've owned the Shure SE215 IEMs for a long time now. Wow! These headphones sound incredible across the entire frequency spectrum, frequently exposing new details in songs I've heard a hundred times. Also, the open-back design does allow for a very large soundstage. As someone who is used to noise-cancelling IEMs, this was an adjustment, but a worthwhile one. I have to say though, if you truly want to hear the full value of these cans, use them with a DAC like the Fiio E07K.I just got one about a week ago, and it just multiplies all of the incredible characteristics of these headphones. In conclusion, these headphones are a VERY worthwhile investment and will change the way you hear your favorite songs. Happy shopping!                    Fantastic cans for all kinds of listening. These were my third pair of over ear phones, and I'm much more satisfied with these AKG's than with my previous pair costing twice as much.                    These headphones are great. The cans are large enough to fit around your ear and the headband fits real nicely. Every layer of sound that comes through is crisp and vivid. It's obviously not the best pair of headphones that you can find, but I personally think that these AKG K 240s are the best pair of headphones in their price range. And that opinions coming after having pairs of Sony, Sennheiser, and Panasonic phones from around the same price.                    After much Amazon comparison shopping, I chose these headphones due to the reviews--and I'm glad I did. The sound is natural, and while the bass is not pronounced, I like hearing music as it was recorded. They are extremely comfortable; I can leave them on for hours with no problems. They seem to be made well of good materials. Highly recommend!                    I'm just a novice but i know these phones are great. I've had mine for about 3 years. crank my amp up 6-8 and the phones are clear as a bell.  Unscrew the Gold Plated jack and you are good to go with smaller devices, although, with my samsung phone wasn't anything like the amp hookup.                    Quality stuff. Had a friend who had a pair of AKGs from the 70s, and they still sounded amazing. I was sold.                    So far I am very impressed by these headphones Ive got sennheisers and beats and these are better than the beats and as good if not better than the sennheisers. The round shape and leather pads are ideal for comfort and the auto adjust headband gives it that nice retro look. if youve got some money to drop definintaly check these out!
!###I've had some cheaper pairs of sennheisers and cheap in ear headphones; but nothing that sounds as great and are as comfortable as these. Crazy thing about them, I'll be listening to songs I've heard hundreds of times, but pick up talking or other sounds I hadn't picked up before in the background, freaking me out thinking someone is trying to get my attention outside my door.Basically,Comfort 4.9/5 - I tried out some bose headphones at cosco that felt like I was wearing nothing, but who knows what a couple hours would have felt like. I've worn these a couple hours at a time and even at the end of those hours, my cumbersome head and large ears felt fine.Sound 5/5 - I'm not a professional in the music industry, but for my needs, listening to music, watching movies, etc... these are above and beyond what I was looking for.                    This Profesional Headphones are great, don't belive it?, try it. I'm making music the whole day using it. it is a great headphone.                    These are great......I just decided to get some new headphones, my Grado SR-60s were falling apart. I made a great choice, these headphones are clear, the music feels up front-without being overwhelming.  I can tell that these would make great headphones for mixing, as you really have a sense of the spatial placement of sounds when you listen to music with these. Not to mention the fact that they're really comfortable, I barely even notice them. I don't think you'll find better sounding headphones for under 100$.                    I'm really enjoying these headphones. I'm very happy with the purchase.1) comfort - good for long home/work wear, not meant for activity. ear cup comfort lasts long over time. you'll take them off due to sweat long before taking them off due to pain.2) mids/highs - they strive for higher crisps, but fall decidedly short. definitely not the brightest... however they have very very low &#34;harsh&#34; quality to them. they are almost completely lacking in the distracting tins. so what you end up with is an acceptable warm sound even it if is a little foggy/hollow.3) honesty - 72%4) ear fatigue - one of the lowest ear fatiguing headsets i've ever worn. actually they may be the BEST.5) bass - kinda poor here. the overall sound quality combined with low fatigue make up (to me) what theses lack in bass. who really wants heavy bass in earphones anyways? a-holes, that's who.6) aesthetics/design - nice modern classics. kinda rad in an electric kind of way. i wouldn't be embarrassed to be photographed wearing them. the cable connects to the head set via a plug which means you can easily replace the cable without cracking open the cups. this is awesome if you've ever lost a pair of phones with much life to give simply because a 5¢ cable gave out.7) purpose - they work great in general. that is, no one music genera sounded better than another. they did decently with TV and gaming as well. strong female vocals will be the most noticeable place they reveal their limitations.8) value - for $85 you can't ask for much more. if you are coming off a pair of $40 crap phones from Target, these should sound light years ahead of what you are used to. If you are an audiophile you might want to aim a little higher.                    Paid a decent amount for these headphones about 2 years ago. Didn't use them much when I first bought them, but I began using them at work. Within a month, the left speaker stopped working. Three weeks later, the other one stopped working. All I'm doing is listening to quiet music on my iPod so I have no idea why the headphones failed so horribly.                    Despite the size, these headphones aren't too heavy and are comfortable to wear. Good quality sound and it continues to last years after buying.                    When my Dad first brought these home from a co-worker who had left the company, I didn't like them. The sound was flat, and I couldn't get over the fact that the bass had been reduced so much compared to the headphones that I had been using earlier. I lost the other headphones a few weeks later and began to use these. When I did find those headphones again, I couldn't believe I had been listening to them for so long. I never knew that I had been using headphones that exaggerated sounds so much. I don't think I could ever go back. The only problem I have with these headphones is the fact that I can't take them outside, they are terrible at blocking out ambient noise. Can't hear them on public buses and cars with loud engines, and turning up the volume will only hurt your ears. All in all, these are excellent for indoor use, I couldn't think of any others at this price that would do the job that these do.                    The only comparable cans (same price range) I've owned are a set of Grado SR-60s, So I will compare to those. I use them solely with my laptop, and find no appreciable difference between the SR-80s and my SR-60s.Firstly, these K240s have a wider stage than the Grados, and clearer midrange. I'm not a thumphead, so that works for me. 20 hours of burn-in subdued the initial high-range harshness beautifully (I started Itunes at song-1, placed these headphones in a drawer, and let them "listen" for 20 hrs). I prefer symphony-like bass, for lack of a better description, and lightly adjusting my Itunes or Windows 7 EQ brings it out sufficiently for me.Those who say the Grados are painfully uncomfortable don't realize that you can CAREFULLY bend them out to a relaxed fit (I say carefully because once you've done so, you cannot bend them back without risk of breakage). Even so, the K240 is far more comfortable - amazingly so.I am disappointed in the lack of power in these K240s. I'm running a Little Dot MK-II 4-tube headphone amp, and with all volumes on maximum I'm not consistently reaching volume levels that I should (some yes, most no). There again, my music source is a late-model laptop with SRS "Premium" sound (for what that's worth).I am also concerned about the future of this thin K240 cord compared to the beefy one on my Grados.PROS:ComfortWide sound stageClarityCONS:Lack of power with laptopThin cordAll things considered, you'll be hard-pressed to find better quality for under $100, probably even $150.                    I've been using these for the past 2 months, they're extremely comfortable and sound absolutely stunning compared to everything I've owned before them. Before these I had a pair of skullcandy hesh, but after I realized skullcandy was horrible I decided on these. I do not regret my purchase, 5/5
!###Got them as a gift for my father and he loves them. They provide awesome sound for the price, and look quite stylish as well.                    I trust these headphones and will replace or repair them if they are ever damaged.  I am also curious about the Quincy Jones AKG headphones -- If Quincy puts his name on them, they've got to meet his standards.  So, several AKG K 240 headphones and some closed-back AKG phones for certain applications and one set of Quincy Jones headphones would be my next Bday wish.                    These are pretty flat, could be bassier - but these aren't your everyday consumer headphones for iPod consumption. They've got huge comfortable ear cups. I loved my first pair so much, I bought another. Comfort of these far surpasses any on-ear headphones. No discomfort from long listening sessions, or tracking. Works great as a guitarist because you can hear the amp through the semi-open cans. Yes you could monitor the guitar tracks, but it just doesn't replicate the same feel of playing, if you track in the same room. Vocal tracking is the same way, a greater sense of the room with open cans.If you're like me, and your left ear cuts out a lot and did some Googling for answers, you found these have a notorious problem (after prolonged use over the years) where the soldering in the left cup can lift. Random cut outs are quite annoying, especially after dropping retail years ago to buy these brand new. No amount of rotating, jiggling, or bending will get it to stay for the remainder of the listening session. So I contacted AKG support, and they said it would be $65 to ship/repair. At that point I placed an order for these (sold for $82.50 at the time) and fixed my other pair by re-soldering the wires. A bit of handy-work and now I have two pairs that work famously.These are such a great sub-$100 buy for anybody who wants to wrap music around your head.                    I'm not that old, but i knew good quality when i was a kid. i bought a pair of Austrian made in my early teens. After 20 years the headband wore down and cracked, so it was time for a new pair. These came in and sound just as good as my 25 year old pair of Austrians (even though these are made in china). If you want and insanely good sounding set of cans for (well) under $100, this is a sure bet. Some pairs are still made in Austria, so check your box. You may get lucky. Lastly, lots of reviews talk about items moving around in the packaging, but mine was packed, all in place.                    An absolutely unbeatable quality-price ratio. Really nice price and really good sound - very natural, with accurate response for all frequencies; Warm and live bass without any trace of the &#34;anabolic-steroid-like&#34; bass, produced by cans like &#34;Beats&#34; or &#34;V-Moda.&#34; Great sound stage. Perfect for classical music, jazz, progressive and alternative rock. Can't say anything about genres like heavy metal or rap, because I am severely allerged to that staff :). However, good old hard rock (Nazareth, Deep Purple etc.) sounds very good.Comfortable, light-weight - and impressive, as far as the design goes. You meet a person in these cans on a street and you immediately understand, that this person takes music seriously :) At least I flatter myself thinking people have this impression when they see me :)                    The perfect combination of quality and price.The product arrived to the destination as it has been suggested (in a relatively short wait period).Great headphones for home and pro. recording studios.Very clear sound ...Of course I will advise all my friends involved music production.                    They are worth having any I'm amazed they sound very good  I recommend  anybody to buy them for that price                    I don't have a lot of experience with studio headphones so I don't have much to compare these with. But they are comfortable and the dynamic range I can hear while wearing them is better then anything else I own, headphones and otherwise.                    These have terrific quality.  That said, the open style is something to get used to, and I probably wouldn't recommend them as your only pair of headphones.  I live in New York City.  When I'm outside, I have to crank the volume up most of the way, and when a subway is coming I just can't hear anything.Oh, and when you're at home, sometimes other people hear things you don't intend them to hear.  Open goes both ways.                    They sound so great. It's like you can reach out and touch the instrument's. I would recommend them to all music lovers.I was a little skeptic at first be that AKG is made in chine now. but I am impressed. they did a hella good job.So let It be said AKG you rock.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!###I, like many others it seems, like the comfort. I thought my first stereo headphones, purchased way back when, were great because they blocked all outside sound; but they were very heavy. I selected these in part because they were light and because they did not have a 'closed-in' feeling; my preference is the 'open' sound as from speakers while avoiding the issue of room acoustics. My home recording studio is very small and even with acoustic treatment, good EQ and great monitors, these headphones still fill a necessary spot. The only downside is they are not super rugged construction. That said, I'd rather have great sound, light-weight and comfort as I'm not planning to just 'toss them around' so they should last forever.                    These are my first pair of AKGs and let me tell you, I'm super impressed. These are by far the most enjoyable headphones to listen to. If you're looking for crazy bumping bass, go somewhere else. These, when properly amped, are incredible, and for 100 bucks, you cant go wrong. The only issue is I have a hard seeing myself using these at school or out of the home. They are quite big, but sound awesome. Very clear, defined bass, mids and trebs are near perfect. My music is very expansive all the way from indie, to dubstep, to big band. These are perfect for me! Definitely  recommend.                    These headphones are a great deal- strong but not overpowering bass (unless EQ'd), very responsive mids and sparkly highs. But the thing that matters most for me is that you get excellent separation and clarity with a pair of midrange cost headphones. I listen to everything from Bach to Minor Threat and these, along with a new non-apple music player, have provided excellent sound. I've actually noticed things in songs I love that I'd not been able to hear before. These headphones are also very comfortable and surprisingly light for their size. I am now an AKG fan.                    I was looking for a pair of headphones with a decent balanced EQ for doing some home recording. Nothing professional just amateur stuff, mostly in regards to making some beats using a MIDI controller. These things sound fantastic. As some of you might know, studio headphones can easily cost $300 up to $3,000. Now I'm sure the pros out there will definitely notice a difference between these kinds of things. But these are perfect for those who are recording at home and who are on a budget. The detachable cable is great. If you ever need to buy a new one, they run about $15 or so. Beats buying a new pair of headphones if the cable ever shorts out. Nice and long cable too. The bass sound on these is perfect. Some headphones have overwhelming bass which makes it nearly impossible to mix down a song, but these are perfect. You shouldn't really be mixing music on headphones as everyone says, but if you have no choice because you don't want to wake up your neighbors, this is the way to go. I could definitely see these being useful for musicians to play along with a click track in a more pro environment as well. Enjoy these puppies. Best in their class I'd say.                    relatively flat, super comfortable, and a bargain at around $100. plus, the cord is detachable, should it fail. all around, a great product.                    When I first tried these I was disappointed.  The midrange and highs were too harsh and tinty to a point where it was unpleasant to listen to music. After reading a couple of posts that mentioned a breakin period was needed before the AKG K240 comes into it's own, I tried it.  I plugged in the headphones to my AVR and played music through them for 19 hours.  After coming home from work to see what they sounded like...well...wow!!  What a difference.  The mid and upper are now smooth and easy to listen to.  These aren't bass thumping headphones, but they sound warm, pleasant, clear, and natural.  You can enjoy listening for hours and not be fatigued.  A great sub $100 headphone.                    My dad purchased the exact same product & model over thirty years ago (yes 30 years)& payed much more for them back then. They have been heavily used and still work only that hardware is falling apart. They have been a great value.They are nice that you are able to listen to quality content and still are able to easily hear from others around who want your attention.Good choice for those who want excellent and wide sound range. They are as good as the positive reviews reported.                    AKG K240's Awsome! I am very happy,they give a rich natural sound reproduction.It seems like the sound is all around you not just in each ear these are studio quality, I wore the first version a similar pair back in the 80's forON AIR work, these sound better than back then.These Cans Feel very comfortable and for extended use aswell they are light on your ears and seem to breath my ears don't sweat when I wear them.I couldn't be more happy you will be too.                    I don't think that you can purchase a better set of headphones for the money, although, I think these are being replaced by the 240MKII's, which interestingly has the same specs as the 240Studio.  These are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time and are very lightweight.  I also use the Shure 440's closed headphones, which is an awesome set of headphones, but become uncomfortable after using them after a short while.  All in all, I have become to like AKG for their "open" sound, and I have found that the bass, which is always coming scrutiny, and the basis of complaints, is rather firm and nicely portrayed, not "boomy" by any means.  I use the AKG 240Studio's everyday for hours at a time and find them great in every way.                    If you are after that "thump-thump" kind of exaggerated sound don't buy these. The K240 headphones are "accurate" and don't add anything to the sound.  People who are mixing or editing sound prefer "accurate" but many music listeners prefer the accentuated bass.  These headphones let you hear what is on the track an add nothing to that.  The sound is transparent, as if you were not wearing headphones.  Also being "semi-open" this means they do not block sound in either direction.  This open design adds to the not-wearing-headphones sound but is not practical in some settings.  Remember these are STUDIO headphones.  They provide accurate sound for engineers and are best used in a quiet studio setting.  If you are a music listener at home then the best use of these headphones is for classical or jazz in a quiet living room.  or for critical listening to any music, for example recently I was trying to listen to Paul McCarney's bass guitar lines in some new and old recordings. With these I can hear every note and also how he played the strings with his fingers.  The K240 provide an accurate, reserved sound for that kind of listening, not the popular flashy and thumpy sound.Serious headphone users will find they need several pair but one pair should be these.
!###Besides these headphones I also own a pair of Sony MDR-7506's so I may make some comparisons in this review. Being a producer of electronic music, I need a pair of headphones that are accurate. These headphones are some of the best I've heard as far as accuracy. Compared to the MDR-7506's these headphones sound a bit duller but only because they do not exaggerate the highs like the Sony's do. They are open so anyone used to big booming bass (which is never good anyway) will be disappointed at first. Do not buy these headphones if you plan to listen to low-quality music through them, they will sound horrible.                    I have been using AKG headphones since the mid 70's when I started seeing them on the heads of every entertainer in the recording studio environment in film and television.  This said volumes to me about the acceptance by the real professionals. Bought my first pair back then and have had them over the years, occassionally upgrading to newest technology model. I happened to be in the discotheque business back then and I bought AKG's for DJ use in all six of our clubs throughout the country. These are fantastic with full range of natural sound from lows to highs. Does not color the sound and they really kick if you loop them through EQ. Ain't nothin' better. I am so spoiled that sometimes I prefer listening to concert DVD's with these on rather than listening "full room" with my very expensive and well appointed home component audio system. And I occassionally go back to my original set of AKG's purchased in 1976 and they still sound awesome, although the rubber ear pads have become rather hardened and I cant wear them for long. My only complaint about this new pair of "around the ear" phones is that you tend to sweat a bit after wearing them through a movie. I also have a set of fairly recent model 141's that are the "on the ear" smaller pad model with very soft foam pads and I must say that I probably prefer them to the full ear enclosure, for that reason. Other than that, you can't beat the undisputed champ in headphone sound, and at an amazing price point for the quality of the sound.                    the  photo I saw was a item Made in Austria, the one I got was made in china and the quality is not the same.the seller said he would refund a return and that  this  model is not made in Austria  anymore.Seller Good , product BAD.                    These headphones are extremely comfterable after hours of use, even if you wear glasses like I do. After watching movies for 5 hours, I forget I even have them on.Another big thing I was worried about with the semi-open design was that it might leak out to much sound, and be annoying to my roomates. In a small, quiet room, if I turn them up really loud, my roomates can hear them a little. But with "normal" listening volume, they did not hear anything! This is great for people who don't want to disturb anyone.The sound is realy something you fall in love with the more you listen to them. The quality is so clear, I can now hear parts of songs I never knew exsisted! Listening to orchastrel pieces, it really comes alive as I can now hear every finite detail of complecated pieces. Intially I thought the bass was lacking, but I find it is actually just more true to what it really sounds like. I actually find using a flat EQ produces the best sound, but if you like more bass, just change your EQ to bassbosster and it will provide very clear, strong bass.They only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating was because when I first got them the left side wasn't working. I played around with it a little, and it started to work again, but I'm afraid it could be a problem in the future. So far this has not been the case, but many people seem to have this problem, so I would use care with the phones.Overall they are the perfect headphone, and highly recomended.                    These sound really good. Good warm tones with just the right amount of bass. Sounds very well balanced in all respects. They are comfortable. They seem a little big for me because they dont fit snug on my adult head. They are no longer made in Austria as the picture would lead you to believe. That might not mean much but these phones were in the running with a few other great phones and where they were made was the tie breaker for me. Finding a made in china sticker on them was dissapointing. But so far so good.                    AKG K240's are semi-open, so many people don't use them in broadcast applications, because feedback can be a problem if you get near a "live" microphone.  I do use K-240's for radio, and don't have the feedback issue, since I don't keep my headphone volume cranked up to super-high levels.  The sound and build quality are top-notch, and the comfort provided by AKG's self-adjusting headband has to be experienced to be appreciated.  I highly recommend these headphones.                    I was using a pair of Alessandro MS-1's hooked into my Sony Walkman 16gb and thought the sound was unbelievable, until I got a Hifiman HM601 slim and hooked up a pair of these cans (after doing some research). Let me say, OMG!!! With a freq. range of 15 to 25 kHz, and for the $ (a big issue), why would you pay more for a better headphone. The sound on these no matter what you may listen to from Classical to Rock A to Z you will not find (if you can find them, they are discontinued) is out of this world. I highly recommend these if not the newer version K240 MKii's. If you really want to spend the $$ get the Quincy Jones series Q701's for $250 to 300 usd. You will not be disappointed I promise you, unless you have the hearing of a dog, you will hear everything the original recording artist wanted you to hear. As one reviewer said "you will learn to hate your speakers after hearing these." I have a HTR with Polk Audio TSi200's ect. and let me just say I find myself listening to the AKG's more often than the Polk's. These Headphones come highly recommended not just from me (a newbie in the world of highend headphones and sound) but from others, just do some research for yourself, you will not bet disappointed.                    I was an audiophile in the past. Now, interested in doing. I wanted to hear recordings accurately. Went with these based on review and reputation. I'm very happy I did. These are excellent, outstanding, accurate. Every bit of praise from others is correct. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.                    I've been looking for a decent pair of headphones for some time now. All I can say is that these were a fantastic acquisition.Pros:-Sound quality is top notch. I always test headphones out against high fidelity french horn recordings and these did a fantastic job. While it is hard to match a full range speaker, these headphones do a swell job with only the faintest of distortion on the most resonant selections in my library. The highs are crystal clear and the bass are plenty punch and wonderful low level response. I can go from Lady Gaga to Aerosmith to Trace Akins to John Williams without thinking twice. These headphones sound great no matter your taste. The only question is if you like the sound of 1/2 open back headphones as opposed to noise isolation.Personally I like being able to hear things going on around me when I want to without having to have my music almost completely off. That said, these speakers can certainly put out plenty of volume where outside noise is not an issue.-They are incredibly light weight. This seems to a function of them being 1/2 open back. It is also a function of the head pad's design. You really don't feel them on you head at all. They are also self adjusting.-The Removable cable is wonderful feature. The clip design seems more reliable than sure and less likely to break the headphones should something yank it out.Additionally, the cable is a miniXLR to 1/8" standard headphone with a screw on adapter to 1/4". The screw treads on the cord can get in the way some headphone jacks on some ipod cases. However these headphones are more likely to be paired with a computer or mixing set up so this is generally not a problem. Depending on how you plan on using the headphones you will either love or hate the 10 foot cable. There is an optional curly 16 foot cable that is about 3-4 feet long when not stretched out.Cons: Non of the below are serious concerns just possible items to be aware of for personal preference-Depending on your preference the cord length-Depending on you use the threads for the 1/4" adapter-They can get a little warm, but they are completely over the ear headphones so that is kind of expected. However that could just me. Non the less it is not enough to bother me or keep me from listening to them for hours and hours.-No the easiest to transport, but then again if you are looking at them you probably don't plan on doing it that much with them.Other thoughts:I would have gotten the AKG K272HD but they were not in stock where I got these. If you are stuck between these and any other AKG headphones, these will certainly not disappoint. At their price point, they can't be beat. Bose have nothing on them and Sure was just too in your face sounding. They also have a wonderful warranty.As of this writing, Amazon has them for $100, I paid more at a local audio shop.                    i have had these for less than 3 months, and yesterday they seemed to have blown out. i can hear instruments and bass and some instrumentals, but vocals or voices in movies in videos are barely audible. Seems like these headphones should have lasted quite a bit longer, and they don't have anyway of contacting them for a replacement. The music i was listening to when i first noticed this issue was not even particularly loud and i was not using a headphone amp so i don't see how this could have happened.
!###Good product love it not much else to say it delivers real sound by that I mean it does add any extra highs, mids, or lows.. If I had to I would purchase this product again.                    Super comfortable.  I forget these are on, as opposed to my Sony MDR-7506's.  I can wear them all day before I feel any ear fatigue.  Very wide stereo image.  On a good mix you can really hear the blend of frequencies, even the low's (kick) will jump out at you and the high are not overpowering, just pleasant.  If you mix in these, you will notice that some things are hard to eq or compress, but other than that they are great and really help you space out your mix.                    This were purchased for my son who uses headphones all the time.  He says they are great and just what he wanted                    Sound quality is pretty impressive for the cost.  Decent, ergonomically speaking.  I got them on sale and they were quite a bargain.                    Solid quality sound, very comfortable, and decent noise blocking. I listen to a lot of metal, punk so I base my sound judgement on that.                    Not as great as I thought they'd be but they're definitely worth the price. Sound quality is good and I love how it easily fits on anyone's head. I do not recommend this for anyone looking to get workout headphones though, as these are studio and will make your ears sweat like crazy if you workout in them. I am completely satisfied with these headphones.                    I think if you have a enough power player (will be more powerful than a laptop )And if you can spend enough long time on burning in your headphone (several weeks)This will be a very good one for you.                    I want to start off that with saying that these are the first headphones I've gotten that are actually audiophile headphones, and not a headset or something cheap. For the first time ever I feel like I hear details in music I never noticed before. The clarity is amazing, the bass levels are perfect and never overrides the mids or highs. This is also the first time I can legitimately hear a soundstage and it's really amazing. Music sounds around the the ear then directly in the ear. I've never heard music like this before in my life and I hope these things last me years upon years.Also gamers, yes these pair of headphones work just fine. I play blacklight retribution, bad company 2, and WoW mostly and with use of the asus xonar u3 (yes that has enough juice to run it at full driver power) you do get a legitimate surround sound feeling and you will be able to tell where things are just fine. However if you have your mind set on the ATH-AD700 then go for that but I want to make this clear again. I could hear footsteps quite fine and got the jump on plenty of people in my tests. These work just fine for games. If you can't hear someone coming up to you, then it's the sound engine or an audio setting you have not setup properly and not the headphone's fault.Update July 2013: I have came across a good vintage stereo amp at an estate sale, a fisher ca-229 to be exact. Upon hooking it up with my computer and that U3 and using that I noticed that these headphones opened up even more (width as well as a very solid sensation of what's in front and behind me, as the artist intended) and sounds less confined compared to just using the xonar U3 to power the headphones. I see why people say now this headphone really needs an amp. It's truly a pleasant experience to hear these cans now and I do not think I will ever regret this purchase, they are just amazing at this price range.                    My son said these were the best headphones he has ever had.  Crystal clear sound and good price for the great quality.                    This is exactly what I was expecting to receive and completely in good conditions.Works perfect with my computer and sounds great!
!###I used to wear these in the studio back in the early 90's. I have been wearing the Sony V-900's since about 97 but on a whim decided to try these again. Love them!                    The sound quality was simply amazing and it was comfortable as heck. I would recommend this to anyone who listens to quite a bit of music. Can't find any problems at all with it!                    This item is really suitable for people who are interested in jazz and rock music because its typical performance.It's worth to own                    Bought it 3 months ago and so far had no problems with it, good quality material.The sound is very clear, has nice balance between highs and lows.It doesn't isolates external sounds as much as I wanted to, but for using it at home and at work (listening to music and watching movies) is a good product. I bought it because I have two musician friends who use it at their home studios, I tried it at their studios and love it, thats why I bought it.So far, no complains. However, I must say I'm not an expert, neither a musician, or DJ, or whatever. On the other hand, sound is great and materials used are good.                    Okay, I'm a little bias for AKG.  I already have the AKG Q701, which I use daily and for hours at a time.  The sound is good, but not as good as the Q701, but then I wouldn't expect it to.  These are semi-open, so it's not going to completely block the outside noise, or keep your music from leaking.  The bass is shy and the highs rather harsh, but its still a good entry level headphone for less than $100.                    Simply the best !!! Excelent Sound !!! Very comfortable !!! and there not heavy on the head !!!! most headphones after a few hours in studio work are heavy in the head, but this beautie is great !!!                    This is my first of AKG headphones after owning Grado, Sennheiser, Audio Technica, Pioneer and Ultrasone. And I am impressed! The build quality and sound makes puts this in the same league as the very popular and highly regarded Grado Prestige Series SR80i Stereo Headphone. Right out of the box these sound wonderful with no sharp treble or muddy mids issues. I own the older version of the SR80i and these AKGs are better built and just as comfortable or even more so. You want to hear all the music you are missing with iBuds or cheap headphones? These would be a great first step into better sounding headphones.                    I've been using these headphones for 40 hours a week over the last 4.5 years.  Simply put, they're amazing!  I wear them during the day while working, as ambient noises greatly disturb my train of thought.  Prior to purchasing these I was cycling through cheaper headphones every 6 months or so. Usually they would physically break or the wiring would go bad.At some point I had enough, and decided that maybe it was worth the extra money to just buy a single pair of headphones and make them last.  After talking to a few audio and music enthusiasts, I was pointed to the AKG 240's.  I haven't regretted it for a second!  They're light, comfortable, sturdy, and the audio quality is excellent.  Even better, you can purchase replacement ear pads (which I recently did and it made the headphones feel new again) and wire.  It's cheaper in the long run to buy these rather than cycling through $40 cheapies every 6 months.Buy these you won't be sorry.                    Excellent response to broad frequency range.  Very comfortable for children and adults.  Excellent value for the cost.  Durable for frequent use.                    I've been using these headphones for about a year and a half in my home recording studio and they have been simply AMAZING. They have a big, rich sound with a deep deep. For the price they have a pretty good &#34;neutral&#34; sound to do mixing. The grills are comfortable enough that I can stay in my studio all night and practically forget that I'm wearing these. For the quality and the price, these are great for musicians or recording artists without busting your wallet.If performance wasn't good enough... their warranty is! These babies come with a 2-year warranty and I got to test this out recently when the left speaker suddenly quit working. I sent it out for warranty repair and received it 3 weeks later... good as new! They had replaced certain parts and reassembled the body. Now THAT'S a company that stands behind their products!
!###The closest thing to good headphones I've ever had in the past were low-end Sennheiser noise-cancelling headphones. Switching to these headphones has made music and entertainment so much more enjoyable, and I mean MUCH more. They were recommended to me by a friend because of the quality design and low price. This was definitely a good starting point for me, as beginner/wannabe audiophile. I also have a headphone amp which improves them further.                    As a radio DJ this is only my 3rd aka 240 in 25 years of nearly daily use. They are still as comfortable as ever and after one week of breaking in sound nearly flawless.                    These are very comfortable, even for one with glasses like myself, and have good sound reproduction for its price range. A definite recommendation.                    These headphones are very articulate at pretty much every frequency. One thing some people should consider is if they want open back headphones, which allow ambient sounds in and out, so it's not the loudest of headphones available. The pros for these open backs is that you don't have to remove your headphones every time you collaborate with someone. Personally I like the sound of open back headphones better than closed because it sounds a little crisper in my opinion.                    there made very well and worth every penny if your looking for a everyday or studio headphone i reccomend these                    First, let me say that the pair of AKG K-240s that I recently purchased are replacing a pair I'd had for several years that were accidentally broken. I learned the hard way that they are (like many things) not dog proof!!Anyway, when not encouraging canine misbehavior, I've been engineering and producing music for more than 20 years. As someone who has spent countless hours having to wear the 'tools of the trade' I can honestly say that these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned . Virtually no discomfort even after 4 hours of continuous wear with the AKG K-240s. For anyone who has experienced ear fatigue and pain because of long recording or mixing sessions this is a huge plus.In addition the sound quality is terrific. A nicely balanced flat response all along the frequency range. Good transparency. Probably as close to near field monitors as headphones get in this price range. What you hear is what is on the track. Would I feel comfortable mixing an album with these phones? I've done it and loved the results.The only limitation with them is that they are semi-open which allows for some sound bleed. If you are a vocalist or an instrumentalist who will be micing their instrument and adding a track to a mix then you might want to use a pair of 'closed' phones to eliminate monitor feed leaking into your track. Also if you are doing a live recording in a very noisy environment the AKG K-240s might not give you enough sound isolation to be ideal.However, In the engineer's chair in the studio or for serious recreational listening for extended periods of time the AKG K-240 phones are, in my opinion, an unbeatable value.                    These headphones sound amazing but an iPhone 4s cannot adequately power them. I had the music turned up to full blast and it wasn't very loud. These headphones shine when you plug them into an amplified source, however.The cord is also really long, which is not great for mobile use.Still a great product.                    So far they have had great sound. One thing to note to get the best sound out of them you need to burn (Run sound through the headphones for more then 20 hours) them in.                    Bought these headphones for 60$ after remembering a review on G4 tv.  This product is amazing (especially the bass)  and does not cost a lot, what more could you want?                    I have to mix my own songs and I hate using any other headphones.Their balance is great! and comfortable Too!
!###These worked really well for the podcast requirements that I have.  I'm not an audiophile or audiogeek, so bought these on a recommendation.  Not disappointed.                    very good.It's a very high ratio of the headphones, I like it very much, and recommend it to my friends.Alt, alto, bass is balance, sound clean.                    A couple of factors make these headphones particularly attractive:1) Excellent sound quality2) A replaceable cable, which means that unlike most headphones whose cables wear out after a few years and must be replaced, these should have a longer lifetime3) A good price.  These used to be at least twice as expensive, but are cheap on Amazon for some reason.  Perhaps it's because the production moved from Austria to China.Note that as mentioned above, the headphones are open, so they don't block sound.  This makes them more comfortable (although my ears still get a little too warm after wearing them for 15 minutes).                    I'm a first-time K-240 user and I was totally blown away by the sound effect of this studio monitor. It produces accurate, crystal clear mids and highs, and its bass is powerful yet non-distorted. The headphones wear really comfortable and the workmanship is great. The only drawback would be the less desire to wear them outdoors due to their considerable size.                    There are many reviews here. Great headphones, the sound is amazing for the price, I really enjoy the music, but for movies I prefer closed cones.                    Great sound, great design. Why the hell is there a word limit. Awesome sounding headphones, however they leak a bit too much, but the sound quality is good. Not amazing bass response.                    I have used the older K240 headphones for years and they are workhorses but they need a good bit of juice to sound goo and my iPhone just couldn't drive them properly. These 55 ohms versions work fine with my computer or iPhone as well as my mixing board!                    very good  Studio Headphones.For the price, I haven't heard anything that even comes close to these headphones.good quality.I love it.                    I bought these headphones and I pair them with the fii0 e9. I really like these headphones. I really want to try the AKG q 701 and the sennheiser hd 600 to see how my headphones compare to the higher end headphones.                    I bought these as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves them. He's been looking for some new headphones but he couldn't quite find any that were worth the asking price. We found these shortly after though and he uses them all time. He likes to make little tracks in FL Studio and these are quite nice because they don't throw too much bass at you. You actually hear what you're creating with a fairly great amount of accuracy. Even for non-production purposes, these are nice. They're lightweight, comfortable but certainly durable. Definitely a good buy.
!###I have worked in Radio and occasional music mixing throughout the years. The classic AKG design was found everywhere- radio stations, studios, on location, at home. This model, (at least one of its variants) was a fine sounding, highly respected standard in the industry(ies). Evidently, those models were made in Austria. I was hoping the now much cheaper Chinese version was basically the same except for lower labor costs being passed on, and a couple fewer accessories in the box. Nothing could be further from the truth. These are not an exceptionally good value at $66.00, let alone the $160 suggested. I don't know if they skimped on the drivers, or what's different, but these are cold, analytical, no extension at either extreme, OK midrange, fair soundstage with some detail. But poor dynamic range. They are just no fun for work OR play.  I'm baffled at the great reviews, UNLESS, like I'm thinking, this is a different animal then the model masquerading in the reviews starting sometime in 2011. If you notice, most of the fair to poor reviews were done in 2011 and later. That's when something changed. Look at the various Audio Technica, the cheaper Senns, Sonys,or Grados for under $100. ALL will beat these handily AND get your feet tapping. Use these maybe for shortwave radio?So- my best deduction- something happened on the way to China.....                    Been using these for about a week now and am thoroughly enjoying them.Comfortable, around the ear design means my ears don't hurt after wearing them for prolonged periods. I've been wearing them for almost 2 day straight now, and no problems. The only comfort issue is that the way the soft strap works, it pinches my hair and if I don't take it off correctly it will pull out a bunch of hairs and that hurts. Not a big deal, just a pain the first few times I was taking them on and off.Sound is great, very even through bass, mids, and highs. Been listening to mostly Above & Beyond-esque trance and progressive house through them and it's very satisfactory. Will be producing some electro-house style stuff in a few days.Again, I'll try and update once I've gotten more use out of them.                    You do not need to spend hundred of dollars to get great studio headphones. These are for mixing down in the studio, and are perfect for that. I recommend these for home recording and mixing down.                    First, i wanna start off by saying these headphones are GREAT! Extremely comfortable, VERY crisp sound and the fact that it has an 8ft cord makes it great in the studio. That being said, lemme tell you why i bought these headphones and what the cons are.I'm a music producer, and i bought these so i could produce without driving my neighbors crazy with the constant thumping from my monitors. I was looking for quality headphones that would give me a similar expirience to my monitors, without breaking the bank and after a lot of research i decided these were the best choice for me. but the problem i've noticed with these is that theyre actually TO good. they have the amazing ability to reach extremely high frequency's, and extremely low frequency's, without any distortion in the sound, but the problem with that is, realistically, no normal speaker can handle the frequency's these can. so i would make a track and it would sound GREAT on my headphones, but then i would try the track out on my car or different headphones, and it would sound like garbage and i realized its because, im hearing sounds on my headphones that normal speakers, I.E. car, computer, or other headphones, just wouldnt pick up. so i was constantly having to reference my songs on other sound systems to find out what sounds were/were not being heard on regular systems. so i guess its not a bad thing these headphones pick up just about every frequency you throw at it but it is a bit counter productive having to constantly export my audio just to see how it sounds, when that was the whole point of buying great headphones in the first place right? But all in all, i would definitely recommend these to anyone looking to get some high quality studio headphones but dont wanna break the bank. great headphones for an even better price. just remember when your making music, it may sound like gold on these things, but put that track on any other system, and you might get an unpleasant surprise                    I owned a pair of these AKG headphones in the eighties, which were made in Austria, and they were great in every respect.  Now made in China they are bulkier, cheaper looking and not as comfortable.  I returned them to Amazon and will not bother with the AKG brand anymore.  Sorry to see yet another use to be quality company turn over their manufacturing to the Chinese only to have them dumb it down ...                    My first impression of these headphones was a general improvement in overall sound signature for most music. Without being relentlessly revealing, they still provide an extremely good amount of detail in music you might otherwise never hear. They're large but not unwieldy, contain a fairly long 10 ft. cord, but unfortunately can't be folded up. Portability is probably not the best of the bunch but they will fit nice and snug in your briefcase or backpack if you're a college kid like me. Burning in provides a better bass response over time and it supposedly tightens out with the aid of an amp. (I'm satisfied though) Comfort can be a little exaggerated on some of the reviews here, and while I will say it's very good, I can't honestly vouch for being able to wear these prolonged periods of time without any discomfort. Everyone's ears are different but I find the fake pleather to be an unfortunate choice of material because it causes my ears to sweat. I'm considering buying a pair of velour replacement pads from the manufacturer though so hopefully that will yield some improvement. For 90 to 100 bucks you can't go wrong.                    These are, by far, the most comfortable circumaural headphones I have ever worn for an extended period.  They are super light, weighing in at 8.5 ounces and the band distributes the weight across a large area. I can't even feel them on the top of my head.  There isn't too much pressure on the sides of the head either.  The only complaint I could make is that I would prefer velour pads because the vinyl pads it comes with can get a little bit tacky from sweat and sebum.They are stunningly beautiful as well.  I love the design with the gold rings.  I wouldn't wear them in public though, because circumaural headphones by their nature look dorky.  They also leak sound, being semi-open, but I don't think it will annoy anyone around you as long as you keep the volume at a reasonable level.  You don't have to pump the volume with these cans, because all the details will pop even at low volumes.That brings me to sound quality.  I am not very knowledgeable about sound technology but I have two good ears.  These are the best headphones I have ever owned.  They might sound a little flat to some people because they are used to cheap headphones that pump the mids or bass and flavor the sound.  These aren't reference headphones but they are in that direction.Your enjoyment of these headphones will depend on whether or not your sound system can drive them.  An iPod will struggle without an amp.  I have heard that these are fairly easy to drive though, and my computer does it perfectly well.                    It took me a few weeks to really learn to appreciate these headphones, but now that I can hear the difference between this set of headphones and my old set (a pair of fairly inexpensive Yamaha headphones), the difference is immense.  The detail that they bring out in all types of music breathes new life into even the oldest tune.  These headphones make me wish my car stereo had a headphone jack so that I could listen to all my music through these instead of speakers.I listen to a wide array of genres, as well as record and mix my own music, and I use these for everything.  While they say you shouldn't mix on headphones, I find that these headphones are fairly balanced with only a slight emphasis on middle range frequencies, which gives the music you're listening to more warmth.I shopped around for headphones for a while and finally decided to purchase these because they were reasonably priced compared to much higher end studio headphones and have been happy with my purchase ever since.  (And by the way, given that the headphone's impedance is 55 ohms, you do NOT need a separate amplifier to crank them up.)I HIGHLY recommend these headphones.                    I had a pair of sennheiser hd200 and these outdo in sound quality.  They do not cut out environmental noise, which sort of sucks, and do not come with a curly cord, but their sound quality is quite a lot better.                    I wasn't expecting much when I purchased the K240 Studios.  I was just looking for a good headphone for traveling that was about $100.  And I think I'm getting more than my money's worth with these AKG's.I'm relatively new to the headphone world so I haven't heard a lot of pairs but I know what kind of sound I like as I'm sure we all do.  So here are my impressions of the good and bad of the 240's.The Good-Very pleasing frequency response characteristics.  I'm not a big fan of too much treble and I think the 240's roll of the treble just about perfectly for my taste.  They have a fair bit of detail during dynamic passages but when things get quiet, they won't allow you to pick out every little inflection in the recording.  Mids are very well balanced in my opinion.  They sound very natural throughout the midrange and there are no peaks or valleys that I can hear.  Mids are not as forward as Grados but I still consider the 240's a pretty "lively" pair.  And bass is a pleasant surprise.  They go relatively deep (deeper than a $100 headphone should if you ask me) and the bass is always well-controlled.  I would say there's a bit of a bump in the upper bass but it's not something that's distracting.  Rather, it gives the 240's a "fun" sound that makes them a thoroughly relaxing listen.-Respectable imaging.  After about 50 hours of run time, I find the imaging very good for a headphone in this price range.  they're not the widest- or deepest-sounding cans I've heard but they present individual sounds in a very coherent and pleasing way spatially.  The right source material and amp will definitely make a difference in this respect, too.-Adequately comfortable - The pleather earpads do get a little warm and sticky but I haven't had any gripes about leaving them on for a few hours at a time.  I have a big head so I consider this a pretty positive thing.  I didn't think I'd like the self-adjusting headband for that reason but it's implemented very well and "hugs" the head nicely.  And I should also mention that when I first picked up the box, I thought somebody had forgotten to put a pair of headphones in it.  That's how light they are.The Not So Good-Construction - It's not awful by any means but the earcups in particular seem a bit cheap and the pleather earpads don't look like they're as solidly attached to the cups as they could be.  Neither of these items seem to affect the sound so they're minor gripes but on close inspection, the 240's aren't the most glamorous cans I've ever seen.-Break-in - I've never been much of a break-in proponent until I started getting deeper into higher end headphones.  And with that said, these definitely need some run-in before they relax.  Out of the box, the mids were more than a little shouty and the treble had a grainy quality that I wasn't a big fan of.  Imaging is really one-dimensional for the first several hours, too.  So give them some time and they'll end up sounding much better.-Cord - Again, not awful but I've definitely seen better cords.  The 240's cord just seems too small for such an otherwise substantial can.  I like the single-sided approach with the quick mini-XLR disconnect but the rest of the cord could be a little beefier.That's about it.  All in all, a fantastic can at a great price point.  4 stars for aesthetics and 5 for sound for the money.
!###What can I say?  These are the gold standard in broadcast headphones.  You won't find a better pair of cans at this price.  You probably won't find a better set of headphones at ANY price.  I know that there is the MK II version of these now, but unless someone is going to buy them for you, the K-240 is the only way to go.  Not only are they the best sounding headphones, they are also very comfortable.  If you're a broadcaster or podcaster, you won't be disappointed.  And the price!  You can't beat the price right now!  Buy these before they're gone forever!                    I had never Lou Reed's breathing.I did now. And it's oh so crisp!As soon as I took this out of the box (which says Made in Austria, by the way, meaning auto-awesome), I played "Transformer" and it sounded, well, like it was meant to sound.These are big, but extremely comfortable. They're not "stylish" in the way that some headphones are, but they're great if you plan on wearing them for hours on end, especially when you're mixing stuff.I'm no audiophile, on the contrary, I'm deaf. Just kidding. But these are my first actual studio Headphones; I've recorded my own music for at least 10 years and am quite content with lo-fi equipment, but now I realize having great a great monitor is essential, otherwise it's like getting dressed in the dark and not having a mirror to see how you look.Either way. Buy this thing. It's so cheap for how great it is.                    I've owned AKG 240's since the late 70's and they are fantastic. Very durable as I am just buying my 3rd pair in 30+ years. Use them several times a week. Amazing sound - clear and balanced. I've seen more than one music documentary where the 240's were shown used in the studio(s)- so that should tell you something. I've been in music for over 30 years and really have no use for any other headphones. And the price is outstanding for the quality.                    I've had the AKG 240's and Koss Pro 4AA's.  The AKG phones are lighter and have good sound, but my ears don't fit perfectly in those circular cushions, and they begin to hurt after a while.  The Koss Pro 4AA's have a more elongated space for ears.  (Maybe my ears have gotten bigger as I've progressed through the aging process.)  My personal preference is the sound from the AKG's - they have a better low end than the Pro 4AA's.                    As an amateur radio operator I was looking for a headset that did was of some quality, lightweight, and did not totally isolate me from the other sounds in the room. I have been using a pair of AKG K240 Studio headphones for over a year and find them to be the most comfortable headphones I have ever tried. They are light and the ear pieces cup your ears just enough to keep out ambient noise, but don't smash your ears into the side of your head. After hours of wear, you really can't tell you have them on. The dynamic range and sound reproduction is superb. Yes, they are full range, but they reproduce the human voice and the frequency range for CW (800-2K Hz) perfectly which is what I want in a pair of communication headphones.I can say that after much research the other reviewers were 100% correct.                    I purchased this product (AKG K240) on Amazon for $114 and for the price it's nearly unbeatable. I think it has a very wide, spatial sound stage and I particularly notice the placement of the sound is just were I like it. Every channel of music is separate and distinct. The mids are not as warm as the Sennheiser HD555s I own, but the placement of the sound is much better in my opinion. It's also easier to get a bass response out of these phones with the help of a good headphone amp, since my iaudio U3 is the only mp3 player I own that can drive them low without help (I have other mp3 players that such much better though).The HD555s on the other hand need very strong amplification to even notice much of a low end bass. With proper source amplification though, the K240s are very engaging, fun and offer a wide sound stage and are really good at separating instruments, drums & vocals in any genre of music. They are also very lightweight and you almost forget they're on after a few minutes.They have only a slightly artificial, tinny treble at high frequencies especially when compared to the HD555, but other than that, I think they are better phones for the money. I only wish they were slightly easier to drive at lower volumes.                    I haven't listen to my CDs for a long while.  This 240 really sounds nice and clear.  It's like listening to music with good amplifiers and speakers at the proper level.  The sound is slightly toward the warm side, but with authority on both the highs and lows.  It has excellent imaging, and is well worth the money.  I also bought the AKG271.  They are very much alike.  If you don't need the features of the 271, then 240 is a better buy because of the lower price.  Both were made in Austria.  Very good quality throughout.I am using them with the stereo receiver or the headphone amplifier.  The sound is very nice and no specialized equipment is needed to achieve this level of joyful experience.                    This is a review for recreational use at home.My friend has the Grado Prestige Series SR80 Stereo Headphoneand at first I was going to get those, but comfortability and durability became a concern. Oddly enough these AKG headphones turned out to also be cheaper when taking into account the cost of shipping, for these were free shipping and the Grado's were not. My only concern was that their size would prevent me from ever taking them out of the house, but this was something I could live with.The moment I received them in the mail I was happy that I chose them. They appear to be extremely durable, which is a good thing because I'm always hard on my headphones. They are much more comfortable than the grado's and the sound is equivalent.If you want some headphones to listen to music at home that are comfortable, affordable, and provide you with optimal sound quality, look no further. The only reason I'd ever consider the grado's is because they are smaller and a little bit more portable, but if your looking for headphones on the go earbuds are better.                    I upgraded to these from a pair of AKG K66's which had come with a very strong recommendation from a friend.  Frankly, I was dissatisfied with the 66's for what I considered an overall lack of fidelity, although the bass was decent.  These on the other hand are everything the 66's were not.  They are clear, crisp, incredible.  The 66's were extremely comfortable and I was concerned about these, but those concerns were laid to rest as the K240's feature a similar head-strap with auto-fitting action (never going back to having to adjust headphones to go on my head) and I'd actually consider these more comfortable, as the strap is made from a softer material.  They have a different dynamic than the 66's, less Bass heavy, which actually provides what I'd consider a more natural sound.  I wear them all day every day at work, and I could not be happier.                    These headphones are amazing, the sound feels like it's being played around you, I can hear everything.  When I first saw these headphones, I just wanted to buy them for their looks, they're vary retro. The quality is good as well, the bands around the phones are plastic covered metal, made in Austria, they also are very very comfortable, can wear them for hours, they adjust to any sized head too, have attachable cord, but don't worry, the cord clips and stays on tight, comes with adapter.Technical Specifications - varimotion xxl speakers for ultimate accuracy.  Crisp sound even at high volume levels.High efficiency and wide dynamic range, a good choice for portable use, higher sound pressure levels.Frequency range - 15hz to 25khz, sensitivity (dB/mW, dB/V*)91,104*,  max. input power (mW) 200, 55 ohms.suited for - (SA)CD, DVD(A), DAT, MP3, CD, MD, and PC/laptops.Over all a geat headphone.
!###I have tried many headphones & returned them all . they all lacked one thing "comfort" .Some headphones were just too heavy , you would have to remove them off your head every 5 minutes just to relief the weight on your head . I have tried Ultrasone proline 550 , 650 , Sennheiser hd595 , hd555 .any many more . They don't come close to the AKG K240 . First is "comfort" they are very light in weight , the sound is awesome . I am using creative sound card on my pc , nothing high end . they sound great . By the way the plug in wire on the side is very rugged no worries if you are concerned about that , i think it's better than the screw in type where i have seen people screw them in the wrong way damaging the thread. I recommend 4 hrs of breaking in time just to experience the full spectrum of these headphones .Enjoy                    I don't have high expectations when it comes to headphones or earbuds or anything aside from a floorstanding speaker.Aside from that these sound great, think a amp would make them 10x better though.Good build quality and it looks great.                    These cans are very light and comfortable to wear all day. The sound is very clear and the only limits I have on them are that I don't have a sufficient sound card to really hear them at their best. Hooking these up merely to onboard audio or an Ipod is kinda depressing. The AKG's are a nice step up from my senn 555's The senn's were a lot louder and crashing and the AKG's are more focused and rushing. The AKG's are highly recommended. Five Stars!                    These are really good headphones for the money.  The tonality is flat and uncolored.  Your sound equipment needs to bring your listening experience to your liking.  The headphones just follow suit, and do that extremely well.  I haven't yet heard them clip regardless of listening levels.  I enjoy all manner of music (minus rap and hip hop etc).  These headphones can do them all justice.If there is a con, it is that they will make you sweaty around the ears after a while.The very long cord that it comes with makes it easy for you to move about if you need to.  It also allows me to sit back on the couch and have them plugged into my computer while watching movies and music at sound levels that I enjoy without bothering my wife who has extremely good hearing......If you want earphones that do not color the sound that they are reproducing, and if your equipment supports any need for kicking bass etc, the AKG K 240 delivers!Bernie                    I have owned these since 2007.  They are lightweight and very comfortable.  I have since purchased headphones that cost three times as much and the difference in sound quality is negligible.  These are supremely accurate phones;  they reproduce just what was recorded.  If you are looking for deep bass, for example, you are not going to get it unless deep bass is what was recorded in the first place.  At sub $90, these are an incredible value.                    Bought these, read a few negative reviews about comfort and sound quality, not true. These are very comfortable even for extended wear, the sound quality is excellent. I have an amateur recording studio, I lay down multiple music tracks and then do a voice over recording while listening to the music. I have to hear my voice as I am doing this and these do the trick without contaminating the voice track with the music from the semi open design of the headphones. The price is great. You will love them.                    These headphones get the job done and more.  They're light around your ears and have great balance.  If you like listening to bands, every instrument is audible and clear.  They don't cancel outside noise, which is nice for me living in the city I can hear whats going on around me.  For the price, you can't beat them.                    I bought 2 of these to use in Carifesta IX 2013 in Suriname. (a 10 day Caribbean Culture event)I enjoy the AKG quality and didn't expect less.Now....anyone putting these cans over their ears, give a tump up.They're just GREAT!                    Since the mid-70s, these have been standard equipment in sound studios.  So it is no wonder they sound so great, so accurate across the entire audio spectrum.  You could spend lots more money and not find better headphones.  They are also extremely comfortable.  And at this great price it is a no brainer!  Buy them!                    I got these headphones about 3 years ago, and I've worn them so much that I actually took of the ear pads from my dad's unused old pair of K 240s and put them on here. Although the pads have worn out, the sound hasn't! After 3 years of daily listening, they still sound the same they did when I bought them, and even better! To this day, I still need to find a pair that sounds better in the price range. They sound fuller and have a better soundstage than the ATH-M50s, and they actually sound a lot better than the more expensive AKG K 271s. I'd say these have amazing balance; the bass is perfect, mids are just as they should be, and highs are not piercing but are perfectly blended in to the texture. They sound like they should be much more expensive, so you should get them now before they go up in price!
!###These are by far the clearest, most revealing headphones I have ever worn.  The sound is perfectly engineered to pull out individual instruments, push them to the front when they need to be heard, and then push them to the back when they are quiet.  But even when they are  quiet or buried in the mix, they can still be heard if you know what you're looking for.The bass is not great, and neither is the volume or ambient noise isolation (due to the open ear design), but if you're buying these, you're not looking for cheap, commercial sound.  These are excellent for one thing: sonic clarity.                    Pros:semi-open, means some isolation.excellent sound, especially the mids.great build quality.detachable cableCons:Really need a good amp. to shine.                    I&#8217;m very happy with AKG headphones, this is my second set of AKG headphones they the sound is great!! Thank you.                    The semi open nature of the headphones is nice because I can still hear what is going on around me. The highs are very lush and sparkly and the bass is just right. They are also very comfortable. Highly recommended!                    Great set of phones for those of us who cannot afford the really expensive headphones the serious recording studios use.  I use them in my hobby studio and everyone loves hearing themselves on this rack!  Of course the guy behind the equipment may have something to do with that! LOL                    Previously used the brand before this purchase and decided to upgrade.  Absolutely a great decision and this upgrade purchase was actually better than the price paid here locally for the lesser model.                    great feel, great sound, although i wish they were a little bit louder bass wise everything else works out great!                    I love this, music sounds amazing I'm hearing stuff I didn't even knew was there in some songs, amazing for mixing, which was the reason why I bought them, I can hear every detail of my mix, really really great sound and yes I like the semi-open quality cause I can mix stereo really well.                    These headphones are fantastic and honest. I recommend to anyone looking for a good set of studio headphones that won't break the banks.                    In addition to these (mine are Made in China), I own a ton of other headphones, from $30 to over $300: Sennheiser HD-600, AKG-K501, Sony MDR-V6 and MDR 7506, Etymotic Research ER6, Koss Porta-Pro, cheaper Sonys and Sennheisers. They sound incredibly good, about as good as the best headphones in their price class. Compared to the MDR 7506 (closed headphones, but similarly priced) these AKGs have crisper and more musical highs but the bass lacks a bit... You will get better sound with the HD-600, but IMO the difference in sound quality does not justify the price difference. The AKG-K501 have similar sound, perhaps a tad more refined mids and highs, but lack bass even more. I found them to be fairly easy to drive by portables, but benefit from amplification. They leak sound a lot so you can't use them at work (unless you have an office...). Together with the K501s they are the most comfortable headphones I own. Currently these headphones have replaced the MDR-7506 as the best bang for the buck in my collection.
!###Clear crisp notes dipped in acoustic perfection. Listening to music on the AKG Acoustics Semi-Open Headphones is like falling in love for the first time. You may start to feel breathless as notes wash across soundscapes unveiled in moments of sheer amazement.What beauty these headphones reveal. Every note is placed perfectly in a musical clarity revealing a perfect harmony and depth as sound swells and breaks and takes off in all directions like universes of sound.This is not an exaggeration, but rather an admission of fact. Let's just say that if a friend gave you these, you would love them forever.If headphones can make you feel weak in the knees...these will. The AKG headphones are also surprisingly comfortable and lightweight.~The Rebecca Review                    These headphones are a beacon of mediocrity. They sound ok, however they fit a little loose around the ears, and don't suppress outside sound. I should have just got the Beats Audio's!!! These are not terrible, but officially out-dated.                    If you are looking for a set of headphones that will equal a good set of speakers--these are not those.I had been anxious to try these from positive reviews around the Internet.  Right out of the box, I was sorely disappointed.  They do not sound either bright or rich.  Granted, the sound from deep bass through the upper voice range is quite acceptable, but anything higher often breaks into a crackle and sounds very artificially generated--a lot like the cheapest small speakers you might ever have dealt with.  Real detail?  Forget it!My work is in radio and involves a fair amount of editing and mixing, in addition to on-air announcing.  Because I have never found an acceptable pair of cans for the editing, I much prefer speakers.  But due to the work environment, I often have to don earphones to keep from annoying others.  My actual preference is a set of Philips earbuds I bought while in Europe (not available in the US), the SHE2650.  They're cheap (under the equivalent of US$10 when on sale), have amazing bass response, and excellent clarity and detail when equalized with a linear slope of boost starting around 880khz and ending at +10db at 20khz (add bass boost to taste).Over the years, my observation has been that anybody can fairly quickly adjust to different speakers, headphones, and even varying equalizations, and think they are happy and getting good sound.  Reviewers that say they needed some time to get used to these phones, demonstrate my point.  But in A/B comparisons, these K240S cans do not measure up.  They sound like a sore throat feels--scratchy, not smooth and clear.  Definitely not worth the money to me.  They will be relegated to editing voice only--or more likely, they will never come out of the drawer.  It is a real two-star disappointment for me.                    I wanted the ones made in Austria, I got the ones made in China. I am sending them back. Not what I expected.                    I bought these because I was in need of a pair of good quality headphones, with good longevity, to wear while I study for finals. I paid 93.08 cents after taxes for these. The sound quality is what i expected, but the construction of these feel incredibly cheap. I will be returning them in a few days, and ordering a pair of krk kns-6400 or 8400.                    Very tinny sounding and this is on quality tracks... not mp3's. If you like bass/bass accentuation don't bother. The only music I can really stand hearing with these is classical. Also, they are surprisingly quiet. I am generally sensitive to loudness but I found, even when at their max, to be weak with some tracks. I am surprised at how many positive reviews there are of these headphones. They just don't do it for me. I'm sending them back.                    As a transcriber, these were recommended to me to get crisp, clear sound quality.  I am disappointed that the quality is no better than the earphones I currently use for transcription.
!###These AKG are not new, and they are made in China, but the sound is almos perfect. They are very light and comfortable. The audio details are amazing. The highs are clear, and never sound harshing. The bass may be lacking for some, but that's what happens when you get contamited by all the beats crap that it's out there.I highly recommend using these with a headphone amp.Must buy, no regrets ;)                    I received this as a gift for Christmas after dropping some hints and it has lived up to expectations. Prior to owning this I have gone through the Grado SR-60i, Thinksound MS-01, Akg K271 MkII and the thing they all have in common is that the sound stage isn't very large. The sound quality on all of these are phenomenal but I have always wondered what this soundstage is that people keep mentioning in their reviews across various audio forums. I understand the concept of it and after having all these headphones I just wasn't satisfied since I felt I was missing something in the sound. After finally getting these, I noticed that these are a lot thinner than the K271. The headband suspenders still make them look a bit goofy to wear as a portable but I do so on really cold days since they double nicely as earmuffs. Now getting back to the soundstage, listening to music on this even without a DAC I didn't notice new details that I didn't get from the other headphones but what I really like is how wide the music comes across. I'd almost use the word 3D to describe it since some instruments seem to come from behind you. This is the soundstage everyone has been raving about and I would say these are my favorite pair of headphones to listen to out of the 4 I own. People say that the Grado is better for rock and while I find no flaws with the Grado, I actually find myself enjoying classic rock on these headphones more since it feels like you are listening to music in a large auditorium vs a small room. It doesn't have the nice velour pads or the coiled cable like the K271 but the parts are interchangeable thankfully. I did stick with the leather earpads and find those just as comfortable. I thought with the Semi-Open design, not as much sound would leak out but these leak about as much as the Grados, but like the Grados, I still use these in the library regardless. People would have to be sitting right next to you to have it really be bothersome.-Michael                    I received these headphones yesterday, and coming from Sennheiser 428's, which cost $14 more when I bought them two years ago, these are much better constructed. These have less bass than the Senns, but the bass it does have sounds much clearer and not as muddy. With my old headphones I was always concerned about them snapping on me, but these have a much more comfortable and robust design and construction. The cable is also a good size, and is actually replaceable, which is nice. The replacement is $29 though, almost half of the set of headphones......bleh. Hopefully I won't need them.Anyway, they come with a 10 foot cord, which is nice in my situation with a desktop. I can get up and move around some without having to take them off. I also enjoy the semi-open design of the headphones, I can hear my roommate if he is talking to me without having to take them off. As another note, these do not have the &#34;Made in Austria&#34; decal on the side, yet they do sound good.                    I ordered these headphones as a Christmas present for myself, and they are everything that previous reviews have mentioned. They are very comfortable and have a great sound. The headphones are fairly large but still look goodPros:Accurate mids and highsDecent basscomfortable ear pads (because of the semi-open design, they seem to float on your ears instead of clamp to your head)large head band reduces pressure points on headCons:Bass is a bit muddyEar pads become a bit hot (but nothing bad enough I would take them off)A bit quite (I have read they require an amp to get full sound quality)Interesting sound stage. However I like how they sound so not a problemIn conclusion, these are a very good starter headphone for those who want to upgrade their music listening. They have a &#34;warm&#34; sound to them, which in my opinion makes genres like jazz sound even better. You will not be disappointed with this headphones.                    Very good sound and extremely comfortable. I use these in my studio every day. I also like how sturdy they are. My Shure, while a higher quality (closed) sound, broke where the ear enclosures expand. Great bang for the bucks.                    Sound quality is subjective, so I won't say much about it. To me they sound great, as good as my M-Audio studio monitors. I've powered them from a Scarlett 2i2 and an internal laptop soundcard, both drive them at a fine volume. My android phone (Samsung Vibrant) is a little on the quiet side, but still usable.They are very comfortable. The cushions are nice and soft, and fit over my ears completely. The auto-adjusting headband feels great. They don't fit quite as snug as I'd like, but they are secure on my head.They feel solid, and can be wrenched around pretty good and retain their shape. I like the fact that the cord is detachable, and can be replaced if damaged. I also like the screw-on 1/4" adapter, which is nice and secure.I wanted the mkII version, as they come with a second set of cushions (velvet) and coiled cable. I feel like the velvet cushions would be less prone to sweat, and I much prefer coiled cables as they don't twist, and are good space-wise. I couldn't justify the price difference though.If the price difference drops to where the mkII isn't much more (say $10-$15 or so) I'd go with those. Same headphones, more bonuses. If you don't like coiled cables or velvet cushions, these are just as good.                    Man I had to repurchase these AKG'S they are killer phones!!! I am in an extensive recording program at my school and the right headphones are essential to the labs there and let me say that they are absolutely superb.  Someone stole the first pair I had, and I rarely repurchase the same item twice but these were definitely worth the reinvestment.  True sound, ultra clear highs and low end without distortion.  I'd recommend these, and they cover your entire ear, I know it says semi open but it covers the entire ear and they are super comfortable too.  Hope this helps                    I am a Broadcast Media student and a Senior at UCM. I did a solid week-2weeks worth of research before buying the AKG-240's. Perhaps the most salient finding was that this unit is based on an older design and that engineers and students have been using these cans for years. No wonder they work so well! First of all, cost. You wont find a better set of headphones unless your willing to pay over 300.00$. Personally, I wanted a dual purpose set for both in-studio-sessions and listening to my ipod touch and the AKG-240K's did not disappoint me. From low freq-high freq these sound great w/good bass response as well. I recommend purchasing a little mini-amp for that added equalization and bass for those (you know who you are) are "serious about music and good sound. I purchased the little Fiio E6 Headphone Amp w/the L9 shape out dock for ipod and the lil amp is simple to operate and really boosts the sound. I love listening to Dream Theater, Rush, or Led Zepplin with the added volume. Additionally, the Fiio E6 helps me manually adjust the sound with the amp-unit so I dont have to touch or look at my ipod screen, making it easier to operate. I'm glad I popped the extra 30 bucks at the same time I purchased the headphones on Amazon. Sadly, in my research, I found that the K240's are no longer "made in Austria." I couldn't find a pair made in Austria at any warehouse in the US. (not sayin' it can't be done but a checked numerous companies/sources) The company is now "AKG Acoustics" (made in China) But I find the ear-pads soft/comfortable and I'm wearing them 3-4 hours at a stretch at the radio station that I work at. I LOVE the fact that the cord is detachable from the headset. If the cord ever goes bad or gets damaged, you just buy a new cord. Great feature. It comes with an extra long cord and an 1/4 inch TRS (Tip-Ring-Sleeve) gold adapter. The self-adjusting headset has worked well for me and my head is a normal size for a man. Great value and I get lot's of compliments. An old cousin of mine put them on and was blown away. They also look very pro-like and hang up well when not in use. The product comes with a 2 year warranty delivered in a nice gold box. (not real gold/lol) I'm glad I picked the K240's. UPDATED: Jan 2013; My headphones began crackling after 7 months but I believe it was the cheap plastic chinese cord. They were still under warranty (2 years I believe) and I contacted the company and Harmon in Fortuna,CA fixed them in a couple weeks. I'm pretty sure it was the cord because the unit came back with a more flexible./higher quality cord (I know because I deal w/audio everyday) No further issues and they sound great. I just had to pop the five bucks to ship them to CA.                    These are my first headphones from AKG and I must say, they are fantastic! I'm hearing instruments that I've never heard before even on Bose QC15s.                    These are the best headphones I have ever purchased.  The sound is dynamic and comfort wonderful. I would recommend these to anyone who wants good sound and comfort for the money.
!###i'm a tough critic.  I always read the bad reviews, but with caution but I want to know the real deal.  So I decided to retire my 1992 240 AKG's.  Twenty years of dailly use.  The cable is shot.Down to the wires, just a matter of time before I step on the cable in the dark and they are gone.  Time to update.  Decided on these cuz I Love AKG, best studio heads I know.can listen all day without fatigue.  These have a mini plug, my video cameras need them. I hate most adaptors.  Mini has become more standard.  Zoom uses it.  So I got my order yesturday and tired them. A/Bed them to the older headphones.  Much more dynamic range.  I was surprized.  Spent about twenty minutes comparing, then packed away the 92 versions.These are good low level Pro headphones.  I'm happy.  I'm seldom happy with products cuz most so called pro stuff is really consumer plus or kids in garages.  See my review on JBL small computer speaker for some advice.I'll live with these and when I get some cash, buy some high end AKGs.  I like what i hear.  May not be top of line but my audio and music sound good.                    These are honestly, astounding. These things have clarity, good mids, good highs, the bass is not over powering, it is SUPER LIGHT, and the detachable cable makes this thing hassle free. These headphones are awesome. Beats by Dre are crap compared to these. AKG, i give you 2 thumbs up.                    I must say, I'm an AKG believer now! An amplifier is not necessary, but it will add so much more to the enjoyment of these headphones. I let a friend listen to these with just the Iphone and he was impressed. And then I let him listen with an added amplifier and he just started laughing. He just looked at me and said, "I want those." I'd say this is a great buy for the beginner headphone audiophile. Headphones can become serious business as the price and quality increases, but for most people price stipulates the range of headphones available and these are great for their price of around $100. I have no doubts the AKG brand gets better from here.These are semi-open and people sitting near you can hear the sound. So these are better for home listening or in a park or environment where people will not become distracted or annoyed by the sound. These are not very appropriate for a library environment.Try plugging these into your Iphone and then plug them into your laptop and just gasp at the difference the power makes.I'd say get these and don't look back.                    The headphones were one of the best i have heard in terms of the audio.Crisp, balanced and able to bring out the base line.  Problem:  I am looking for a set that is a little lighter on the ear.  To listen to a long Act from an opera (1hr and 15 minutes minimum) is a bit uncomfortable.                    This headphone is simply great. Music is crystal clear when connected to a decent soundcard playing a good quality mp3 or FLAC. Very uncoloured phone, which was the main reason I bought it. I simply hate these phones with intensely heavy bass (DR.Dre like) piercing your ear.Overall, I'm not too deep into the interior building of this kind of electronics, and can't get quite technic about this headphone. All I can say is that it pleases me for the reason I bought: Use on my PC and enjoy music with pleasure.Since I got this to use with my PC, I've also bought a Zalman Zm-mic1 microphone (cable clipping mic) in order to use Voip and play games, which simply completes this headphone.Definately recommend it!                    Not a professional just know what sounds good, compared AKG Acoustics k240 to Sennheiser hd280 Pro at a local Sam Ash along with several other headphones, except Grado SR 60i, using the IPod Touch for which they will be used with. The Sennheisers, a closed headphone, had a greater range of loudness n were quite crisp, but very uncomfortable! The AKGs, a open headphone, were less loud but a warmer sound and extremely comfortable. Found open design needed for listening to books n music while driving, COMFORT then sound made decision easy. Plenty of pros have reviewed this product, not doing studio work, just listening. Like eyes of the beholder so are ears of the beholder. As a side note they keep the ole ears warm too!                    First and foremost, these are great cans.  Sounds reproduction is true.  I picked up a little sibilance on some audio yesterday but in all fairness it was an mp3, so credit where it's due... these are great headphones. These headphones are built for audiophiles, not the "trendy" consumer.  As such, they're not bass-heavy or optimized for one specific genre of music. They will be true to your EQ and I'd say they are the flattest headphones I've owned, in terms of even response throughout the entire spectrum.  They do a great job revealing the lack of high-end with compressed audio.  These are open air, and by no means "isolating" headphones.  You will easily be able to hear the world outside you, and be careful cranking up the gain too much as you'll feedback into the mic if you're doing studio work.  What I did not expect was for them to be made in China.  I thought high-end AKGs would come from Austria.  While I appreciate the more affordable price point, I'm saddened to see another company farm off its manufacturing.  No idea if the construction is as long lasting, but the sound quality is what I expected.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.                    The things are built tough, the sound is so neutral and clean, perfect if your trying to mix down a track.  It gives a fairness that my Beats by Dre headphones lack, if you can mix your track so that it sounds well in these, then it will sound good on everything else too.  I love em, I just might order another pair today.                    Pros: Highs and mids are excellent. When I put on black eyed peas it sounds like every instrument has room to "breathe."Cons: Compared to sealed off headphones they don't have that much bass. HOWEVER the bass is very clear. To paint a picture it's almost the same sound they might hear in the studio compared to music in a club.Compared to my bose AE-1 the k-240s have less bass but that is for a reason. Bose have a closed and angled driver while these are way more open.Compared to audio technica AD 300, the mid and highs aren't as crystal clear like I would've hoped however my AD 300 leaked way more sound and when some songs that played had TOO much dynamic range I could hear the headset be distorted.I will come back to this review when I build a cmoy active amplifer made for 55-ohm headphones. Right now i'm playing it off my ipod touch 4th gen. I'm sure they amp will give more breathing room to the headphones.NOTE: they say this headphones are ready for digital devices. In my opinion this is NOT true. The amp in digital devices are made to drive (20-40)-ohm headphones like earbuds they sell with those devices. If you wanna take advantage of these headphones you will need to buy or make your own headphone amp. If you like bass in your music with these types of headphones I recommend buying a cmoy BB amp(BB=bass boost). Its a very hi quality amp and a great project for DIYers for $50 or you can buy it pre-made for a $80 (including shipping).                    Got a pair of AGK K240's at the local music store after my second pair of Grado Labs headphones started cutting out (cord issues). Long story short both the ATK and the Grado have their strengths and weaknesses.Both my Grado's (SR60 & SR80) are very tight, crisp, punchy, & clean with an impressive range of highs and lows but what they have in sound quality they lack in durability. I put a lot of heavy use and even a little abuse on them (running over the cord with my chair on occasion) and have never had issues with with comfort (because I used the older style flat pads). But after a year or two of daily use I usually have to tape or glue parts of the head band to make it stay together and one or both of the phones starts to cut out which is a shame because I would gladly pay a little more to have the construction quality match the sound.The AGK's appear to have a little more bulk to them except for the skimpier cord but fortunately it is removable/replaceable which is a nice feature if it gets damaged. Comfort is nice as well and doesn't isolate too much noise around me (I wear them at work). Sound wise they are a little flatter in the highs and muddier in the bass range but the sound stage is noticeably more impressive (probably in part due to the more closed ear design). The ATK K240's sound bigger and offer a more 3 dimensional sound experience even if certain parts of the frequency sound distant. Have read a few reviews saying that these cans have a tendency to cut out too but only time will tell. So far they have been good for the $ but if Grado upgrades the fit and finish on their Prestige Series I may be swayed to go back next time I'm in the market for new cans.
!###The Canon Rebel T3i takes the consumer level dSLR a couple steps closer to the mid-level Canon 60D with the addition of the rotating rear LCD screen, remote flash firing, and in-camera processing features.  The already highly competent, older Rebel T2i already shared many important features with the 60D (and even features of the semi-pro 7D) including the 18 MP sensor, 63-zone exposure metering system, high ISO performance, HD movie capabilities, and Digic 4 image processor.  With these new upgrades, it might make it even more difficult to choose between them.  But there are some important differences.If you are considering the Rebel T3i vs T2i, the Rebel T3i is replacing the T2i.  Since both cameras share the same 18 megapixel sensor and Digic 4 processor, both the T2i and T3i will create images with exactly the same image quality, produce the same low light/ high ISO performance, shoot at 3.7 frames per second, and have nearly the same size and build quality.  They are both offered with the same 18-55mm kit lens (with some minor cosmetic differences on the new T3i kit lens).  The T3i is very slightly larger and heavier due to the addition of the rotating rear LCD monitor.  And that is one of the biggest differences between the two cameras.  Do you want and need a vari-angle rear screen or not?  The other major difference is the ability of the T3i to remotely control multiple off-camera flashes.  Like the 60D and 7D, you can use the built-in flash of the T3i to trigger other Canon Speedlites.  Some other minor additions to the T3i include the Scene Intelligent Auto Mode, which is a feature borrowed from point and shoot cameras.  When in Auto mode, the T3i will make a determination of what type of scene you are shooting - close-up, portrait, landscape, etc. - and automatically configure the camera settings accordingly.  However, if you want to use a powerful and costly digital SLR as a point and shoot, you should probably save the money and just buy a nice, high quality point and shoot like the Canon S95.  Other additional but not essential upgrades include the in-camera processing Creative Filters, and the ability to choose different image size ratios and to rate your images.  (Helpful hint: press the Q Button while in image playback and you can access features like rating, rotating, and Creative Filters.)  There is also a marginally helpful Feature Guide which gives brief descriptions of various settings and some additional video features like Video Snapshot, which you can use to shoot short video clips that are automatically joined together into a video, with music.Canon Rebel T3i  vs. 60D vs. 7DSensor and Image Quality:  All three cameras share a very similar sensor and 18 megapixels, and so their image quality will be virtually the same.  All are capable of taking professional quality images.Exposure Metering: The three cameras all share the latest 63-zone, dual-layer exposure metering system and 4 metering modes. That means they will all determine the exposure virtually identically and enable you to take properly exposed photos in most every situation, including difficult back-lit scenes. The size of the areas metered for Partial and Spot metering vary slightly between the cameras, but that isn't anything critical.Autofocus: The T3i shares a similar autofocus system to the 60D, with 9 focus points and three auto focusing modes. However the 9 AF points of the 60D are more sensitive than those of the T3i: all are cross-type in the 60D, only the center is cross-type in the T3i. The 60D autofocus system is much less complex than the sophisticated AF system of the 7D with its 19 AF point system and its additional Zone, Spot, and Expansion focus modes.  These various modes address how you want to deal with and group the numerous AF points.  Plus the custom settings of the 7D allow one to customize how the AF system works - how it tracks subjects, how it deals with objects that come between you and your initial subject, how quickly it responds to these changes of possible subjects that are at different distances from you, etc.  However, if you are not an avid sports photographer, a wildlife shooter, or someone who understands, needs, and will use the elaborate features of the 7D AF system, then this shouldn't sway you.Construction: As you can probably figure out from the prices, each camera is not built the same. The T3i has relatively strong construction of a stainless steel frame with polycarbonate body.  The 60D has a stronger and lighter aluminum frame and polycarbonate body, but not as strong as the 7D's magnesium alloy construction. The 60D also has some amount of weather sealing - more than the T3i, less than the 7D. But for most users, including even those using the camera daily or in travel situations, the construction of any of these cameras is far more than good enough, strong enough, and durable enough.ISO: Since they all share a very similar sensor, the ISO sensitivity and performance at high ISO settings is virtually the same for these three cameras. But don't take my word for it, don't be swayed by pixel peepers on forums, instead check out the camera sensor tests at dxomark to verify this.  As you can see, they all share the exact same overall score, and show very similar performance.Controls: As with construction, the buttons and controls vary with these cameras. Unlike the T3i, the 60D and 7D have nearly every control an advanced photographer needs on the exterior of the camera and they also have the top LCD panel and rear Quick Control Dial that are not on the T3i. With all the cameras, any controls can also be easily accessed with the Q Button and Q Menu or in the other menus on the rear LCD monitor. The top buttons of the 60D set only one setting each, so this is less complicated than the multiple-setting buttons of the 7D. Canon has removed the white balance (WB) button on the 60D that the 7D has, but that isn't a big deal - use the Q Menu. Another change on the 60D is that the Multi-controller has been moved from the thumb joystick like the 7D and 50D and placed in the middle of the rear Quick-control dial. This doesn't change how it functions, and should just be a matter of getting used to the difference.  If you plan on using your camera on Auto or Program most of the time, then the controls of the T3i are more than sufficient for your needs.  If you work in Av, Tv, or M modes and need quicker and more direct access to your controls and the additional top LCD screen to view and change your current settings, then you need to consider the 60D or 7D over the T3i.Menus and Custom Functions: These allow for greater control over customizing how the camera functions.  The T3i has less Menu and Custom Function setting options than the 60D, and the 7D has yet a few more than the 60D. These settings enable you to customize the operation, function, and controls to work how you want them to, including things like exposure increments, peripheral illuminations correction for lenses (fixes dark corners), tweaking how the autofocus system operates, setting more precise white balance settings, and customizing which button does what.  There are ebooks such as my Canon T3i Experience - The Still Photographer's Guide to Operation and Image Creation With the Canon Rebel T3i / EOS 600D and Your World 60D - The Photographer's Guide to Operation and Image Creation with the Canon 60D which walk you through all of the Menu settings and Custom Function settings so that you can set up your camera to work best for how you photograph, and also begin to learn to master all the advanced features, settings, and controls of these powerful dSLR camera.Wireless Flash: Like the 7D and 60D, the T3i incorporates wireless flash triggering. This allows you to trigger multiple off camera flashes at different output levels. The T2i does not have this feature.Articulating LCD Screen: The big new feature that the 60D and T3i have that the 7D and T2i do not is the articulating rear LCD screen. This may prove useful for videographers, as well as for setting up compositions while the camera is on a tripod, for macro use, or for using it from unusually low or high vantage points. Some users will be able to avoid buying an expensive angle finder because of this feature. There is also an electronic level in the 7D and 60D, visible in the viewfinder, rear LCD, or top LCD.Viewfinder: The T3i has a pentamirror viewfinder with 95% coverage of the actual resulting image.  The 60D has a large, bright pentaprism viewfinder with 96% coverage, not quite as nice as the nearly 100% view of the 7D pentaprism.Processor: The T3i shares the same Digic 4 processor as the 60D. The 7D has dual Digic 4 processors. However, if you don't need to shoot dozens of continuous images, you probably won't notice any processing speed issues.Continuous Shooting Speed: The T3i can shoot 3.7 frames per second.  The 7D can shoot a blazing 8 frames per second, in which the photos barely change from frame to frame.  The 60D can shoot a respectable 5.3 fps which is actually a more useful rate.  If you need the extremely high fps for sports, wildlife, or other action shooting, get the 7D.  If not, don't be swayed by this excessive feature.Memory Card: The T3i and 60D use the SD memory card.  The 7D uses the CF card.Battery: The T3i and T2i use the smaller LP-E8 battery with less capacity than the LP-E6 battery used by the 60D and 7D.Size and Weight: The T3i is smaller and lighter than the 60D, which in turn is smaller and lighter than the 7D.  Go to a store and hold them to get a better feel for their size, weight, and feel.  The 60D and 7D "feel" like the more substantial cameras that they are.  A nice improvement of the T3i is that its hand grip area has been modified, and has a different feel than that of the T2i - the area where the thumb rests is contoured differently and has a nice channel for the thumb, which allows for a much more secure one-hand-grip of the camera.AF Microadjustment: The 7D has this feature, the 60D and T3i and T2i do not.  This allows you to adjust the focus of each of your lenses in case any of them are slightly front-focusing or back-focusing.Locking Mode Dial: This is a new feature for a Canon dSLR, only on the 60D, that keeps the Mode dial from accidentally rotating. A nice touch.Full HD video: Of course they all offer this capability.  Note that this is not video for your kids' parties and soccer games.  It does not have continuous autofocus while shooting, as a camcorder does.  It is not designed for that kind of use, but rather for serious videographers who typically manually focus.  You can adjust autofocus while shooting by pressing the shutter button or the AF button, but it may have a less than desired looking result and unless you are using an external microphone, the autofocusing sound will be picked up.  The T3i has the digital zoom feature in video, which allows for nice smooth zooms while filming.Flash Sync: the 60D and T3i do not have a PC sync flash socket to plug in PC sync cords for off camera flash use.  The 7D has this.  However, they all offer wireless remote flash capability with the built in flash as a commander.Ease of operation: While beginners may find all the buttons, controls, and menus of any dSLR difficult and confusing at first, the menus and controls of the T3i and T2i are pretty basic and simple to learn for a dedicated user.  The additional controls and menus of the 7D and 60D are all quite intelligently designed, intuitive, and straightforward for the more advanced user.  Again, have a look at helpful guides such as my Canon T3i Experience - The Still Photographer's Guide to Operation and Image Creation With the Canon Rebel T3i / EOS 600D and Your World 60D - The Photographer's Guide to Operation and Image Creation with the Canon 60D to begin to learn to master all the advanced features, settings, and controls of these powerful dSLR cameras.                    I am not a camera expert, but rather, I'm a busy mom who likes to take pictures and who adores my subjects. This, then, is a review from a mom/amateur's point of view.MY GOALS/EXPECTATIONS:I have always been a photo fiend, taking my camera everywhere and pulling it out at any opportunity. While I'd gotten to a decent level of archiving important moments with my point-and-shoot cameras over the years, I wanted to take my photography to the next level. I was inspired by my brother-in-law's photos of his kids to take the dSLR plunge. But I knew (and still know), very little about professional photography. I wanted to start taking better photos right away. But I also wanted to have room to grow as a photographer and a camera that would grow with me.I also wanted the focus to stay firmly on my family - while I was willing to invest some time and care into the camera, I didn't want it to become like a pet I had to constantly watch over. While any dSLR takes some care and consideration, I've found the T3i has been an excellent camera for me and I've been quite pleased with it.PROS:* VERY USER FRIENDLY: The auto mode (or auto without flash, my favorite) is highly forgiving, taking fantastically sharp images, true to color. They look so clear that I feel I'm capturing as close to real life as I've ever seen before in a camera.* FAST: While I sometimes go in for trying out new modes and manual settings, I often leave the camera in auto or auto-sans-flash mode and just click away so that I can at least capture a moment before it's gone. I then play with manual settings if my kids stay still long enough for me to try something new. My previous cameras always had a horrible delay for the autofocus (the only mode they usually had), meaning I nearly always lost the moment when the toddler was on the move. The t3i is so ridiculously fast that I can snap multiple pics in the time one picture took before.* BEAUTIFUL PICTURES: This kind of goes without saying at this tier of camera, but the pictures are just amazing quality. Coming from the land of point-and-shoot, I'm pretty blown away. And I know I'm only touching the tip of the iceberg for what's possible.* BEAUTIFUL VIDEO: This is the nice new feature of the t3i. I wasn't sure I'd want or need the HD video. But hey, when you've got it, you use it. I've gotten some amazingly clear footage of the kiddo playing in the park with daddy and I'm so glad we went for the model with that feature.* BIG, CLEAR DISPLAY: It's really easy to see what pics you've just taken and adjust your photo-taking accordingly. Just by seeing what I've gotten, I'm able to try again and improve a shot almost immediately.* CLEAR MENUS/ABILITY TO IMPROVE: The interface on this is so intuitive that I've been able to learn a lot without even cracking open the manual (though that manual is my new reading material). The entry point for a new user is just a step up from normal photography - the possibilities, however, are nearly endless.* NICE KIT LENS: For all that photographers get into new and better lenses, the kit lens on this is really nice and easy to use. I think it will hold us for a good long while before I get to be more of an expert. It gives me the range of zoom and focus I need for now.* EYE-FI COMPATIBLE: WOW. I cannot even tell you how much I love this feature. If you get an eye-fi card, your pictures can be set up to automatically upload to your computer whenever you are within range of your synched wireless network. My husband set up a SmugMug account and the eye-fi capabilities. I take pics to my heart's content while out on walks, in the park, etc., and come home, then leave the camera on (auto-shut off after 8 minutes) to upload the pics. I can then tag and sort pictures later at my leisure. For me, this is amazingly useful. I don't have to take time out of my day to upload the pics - the camera does that for me.* BATTERY LIFE (for common use): So far, the battery we bought for the camera lasts very well during normal photo-taking. It's just a standard Canon battery for the rebel line and it charges quickly. Even when taking pics like a mad-woman, it lasts through a shoot. HD video eats it up more quickly, so be warned. Still, I rarely run out of juice during the day so long as I pop the battery into its charger in the evening. However, uploading is another story (See below in cons).Those are just the first few things I love about this camera. Here, however, are the...not cons, really, just challenges:CHALLENGES:* dSLRs ARE EXPENSIVE, DELICATE, BIG AND BULKY:And parents have enough precious and delicate things to worry about - namely, the kids. No getting around it - you can't just toss a dSLR into a pocket and go. I'm in a quest for a good bag/carrying solution (heh, yeah, wish me luck with that.) and I'm trying to get used to having one part of my brain keeping an eye on the camera as well as keeping the majority of my focus on the kids. When I'm in photo-journalist mode, it's no problem, but switching back to mom-mode is the hard part. I've already seen the camera knocked onto the ground (a very short distance onto very soft ground, so it was okay, but still, the experience practically gave me a heart attack) and once, when bending over, I caught the toddler on the temple with the kit lens (She sobbed. I felt so awful!) This thing requires constant awareness to both the camera AND the kids when using it. I'm quickly adjusting, but if you're not totally committed to learning to use and love the dSLR, you may want to stick to really good point-and-shoot camera if you're a busy parent.^ That's the big one.* BATTERY LIFE (when uploading pics via eye-fi): Uploading pictures by eye-fi seems to eat the battery alive. It appears that the camera won't autoshutoff when uploading, so this morning, after a few hours of uploading big, glorious pictures to my SmugMug account, the battery finally ran out of juice. I wish there was a plug-in mode or some sort of docking-station I could plug the camera into when I return home. If it's only a few pics, they upload and the camera shuts itself off. But if it's a bunch of pics (and when the weather's nice and the lighting's good, I take a lot of pics), the camera requires a battery recharge just to finish uploading my pictures.* SWIVEL SCREEN WORRIES: I find that the swivel screen, while hugely useful, is something I constantly worry that I'm going to snap off. However, you can keep it closed with the screen facing in(a nice feature) or tuck it onto the camera with the screen facing out. I also find if I'm looking out of the eye-piece, I leave cheek smudges all over the screen when its facing out.* MANUAL-MODE GOOFS: Some of my manual mode forays have been less than stellar. I've taken a shot - set up so nice, focus just perfect, subject just so... only to find out I left it in white-balance adjustment for indoors and I was outdoors so the whole picture looks like I dipped it in blue. I've learned to take pics in auto-mode first before experimenting too much. I also learned to check the screen a LOT before proceeding.SUMMARY: While the dSLR has required me to make some adjustments for including it in my busy life, I really love this camera, am pleased with the investment, am inspired by its ease of use, and I LOVE the pictures I've gotten of my family.5 STARS: And so I give it 5 stars - my whole point in buying a nice camera was to make and preserve FAMILY memories - and the t3i records those memories beautifully - in .jpg, raw, or HD video - with a minimum of dSLR fuss.*** UPDATE: about 6 months later ***STILL AWESOME:  I totally stand by the above review. If anything, I've come to adore this camera even more than I did when we first got it. When baby #2 arrived, the quality of pictures that we got far surpassed the pictures from the first baby's photo shoots. I'm truly pleased with this investment, as the pictures we get are lovely, clear, true-to-light/true-to-color, and just capture the memories so well. Really, this is EXACTLY what I was hoping for as an amateur photographer/mom.GOT BETTER:Battery Woes: We invested in an A/C adapter for the camera and now no longer eat the battery alive when leaving the camera to upload pictures via the Eye-Fi connection. It's a little annoying to have to swap over to the A/C and then back to a battery all the time - I would rather have a charging station of sorts - but it works and it means I stick the battery in the charger so it's almost always ready to go.Ease of Use: I adjusted to using this thing pretty quickly. I invested in a LowePro FastPack 250 and it works nicely as a diaper-bag/day bag/camera bag. Not the most attractive purse, but it works well. I'm much better at being ready for any photo situation now.Swivel Screen: No problems to report. I just leave it screen out all the time.SAME: Awesome camera all around. Truly, truly impressive. There might be higher tiers of quality out there, but for what I use in following the kids around, this captures amazing shots quickly. Love it.GOT (just a little) WORSE:Eye-Fi Annoyance: This is going to differ from person to person, but our Eye-Fi stuff has had some kinks to work out. The card we bought required several updates lately, then we had to change SmugMug account stuff, but the changed password meant Eye-Fi couldn't upload. Blah, blah, blah, I'm sure most of the problem is ME not getting the changes my hubby made. Still, Eye-Fi is usually automatic, but from time to time, it requires maintenance and understanding from all parties uploading stuff. Just be warned, it isn't so automagical as I hoped it would be.Getting used to the dSLR bulk: I'd be lying if I said the size of the camera wasn't occasionally an issue. There have been quite a few times I think, "Oh, where's the camera? That's right, I left it at home/in the car because it's kind of a pain to pack around." On many occasions, the hubby's phone camera stood in for us (and it takes pretty decent pictures, so it's okay). But if I'm not being really deliberate about bringing the dSLR and using it, this camera becomes a very expensive toy that I never play with.Other than that ^ though, awesome camera. I'm truly loving it. On the whole, a Lotta camera for Low maintenance.                    Check out my full T3i review video, video clips, sample photos and time lapse on YouTube. On YouTube search "2012 T3i Best DSLR"Okay, now let's take a fresh look at the Canon EOS Rebel T3i (600D) DSLR and compare it to the 60D and T2i. In this review I'll also talk about some "MUST HAVE" accessories for this camera.The Canon EOS Rebel T3i DSLR was release in March of 2011 and has quickly become one of the most popular DSLRs available.As if the Rebel line wasn't popular enough with budding photographers... The introduction of the T3i has captured the imagination of thousands of aspiring videographers... with it's ability to capture FULL HD video... bright, articulating 3 inch LCD screen (which comes in really handy when shooting video in the field), and the ability to select from a host of lenses... which is common to DSLRs in general.Professionals prefer DSLRs because they allow for an accurate preview of what they are shooting, at the moment they push the shutter button. DSLRs also have larger sensors than compact point-and-shoot digital cameras (which means a better quality and high-resolution image)...Full HD video and interchangeability of lenses are particularly attractive to wannbe videographers (especially in a sub-$1000 DSLR... like the T3i)... because NOW they can shoot amazing HD video footage for a fraction of the what it would have cost... just a few years ago... PLUS they end up with a great camera for still photography...The Canon T3i (600D) ships with the body, battery, battery charger, USB interface cable, AV cable, EOS solution disk (that contains the really handy EOS utility - I'll talk about this a bit more later...) and a suitable strap (although I quickly replaced mine). AND if you desire... a kit lens...The T3i is considered a compact DSLR at 5.2 inches wide, 3.9 inches high and 3.1 inches deep (not including a lens)... compared to the larger and more expensive 60D at 5.69 inches wide, 4.17 inches high and 3.09 inches deep.The T3i is very similar in size, weight and features to the less expensive T2i. The T3i feels solid and well made and is comfortable in the hand...But I do have smaller hands... So if your hands are larger you may want to look to the 60D OR grab the Zeikos battery, power grip... for your T3i...with an additional battery...This battery grip doubles the amount of shooting you can do between battery changes AND provides a much large grip surface.At the heart of the Canon T3i is an 18 megapixel CMOS digital sensor and the DIGIC 4 processor. This sensor and processor are also found in Canon's 60D and T2i.The camera has one SD card slot that can take a regular SD, SDHC or SDXC card... The T3i does not ship with a card. So plan on adding that to your your list.I highly recommend using nothing less than a class 10 SDHC card for with this camera, especially if you want to shoot HD video.  Even if you don't, you'll want a fast card when shooting continuous photos at 18 mega pixels. I personally like 32 GB cards because they are pretty cheap now and give you enough room to shoot photos all day. Plus 32 giga bites is large enough to hold almost 2 hours of HD video.The T3i has what Canon calls "Live View Shooting"...which provides a very accurate simulation of photos and video using the LCD screen... This is especially helpful when doing a video shoot without a separate field monitor.The 3 inch variable angle LCD monitor is bright enough for shooting in full sun... and can be flipped so that if lays flat against the camera back or can be positioned at various angles for high and low shooting.But remember... as with any camera-powered monitor, it will consume your batteries faster when you are using it. Brightness also effects battery consumption (which can be adjusted in the camera's setup menu). That being said, the flip and twist capabilities of this monitor make it a priceless asset for videographers and creative photographers.One of the major differences between the T3i and the 60D is it's continuous shooting speed of 3.7 frames per second verse the 60Ds 5.3 frames per second.For me, this was not an issue as I purchased my T3i primarily for shooting video. But if you like to shoot action, you may want to consider the 60D.The controls of the T3i are easy to access with the thumb and four finger.  And are pretty easy to master with little effort... I do suggest keeping the manual near as it will prove a valuable asset and will save frustration as your skills progress.One thing that really impressed about this camera was a real world example of how easy it is for a beginner to get professional results, with this camera... out of the box.One day my son... who has never used a DSLR camera before, went on a walk with my new T3i. When he came back I could tell from his face that he experienced something really special. His big smile made me very curious to see his photos.I was amazed at the stunning images this camera enabled him to capture... as he simply used the camera's scene "intelligent auto mode" and the dial-selectable "creative zone modes."When you select a different dial mode, the camera shows a short and helpful description of that mode. This feature can accelerate your progress and help to quickly hone in on a mode that is best suited for the type of shooting you are doing.My son's experience helped me realize what a fantastic job Canon did skinning over this formidable professional-level camera... with a simple and easy to use point-and-shoot-like interface... that enables the novice (like my son) to achieve very satisfying results.I am convinced that results are one of the reasons that owners rate this camera MUCH higher (close to 5 out of 5 stars) than professional reviewers who usually rate this camera at less than 4 out of 5 starts... and tend to nit pick about technical details and specifications.I'm not saying that specs are not important... but what I am saying is that, at the end of the day... all that matters is that you have good quality photos and videos to show for your effort, regardless of your experience level.The T3i allows you to easily select and scroll between ISO 100 (for well-lit scenes) to ISO 6400 for lower lighting scenarios.Photo quality generally looks great up through ISO 800 and begins to show some small signs of degradation from ISO 1,600 on.The little scrolling wheel toward the front of the camera makes selection of a variety of functions... including ISO... really easy.The 9-pt autofocus systems is accurate and quick for photos... but does struggle in very low light situations.The T3i camera does have the ability to autofocus while you are shooting video... but often takes a few seconds to refocus focus...Plus the noise of the camera while focusing.... will likely be heard in your video. You will also find that the battery life will deplete rapidly when autofocusing a lot during a video.All this being said, the T3i's video autofocus is pretty useless. Fortunately there are plenty of other great reasons to like this camera...As with most cameras these days the T3i includes optical image stabilization that works well... with off-hand shooting.The T3is battery life is generally good... however, battery life is so subjective and is very dependent on how you shoot, the brightness of your LCD screen...  and things like... whether you are using autofocus or not...For shooting photos, I have found the battery life to be excellent allowing me to take 400 to 600 shots before needed a change.Shooting video will consume your batteries at a much more rapid rate if you are using the camera's LCD screen to monitor your video.So I would recommend that you pick up a few additional batteries. I have found a very inexpensive, after-market brand... that have proven to be just as reliable as the OEM battery that came with this camera. See my YouTube Review for more info on the accessories that I mention in this review...And if you want to seriously extend the battery life of this camera (which is especially useful on location during a video shoot)... you should pick up the Zeikos Battery Power Grip for this camera that I mentioned earlier.This is a high quality accessory that matches the camera in look and feel in every way and is less pricy than Canon's version.It easily and securely attaches to the camera and has a removable tray that allows you to power the camera with 2 batteries instead of one.This grip also comes with an additional tray that allows you to use 6 double A batteries to power the camera in a pinch. This is a great safety net for those involved in remote shooting... away from a power source.If you don't want to be limited by batteries, Canon offers a DC power unit. There is a battery sized coupler that you simply insert into the battery port to power the camera by plugging it into a wall outlet.For this accessory, I would only recommend the Canon brand.One nice feature for those who wear corrective lenses (like me)... is the quality dioptric adjustment knob for the camera view finder.This knob allows for plus and minus adjustments to ensure that you see things clearly through the view finder. Although this feature is common in many DSLRs... I was glad to find out that the T3i had it after the fact...The T3i has a built-in mono microphone that sounds pretty good for general video shooting and includes an effective wind filter that can be toggled on and off in the camera's setup.However, for serious video production I recommend that you use a quality external microphone to capture your audio. I use a Zoom H4N for a large range of purposes and really affordable Audio Technica lapel mics for shooting interviews and promotional videos. A Rode shotgun mic is another that you may want to consider.On the side of the T3i there is a 1/8 inch stereo mic input. With the appropriate adapters you can send audio from 2 different mics directly into the camera's left and right channels. The camera allows you for manual adjustment of the record levels which is very useful.There are several other camera ports which include... A remote control terminal. I picked up a very affordable timer remote that I use often for time lapse videos and low light situations.There's digital audio / video out terminal and a mini HDMI out terminal this is great for using an external field monitor or hooking your camera up to your HD TV.The SD card slot is on the other side and the battery compartment in easily accessible on the bottom of the camera.When it comes to video the T3i really shines. It offers full HD video at 1920 by 1080 pixels at 30, 25 and 24 frames per second... on the high end... and also offers 1280 x 720 pixels at 60 frames per second (which is nice for slow motion) as well as 640 x 480 at 30 frames per second.You can get exceptional results from this camera with a little attention to detail and by experimenting with the automatic and manual video settings... and by trying different lenses.For low lighting situations, you may want to consider picking up a Canon 50mm F1.8 lens. It's been dubbed "plastic magic" because it captures surprisingly good quality photos and video for a a lens with a street price that hovers around $100.The T3i also offers a 3x and 10x digital zoom that produces amazingly crisp video in movie mode.The camera also has a new video snapshot feature that takes short clips of video and stitches them together. It's a fun feature for walking around town and shooting short video clips or having some fun at a party.There's one VERY important aspect of shooting video with most DSLRs, and in our case, the T3i that you should be aware of.To protect the camera from internal heat generated when shooting video... the T3i will stop recording video when the file size of a single movie clip reaches 4GB.This means that if you are shooting in FULL HD that your maximum record time will be  around 10 to 14 minutes. This can be a bit annoying yet, it's easy enough to restart the video.... and if you only need to shoot clips shorter than 10 minutes you will probably never experience this issue.However this function can be problematic in situations where you need to shoot longer lengths of video, like at a conference, a sporting event, or a church sermon.One very helpful surprise that Cannon includes for free with this camera is the EOS utility software. With this software, the T3i, a reasonably modern computer (I use my MacBook Pro... 2010 vintage) and the included digital interface cable... you can extend the use of your laptop computer as a field monitor and command central for the camera.You can remotely control all important camera functions from within the very intuitive interface of this program.The EOS utility functions well for both photo and video shooting and provides a very nice simulation of what you will get...  This bonus has been particularly helpful to me for shooting video since it eliminated the need to purchase a $1,000 field monitor. Note though, that using the EOS utility will deplete your camera and laptop batteries faster than you would think. So I recommend plugging in your laptop and having a few extra batteries for your camera of getting the Canon DC coupler and power unit.The camera also has a very useful built-in flash that will automatically pop up when needed or can be accessed manually with the touch of a button.For more advanced photographers... the T3i supports the latest developments in wireless flash photography.SO who is this camera for?The T3i is best suited for those who want an easy to use, fast, reliable high-end prosumer DSLR that shoots incredible 18 mega pixel photos and FULL HD video... all in compact package for well under $1,000.If you plan on doing a lot of high speed photography you may want to consider the 60D for it's faster 5.3 frame per second continuous shooting... which is the only real major difference between the two. However this upgrade will cost you between $300 and $400.Also... if you want to save some money and don't really need the flip and turn LCD screen of the T3i... you many want to consider the T2i. This will save you around $100....I will caution you though...  if you ever think that you are going to want to shoot video, macro-zoom photographs or anything at high or low angles... you may be sorry that you didn't get the T3i with it's flippy screen.The T3i is also NOT for you if you want a compact, carry-in-your pocket camera to take with you everywhere... Even though the T3i is compact compared to many larger DSLRs... it's not small... So... if your main purpose is finding a camera to document life and have with you at all time... the T3i is probably not the camera for you.Also... If you want to eliminate your camcorder with the T3i, look somewhere else... that's not what the T3i is purposed for. It lacks seamless autofocus in video mode and is not as easy convenient to set up and use as many mini-camcorders.However, if you have a creative flair and want to shoot HD quality video productions, the T3i will help you get off to a great start.All this aside the Canon EOS Rebel T3i is an amazingly popular, all-around DSLR camera... which is evidenced by the fact that... at the time of this video review... the T3i is the #1 best selling DSLR on Amazon.The Canon T3i is an impressive value rivaling the Canon 60D in just about every way... and with it's full HD video, easy-to-use interface, exceptional 18 mega pixel image quality, large flip-and-turn LCD screen and a full set of professional functions... The T3i is a great place to jump into the wonderful world of DSLR photography and video... all for an astonishingly low street price of less than $800.VIEW MY FULL T3i VIDEO REVIEW with Test Video, Sample Photos and Time Lapse Video on YouTube by Searching "2012 T3i Best DSLR"Enjoy!                    I was so surprised how light is the T3i, (in comparison to 7D /50D or 60D) with its 18.0 mega pixel the  CMOS sensor captures superb image quality with low noise and natural colorThe EOS T3i, positioned between the EOS T2i and EOS 60D, features scene intelligent auto, 3-inch vari-angle clear view LCD and a selection of five creative filters including the new fish eye effect (which is awesome!!)honestly, once you get this camera, no need for Photoshop.I initially purchased the 7DCanon EOS 7D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3-inch LCD (Body Only), but then I returned it due to the more complicated usage, and the post-photo processing/ editing necessary for making pictures look better.T3i comes with an instructional guide built in, like the Nikon D3100 14.2MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens. The guide tells beginners (or rusty intermediates) how to set the camera to get specific types of shots. For instance, if you dial up macro mode, it says "for closeups of small objects such as flowers, shoot as close as possible."the T3i gives me all I want, clear and hassle free pictures, ready to upload/print.it uses normal SD cards, no need for the expensive CF flash cards.longer battery life, and low consumption.Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS SLR Lens comes with the camera, and it is a great lens for beginners, and gives a great opportunity to practice Manual Focus!Do not invest in expensive lenses from the start, you might like the point and shoot, and reselling the lenses might be a great loss.I'm not a professional photographer, nor an electronic specialist, so I reviewed the item as a myself, so if you like my review, please rate it.Thank you                    I bought the T2i first, then decided to upgrade to the T3i.  For a period of two weeks, I had both cameras in my possession, so I could make a direct comparison, and decided hands-down that the T2i is the one I will keep.  Why?  The T2i is FAST.  I shoot my toddler in continuous mode, and the camera delivers the 3.7 fps it's supposed to.  It makes a huge difference knowing you can press the shutter and the camera will instantly take a picture.  The T3i, however, adds frequent and unpredictable delays when "busy" flashes in the viewfinder and the red light is on -- even in continuous mode.I used the same exact settings on both cameras (large Jpeg, P-mode, Quick AF).  Compared to the instant responsiveness of the T2i, this was plain annoying and caused me to miss numerous shots.  I used the same class 10 SDHC chip in both cameras, but -- this is interesting -- even without any memory chip in the camera, the delays are still there.                    As another reviewer posted, I'm not sure of my qualifications or ability to make a detailed review of this camera, but I love it and will do my best.  Having only ever used a Canon PowerShot SD610 and cell phone cameras before, this was a huge leap for me.I use the camera primarily to take pictures of the kids and flowers/gardens.I have read through the manual and found it a great asset (I have written techmanuals and read a lot of manuals, and find this one to be very easy to use).  With its use I have tried every mode on the dial and used the Q - Quick Control to try the different functions.  With the exception of the "M" -Manual Exposure, I have taken great pictures (OK - Excellent/Awesome by my standards, the people on the photo blogs may disagree with my assessment of my photos:)).The video capability is truly amazing, but does require a fast card (class 6 and up) I have a Class 10 and noted some lag when my son was running around in a low light living room.  The Grandparents will be able to watch HD movies on their big screen.The weight is a bit hefty compared to the Point and Shoot but feels right in your hands.  I have larger hands and the grips feel really nice even when holding the camera for extended time.Battery life appears to be good, I have yet to have the battery fail on me when I need it, but I have only had the camera a short time.  Time will be the judge of this.  I did by a second battery (Canon clone, not OEM).File size requires a SD card of decent size (Large .jpg High Quality = 6.4MB, RAW = 24.5MB) the camera is compatible with SDHC and SDXC cards, I have a 16 gig SDHC Class 10 (A-Data 16 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card 16GSDHC10 (Blue)).  Not sure what the SDXC brings to the table but if I pick one up I'll update this review.Live Mode (like a standard point and shoot - LCD screen shows image to be captured) is great for videos and can help when composing shoots from various angles (taking pictures of the dog near floor - without kneeling).  There is even a Live Mode with facial recognition and tracking, chases my sons face all over and gives me the correct focus.  The Live Mode was the only mode I figured I would be able to use, but I find the standard viewfinder eyepiece to be very easy to use and has all of the information you need.I plan to have this camera for years to come and hope to someday master all of the settings (high expectations).  I feel this camera is the perfect match for my current ability (A+ Fully Automatic Shooting allows me to take excellent pictures while using the camera like a Point and Shoot) and my desire to become the photographic artist I hope to be).Anyone thinking about make the change from Point and Shoot to dSLR should really consider this camera.  May I also suggest a camera bag, and cleaning kit.I have posted a few of my images on in the photo gallery here on Amazon.                    I typically write, while we have professional photographers who do a lot of our legwork at events.  But recently, at an engagement party, I was using my trustworthy Canon Powershot and when it came to photos, for every one photo I took, my friend with his T2i was take 10 or more.  And even indoors, his pictures looked great!Because I travel and cover so many events and there are times where our photographers are busy covering things, I figured...It would be great to have a DSLR.  I was at E3 and using my point-and-shoot, I knew right then and there, it was time to get a DSLR. I've been wanting to get one but frankly, the thought of me having to invest in the camera and several lenses and knowing they are not cheap...  I hesitated.But no longer.  It was time to get a DSLR!I have to admit....I was struggling between a Nikon 5100 or a Canon T3i (EOS 600) or even considering going a little higher-end.But I've read from professionals who say, "It's the glass, not the body" and even our photographers, some of them are still using DSLR's made in the early 2000's and are quite content with the body, just focusing on the lens.For me, I wanted the best of both worlds of having something to shoot photos and video.  While I was close to getting the Nikon, the video review on digitalrev was enough to convince me to go for the T3i (EOS 600) and for its price range, I was comfortable with that.  Maybe in the future I can get something high-end but for now, I need something entry-level and with the T2i having dropped in price and selling out online and at stores, I noticed the T3i can be found and sure enough, while there are a few more technical things that it has compared to the T2i, for me, the swivel lens was something that I liked.  Especially for shots that require taking photos from weird levels and angles.  So, that was a plus for me!Upon opening the box, I realized that the T3i felt good but the higher-end cameras were more to my liking and are much more tougher.  But I figured, you get what you pay for and with the T3i, I just need to make sure I take care of it.WHAT YOU GET:I bought the version with an EF-S 18-55 IS II, so I got the lens with the two caps, inside are also the USB cord to transfer images and the Canon EOS Digital strap.  Instruction booklets, warranty registration and more.SO FAR, SO GOOD:Since owning the T3i, I have put this camera through hardcore use in a short amount of time.  Different events, different weather and have purchased quite a few things for this camera.If there is only one thing that I WISHED this camera did have was an easier menu to change things.  Aperature or Shutterspeed.  Granted, higher end models may have a display right at the top but looking at the LCD, definitely read the manual and experiment how to change various settings and experiment how you can change on the fly.And here are my thoughts that will definitely be different recommendations from others but it works for me:*  Get a good prime lens - 50mm 1.8 (preferably a 1.4) Canon lens.  I have the former which works great for portrait shots but I know already that the 1.4 works much better...it's also several hundred dollars more.*  Third party - I went third party for batteries, grip, hoods and they work perfectly.  I know there are diehards who purchase official Canon products but they are expensive and if you want to save money, look toward third party products.*  Read the Manual - I know there are people (like myself) who are impatient of reading manuals but in this case, read the manuals, especially those Canon-based brochures of lenses they recommend.*  Lenses - L lenses are great if you can afford them but if you can get yourself some Canon glass with image stabilization, this works great for entry-level photographers!  But if you are in it for the video, you want to get better glass!*  Research and Flickr! - I did a lot of research before buying this camera and for the most part, camera sites have all been positive. But definitely do your research.  I call my photographer friends and staff with questions but seriously, I learned that they are used to their high-end cameras and used to their lenses that they can give you some advice but it's best to experiment on your own but also go on Flickr and study other photographers, look at their exif data and get an idea of what lens they shot, what aperture, what shutter speed, etc.  And try to experiment with those settings.  Granted, lighting and setting is different but it's good to research and see what others are doing and what they were able to capture and knowing what lens they use.*  Last - Shoot Raw and consider purchasing a 10-speed, 16-32GB card.  Shooting at RAW gives you more options when using software like PhotoShop or Lightroom but you definitely want to shoot at RAW.  Nothing wrong with shooting via JPG, if you can manually fix those images on your own but I regret going to one event and shooting in JPG...I wished I shot RAW.  Now I do most of the time.  I say most of the time because I am in the process of purchasing a 32GB card (10-speed) and I have shot RAW 90% and 10% of the space, shot in JPG.JUDGMENT CALL:The T3i definitely delivers in picture quality and video.  Granted, if you have another $1,500+ to spend and money is no object...then go for the higher end Canon DSLR's.  But if you want to spend under a $1,000 but want very good quality for photos and video...the T3i is great!  There is not a humongous jump in features vs. its T2i brother and for some, the T2i may be enough, in fact, if you are not planning to shoot video, some people may want just the XSi which I still see people using and have taken great pictures with it.But for me, the extra features that I saw with this camera, I have seen the potential that I can utilize in different settings of event coverage that I go to.  If there is one thing that I wish I had...better lenses.  The kit lens is a good entry level but at 18-55, there are times when I needed to switch to the EF75-33 (f4-5.6 III) and I see that my photographer had the convenience of having an 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM Lens and saw how it would make my life easier to have such a lens.In fact, I really like the IS (image stabilization lens) and now looking towards those lenses for my T3i.  The kit lens is good but you will definitely want a good zoom!  And also, I felt that using the cheap Canon 50mm 1.8 gave me more vibrant photos and better bokeh than the 18-55mm that came with the kit.As for video, the mic on the T3i is not the best, so you may want to consider purchasing a mic (one person I know uses a boom mic, another uses a mic that attaches on top T3i).  Taking video is very good but once again, if you are going for the T3i...plan to invest in larger GB cards...8GB is very good but I'm learning that I need more than that!  You may as well if you do cover events or take a lot of photos.While the menu interface could have been better, part of the convenience that Canon does give to those who spend more money...so, for under $1,000...the T3i is still a great deal for the quality it gives.I love this camera and I'm still learning as I go but so far so good! I still have yet to buy a Speedlite Flash (I do have an older Canon Speedlite from the late '70s (which I have used on a Canon A-1 SLR) that does work with the T3i but rather purchase something more modern.  And a few other things but for now, I'm just enjoying the pictures I take (and not enjoying the pictures I take, which is part of the learning process) but I'm quite content and happy that I bought this camera.If anything happens 6 months or a year down the line, I will definitely update this review.                    Purchased this, got it in 2 days, had it ONE day only when started having problems.First off...I am a long time Canon user and pro photog.  I have other EOS and Canon cameras. Digital and film.Wanted to try this new model as it had the flip out back which I wanted.The first day it worked great. Took some great photos.Next day, I went a few miles from home and took what i thought would be a great series of shots.  Never used the swing back as it was a very bright sunny day.  Just used the view finder.  It took photos...BUT...when I got home I flipped out the swing back to look at some of them real quick and discovered that there was an error code showing... Error 01  Failure of lense to communicate with camera.  Ok, fine...went to look at the photos I took and discovered I had no photos.  apparently the error happened immediately on me turning the camera on at the spot i took the photos.  I was not happy because you do not get an error code through the viewfinder if there is a problem..least not one that I saw.  Triedf to resolve the error code..as explained by support, and though nothing worked at the time, I continued trying different things and finally the error code disappeared and camera working. Ok, fine...next day...went to take some more photos..checked the screen.and the error code was back.  This time nothing i did helped.Contacted Canon support and was told to return the camera or send it to one of their repair centers. I called because on the Canon website when i clicked on their support icon for this model with lense since they dont have a listing for body only, I would get a screen saying that they were not repairing this model. Kind of strange.So am returning it to Amazon for replacement rather than sending it to the Canon repair center as I didnt want to wait possibly weeks. Amazon is great about it especially since I had it only a few days.  They are shipping a new one immediately which is fantastic and gave me a return label for return shipping for the defective camera.Not sure just what is wrong with this first one as I have never had a problem with any of my Canon cameras other than normal wear and tear over time.  So I was very surprised. But I guess with all the ones I have bought over the years, there was always the chance to get one with problems. This time, I did.  I still like the camera and I will always use Canon's.  Just diappointed that I am now having to wait a couple of days to get the new one before I get out taking photos with it.  I would still recommend it, buy which and gave 4 stars..but cant give 5 because of being disppointed at getting a defective one.I will update this review after I get the new one and see how it does.///////////////// OK, I RECIEVED THE NEW CAMERA. //////////////////////////////////////And have been using, also purchased the battery grip for it and extra batteries.First, the new one is great.  No problems and I dont have the error with it and my EF lenses. Though the weather hasnt permitted much outdoor photography for me, I was able to attend the photoshoot that I had had scheduled and because of Amazons wonderful service, I was able to use my new camera.  And it performed as I had nticipated.  It is as good or better than any of my other canon cameras. I am going to upload some photos shortly taken with this new camera.  Its a good camera.  Fast, sharp and easy to use. The controls take a little getting used to as placement is some different from my older canons. But once I was familiar with them it didnt take long to change settings or to switch modes or whatever I wanted to do.//////////////////Another Update //////////////////////////////////Been using it even more.  And the error code 1 has begun appearing again.  And after alot of discussions with Canon support, it seems that this new camera is not going to be compatible with so-called 3rd party lenses.  Right folks, if you have Sigma or Tamron lenses or otherss for the EOS system, then there is a good chance they might not work on this new camera.  Just wondering if this is planned?  Now in order to use this camera, I have to buy new lenses.  I have Sigma lenses and only one canon lense.  My sigma lenses arent cheap ones either.  So now, only canon lenses will work.  Not what I liked to hear.  Makes we wonder why.  Of course, its obvious when you consider the cost of 3rd party lenses compared to buying a canon brand lense.  3rd party leanses are alot cheaper in cost and at little difference in quality.More I find out, the more I am disappointed in this camera. I still like it, but am NOT happy at having to buy lenses just to be able to use it now. Not the camera, but Canon. Sigma is being great and as a long time customer is allowing me to trade my old lenses for new ones.  Still going to be out more money, but now where near as much as I would have//////////////////////////////// NEW UPDATE //////////////////////////////////Have gotten my new Sigma lens. Used it extensively testing it the last few days. It works perfectly.  No problems and am really happy with the images.  Very bright and color saturation is good.  Photos look great. I print mine on a Kodak printer which I am very happy with. My small prints anyway.  I have larger ones done by a specialty shop.Regardless, the problems seem to stem from the camera and older 3rd party lenses being incompatible in some way.  New technology...??  Very possible.  And likely designed in by canon.  They will fix any canon lenses to work with the newer cameras.  So what the change was...who knows.  I do know that Sigma does stand behind their lenses.  They have a program for long time customers, so if you experience problems, like I did, get in touch with them.  You will not be disapponted. Just dont expect something for nothing.  I didnt...and I love my new lense.                    I purchased this camera mainly for recording video.  Its quality is amazing, and the on-board mic records great to me as well.  For anyone wondering about the new HD digital movie zoom, I created a video demonstrating its quality and the microphone quality as well!  Its on youtube.  Just search for t3i digital zoom and onboard mic test.  Check it out and let me know what you think in the comments!On a side note, I would not recommend purchasing the Patriot LX series 32gb class 10 SDHC card.  I ordered one of these from newegg and when I received it, it did not work properly with the camera due to old firmware on the card.  Patriot has confirmed this over the phone, as the issue started with the T2i.  Apparently they fixed it in there new cards, but old ones are still out there!  I did order the Transcend 32gb class 10 and it is currently working fine at the moment.I Highly recommend getting a wireless remote.  I picked up a brand called Shoot, here on amazon and works great for videos as well if you do not have anyone to operate the camera for recording.Also the battery grip here on amazon fits perfect on the T3i and gives it a nice solid feel and increases stabilization.  Link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QZ6SIY                    I'm not worthy to be a serious reviewer of this product, as I'm just learning what all the photo jargon means.  Let me just say excellent professional looking shots are pretty easy with this camera, and I highly recommend it to anyone thinking of purchasing an SLR camera.  I love the 18-135mm lens, as I'm usually just taking pictures of my wife and kid with it, seems as if I don't need any other lens.  Maybe just a nifty 50 and a separate flash for simple bounce/diffused shots. No regrets on spending the premium for the lens or the newest model! Woohoo, new hobby!

Scroll down just below the description of the camera and you will find this verbiage........&#34;Purchase This Camera and Take Advantage of Any or All of the Following Promotions. Free camera bag, 16 GB memory card, monopod, and up to $300 off select Canon lenses.&#34;These items are all free (EXCEPT THE LENSES) but the discounts on the lenses are HUGE. Don't miss out on the freebies if your spending the money on the camera. It is easy to miss and is not offered again in your shopping cart. Look the camera page over good. You'll find the offer.                    I researched several SLR's before deciding on the Canon T3i.  I'm happy with my choice so far, having purchased the camera first of all to take high quality photos of fairly small works of sculpture art, using the Canon 60mm macro lens.  For that use, the camera and lens seem to work very well.  I find the ergonomic arrangement of controls on the camera to very very intuitive and pleasant to use.  The camera feels solid and is easy to hold with the very adequate right hand grip that has a rubberized cover allowing the user to maintain a firm grip.  The menu system for adjusting camera settings is also well designed and easy to use. The adjustment wheel just behind the shutter button makes changing settings very simple when in manual mode. I especially like the articulated LCD screen on the back of the camera that allows it to be positioned so that otherwise very awkward camera positions (ie, overhead, or low to the ground) are easily possible.  The view finder is very clear and has all basic settings info on the bottom border.  The camera comes with a comfortable, good quality neck strap and is quite light and small compared to other SLRs. Battery life seems to be very good - longer than I expected.  The included corded battery charger will appeal to some, but not to those who prefer the travel type charger with a swing-out plug.  This is not a professional level SLR, but it performs very well as a small, light APS-C camera.                    Honestly, if you are tempted to use the t3i for video, then you have probably (certainly :) ) read the t4i reviews as well. Luckily if you are weighing up which one is better its really simple because one has a "killer" feature and the other hasdifferent "killer" feature. You just have to chose which one you want..I'll tell you what is , if it's useful just click my review as helpful..Oh go on then, I'll tell you anyway :)Up until this camera came along I used an hd camcorder for my video and a dslr for my bird photography. This camera along with the 70-300mm lens means "one camera does all". This is because the t3i has a 3x zoom with no loss in quality and really without pixel peeping that is pretty much true.In a nutshell the newer t4i with the newer sensor and the "autofocus" loses this feature...mmm If you are are even contemplating filming on safari, or birds in you're bag yard getting a 900mm lens with your 300mm lens is just too useful to lose.The video quality is great but you need to work at it. Its certainly not as easy to use as a dedicated camcorder but the results can be better.So if you're thinking of getting the t3i, reading the reviews, comparing it to the 6t4i and countless others you're probably pulling your hair out at all the pros and cons? Am I close. I'm a photographer and have used this, the t4i and its sony equivalent.But herein lies the real point of this camera and the t4i and the others. You know its the person behind the camera that takes the pictures but do you really know it? This and the t4i take pictures so good (if you have the skill) you could blow it up the size of front door but are you going to want to. The thing no sellers want to tell you is that for years, maybe 5 , all of the big names have been making great dslr. Since the nikon d40 perhaps. But you really want to know, if you bought this, would you be happy or buying a pup?. Be reassured that neither canon, nikon or sony make chocolate teapots. They know how to make a great camera and this is one.So the photos will be great and its a great camera, you've read other reviews so I won't duplicate what you have already read but one thing you may not have read is about the video. All the makers have got dslr right. No pups in sight, but video is a relatively new feature and Sony have tbh been leading the way. This camera sets to rectify that.It doesn't have autofocus but a lot of places on the net, say it's not needed, you should be using manual focus. That's nonsense. Manual focus is ok at times but can be a pain. Filming your dog on the beach for example..You could go for the autofocus on the t4i is actually pretty good. Not as good as a camcorder but pretty good. The slowest part is for it to get going. But when it's locked on its sound. Well worth having. So thats sorted right..err no, not really. This is the t4i 's killer feature. Trouble is, they left out the killer feature from this t3i. The 3x zoom with "no loss in quality". So here is the choice if you are buying this for video.if you want you're 300mm zoom to be able to zoom to 900mm for filming sport or wildlife. It's the t3i for youIf you love the idea of autofocus (or hate the idea of doing it the old fashioned way) its the t4i for you.In my opinion if you're considering the other makes like Sony, it comes down to who makes the the lens you are likely to want. I know I have focused (terrible pun intended)  about video but hey, there has been thousands of photo reviews already about iso , shutter speed etc etc. Nothing for me to add there!One more thing I forgot to mention (and yes it is regarding the video) is that to get great video you need to use the right settings in the menu.Unfortunately these are counter intuitive and if you don't use them you may be under whelmed. This is helpful, So if you are considering using it for video here are a few "must have" things you might  need to go with it.Make better videos with your dslr or camcorderVelbon DV7000 3-Section Ultra Heavy Duty Tripod with Geared Center Column, 2-Way Fluid Head and QB-6RL Quick Shoe, Max Height 64-inch, Supports 9.9 lbsRode VideoMic Directional Video Condenser Microphone w/MountSo now I have spent ten minutes typing away, telling you how I like the t3i for video (I do) do me a little favour and click that you find this helpful. Unless you don't. Either way you will enjoy this camera .. We live in good times to take photos as there are so many great cameras and this is definitely one of them.  If anyone wants them, comment and I will try to post a linkI have done lots of tests and made quite a few films with this camera just do a search on youtube for alex sally and you'll find my channel. I have also found what I think is the best setting to use to get a natural look.If you intend using it for video you will need a tripod for sure and probably an external mic. if you want to get the best from it.I'm joking that as a camera "it's ok" . The camera part has been reviewed fully on here and lets be honest no dslr in this price bracket by any make isn't capable of producing great results and this one is no different.Happy shooting..                    I've been a Canon customer since 1978, when I bought the 35mm Canon A-1, and I've had a Canon SLR ever since. Getting the new flagship model every three or four years was something I did for a long time, but when D-SLRs came along, I began downsizing after the EOS 1Ds I got in 2004. In 2007 I moved to EOS 40D and, although losing the full-size sensor was a sacrifice, it was a step in the right direction. With my recent purchase of the T3i, it's another move away from the professional models.Why would I do that? It's not so much the cost of new cameras that has shaped my decisions to downgrade; it's the size. While professional equipment is important to me, so are professional looking photos. And the truth is, after the newness wears off a D-SLR, I tend frequently to leave the big gun behind and rely on an advanced compact or ultrazoom for most of my shooting. As a result, I have more point-and-shoot pictures than I do pro quality ones.This tendency has ended with the purchase of the T3i. The camera is modestly sized, and I never leave home without it. With the 18-55mm kit lens (very nice little lens for its specs) or 24-105L, it's not any bigger than the Fuji Finepix HS10 I leaned on for most of my shooting this past year. And while the HS10 is hands down the best ultrazoom camera I ever used, the difference in image quality, performance and even video between it and the T3i is night and day.The T3i may not be blazing fast like my 1Ds or the 40D, but 90% of the shooting I do is not that kind of photography, anyway. What the T3i excels at is image quality. I have a whole raft of photos that, eked and tweaked to maximum effect in Photoshop, are only a little better than average because they were taken with a point-and-shoot camera. This camera's image quality, I'm happy to say, is superlative! So are the videos. Rebel T3i is almost too good to be true.An articulating LCD is something I've come to insist upon, and this one is by far the best I've ever used. I don't use Live View every time, but I've certainly been in that mode a lot more frequently with this model than with the 40D! In review mode, the refresh rate is a bit slow when zooming in to look at details, but it's not as slow as reviewing pictures on, say, Panasonic DMC-ZS7. (I did test Canon EOS 60D at Best Buy and noticed that the refresh rate is much faster on that model--perhaps because of the larger battery--but it's really not enough of an issue to deduct a star.)The resolution of the LCD is superb, and because it can be tilted and twisted to advantage, it can be viewed even in strong sunlight.Although the nine-point autofocus system is getting criticism for lagging behind Nikon, focus is swift and accurate. At 3.7 fps, burst mode is cut nearly in half from my 40D's 6.5 fps, but so far this has not hampered my ability to catch fast moving subjects.I appreciate the Lighting Optimizer function and use it a lot under the harsh lighting conditions in the desert where I live. It is of incalculable value.I have yet to haul out the owner's manual, thanks to the on-board guide. Of course it helps that I've owned Canon D-SLRs before, but adjusting settings on this camera is a lot different than on my previous ones. There have been some settings I would have normally needed to consult a manual for, but it hasn't been necessary because the answers are in-camera. (I never shoot in Auto, by the way. I'm a manual mode kinda gal.)Because images are very clean up to ISO 1600 and are usable even at ISO 6400, taking along the Speedlight flash so far has not been necessary. Yet another plus with this Canon iteration.There's something about blown highlights that really sets my teeth on edge, but that has not been a problem, thanks to the T3i's Highlight Tone Priority function. Dynamic range is very good to excellent, even a hair better than my 40D. Colors are more accurate, too. I prefer the contrast one stop under the camera's default setting, which is, admittedly, fairly punchy and will result in a blown highlight here and there. Reducing contrast just a tad fixes that.Eighteen megapixel resolution is outstanding.Sometimes I think about the EOS 60D's speedier performance, more advanced autofocus system and that wonderful electronic level and wonder if I made the right choice. But then I remember the heft and bulk of that camera and all the times I've left my SLR at home for those very reasons, and I know the T3i was the right decision. I really, really like this new camera--and I take it everywhere!                    Wow.  This camera is amazing.  This is my first dSLR camera and I might as well have never been taking pictures when I had my point-and-shoot.  I wanted a camera that was capable of actually taking useable pictures indoors and also have a touch of zoom on it.  This does both great.  I can't believe the quality and clarity indoors, even at night.  With hardly any lights on it can take crisp photos with ease.  I was able to zoom across a dimly lit 40-foot room, use the flash, and read the serial numbers off my camera's box!  Amazing.The standard flash seems to work pretty well.  I'll probably get an external flash eventually, but the one it comes with works great.  Seems to be pretty powerful.  I haven't tested it outside at night yet, though.I've only played with the video capabilities briefly.  You set it up by finding your focus point and then roll from there.  It keeps the focus well and only small adjustments are needed when depth in your focused subject changes.  Might take a little work knowing when and how to change the focus during some action shots but eventually the non-autofocus throughout the video could end up being a positive rather than a negative due to customizing capabilities.The camera seems solid, but very light.  I couldn't believe the difference between this camera and my dad's 60D (which had a smaller lens on his as well).  It seems significantly lighter.  I thought this was a great feature since I'll probably use the camera a lot on the go.The functions of the camera make sense.  While I'm just a beginner, there seems to be a lot of room to learn with the camera.  The ease of use is easy enough for my wife to follow without having to learn all the intricacies to shooting a manual shot.  Yet all the manual capabilities are there when you want it.The live view screen is large, bright, and crisp.  Very easy to read in any light setting.Overall, I LOVE the camera.  While I would probably love any dSLR just coming from a point-and-shoot, the features of this camera are what attracted me to it.  It is light, powerful, and easy to use with flexibility to grow.  With such a powerful sensor for pictures and 1080p video capabilities, I feel this camera will be in my bag for many years to come.                    I have had the camera 2+ days. Finally upgraded from standard point-and-shoot. The camera is awesome so far. Very happy with the purchase, and look forward to learning about better photography.Recommended as a first-time DSLR, the T3i has ample features. There is so much to do with this camera. As soon as I learn one feature, it's on to the next exciting one. Takes gorgeous photographs. Just last night, I took some outstanding low-light shots that were exciting for a newbie like me, and would not have been do-able with a standard point-and-shoot.I really like the swivel on the live view when doing video clips, which was another reason I chose this camera over competitive models. You can use the live view to shoot stills as well, but I'm trying to learn the manual features and the viewfinder to get better acquainted with the camera. Just an FYI, you will need an SDHC card with a Series 6 rating or higher to do video. You can get a 16GB card on Amazon for a reasonable price.The stock lens seems to be fine as I am learning to use the camera. I plan on upgrading the lens once I get more comfortable with it. Again, there are some good values on Amazon for Canon lenses (just search 'Canon Lens' and you'll see the most popular buys).In closing, I took a long time to research and decide whether or not getting into a DSLR was worth it for me. Having now made the purchase, I can say without hesitation that it was well worth the money. Especially for a beginner like me, the T3i is a great camera.                    I looked at many items before pulling the trigger on the Canon T3i. I went to Best buy and tested out the Canon T2i, the Nikon D5100, the Canon 60D, and the Nikon D7000. After testing out all the products I came to the decision that the only cameras I liked that felt good in my hand were the Canon T2i, Nikon D5100 and the Can T3i. I went for the T3i over the T2i because of the articulating LCD screen. I personally preferred the Canon T3i over the Canon T2i because of that one reason only, which is not a huge deal. The reason I chose the T3i over the Nikon D5100 was because of video manual focus on the Canon and also the Nikon D5100 does not have a built-in focus motor. I am sure the Nikon D5100 is a spectacular camera and it sports a larder image sensor than the Canon. I just felt in my opinion that the Canon T3i was the best deal at $789.99 with the lens kit.I took the camera out to the beach and tested it and was amazed by the Canon T3i quality. I literally took a picture of a surfer 75 Yards away with the kit lens, and was able to zoom in, in Photoshop and crop an up close beautiful detailed picture of the surfer. The quality is amazing I am upgrading from a Canon XSI and love it. I also took a picture of a cherry tree that was about 30 yards away, and then opened it up in Photoshop, zoomed in, and could see cherries that I could not even see with my eyes from the spot where I took the picture. I can not wait to get Canon 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 EF-S Zoom Lens and than I will be in some serious business.                    Like many other interested purchasers I struggled making the decision to go with the T3i. I'm definitely glad I opted for this camera. The most noticeable feature, the articulating LCD, is far more than a little add-on to me, since I have an issue with positioning myself to use a fixed position live view, much less the viewfinder when the camera is in some locations. The ability to use an external mic for stereo video sound is another great feature. The available settings & options seem nearly limitless to me at this point. Among the many other highlights is the quality of the 18 MP resolution. Since I just received the camera a week ago, I plan to update this review when I have more time with it.I went from a Canon XTi to this model and the transition has been totally AWESOME. I would strongly recommend the T3i to all of my friends.                    I could go on and on about the picture quality of the DSLR, but I'm sure anyone looking to buy one already knows about all those things.  I will instead focus on the camera itself (the hardware/software) instead of the picture quality, which is SUPERB.PROS:The sheer amount of features allowed is nice.  As my first DSLR, I can only judge this camera against point and shoots.Everything can be tweaked and tuned as expected in a DSLR, but it also has a "auto" mode, which is nice when you just want to take a quick shot and not have to worry about ISO settings, etc, etc.The shutter itself feels much better than a point and shoot, and the focus time, and the downtime between shots is also WAY lower than the run of the mill point and shoot.A feature I haven't seen as flexible in point in shoot is the timer shots.  You can set it to take anywhere from 1-10 pictures with 1 timer.  This is great for big family photos where you prop the camera up on a tripod and just want to do 10 photos in a row - and hopefully everyone will have their eyes open in one of those 10 photos (especially hard with little kids).CONS:The software/hardware feels sort of undated.  Canon has stuck with this same layout for a long time for continuity, but new point and shoots have a much more streamlined interface.  For example, the wheel on the top (where you switch between modes), does not allow for 360 degree rotation, only like 300 degrees rotation.  This means, for example, if you were in Video Capture mode and wanted to go to Macro Mode, you have to spin the wheel 300 degrees instead of just 60 degrees.The software is one that takes getting used to.  They use a "tab" system to tell you which settings you are messing with in the Menu.  The tab system may be familiar to long time Canon users, but the way the tabs are labeled sometimes make it confusing.  Instead of using words, they use symbols, which I feel do not match well.  For example, there are "tabs" with a Wrench icon.  Unless I memorize which setting is where, there is a hard time remember exactly what settings are changed in the "wrench" tab.The battery must be charged separately from the device.  I don't know if this is a standard for DSLR, but I liked how I could just plug in my camera itself and charge it on point and shoots.Overall:There is no arguing the picture quality, it is basically the same as the T2i, and professional reviews all across the internet rate this as the top entry-level DSLR.  It has settings for a beginner like me, and it has settings for advanced users as well.For those wondering between T2i and T3i, the main difference is a spin-out LCD screen, and digital zoom during video.  These differences are small, and I know I was confused when I first researched this DSLR.  The T2i and T3i are much more similar than the T3 vs T3i.T2i or T3i - Get either, T3/T2 are a lower-end model, they are made for two different budget targets.                    Hopefully this will help someone who is undecided between the Canon T3i and the 60D. I last used a 35mm SLR about 15 years ago. I was used to being able to quickly and easily adjust aperture, iso and shutter speed. Since then I've used a progression of Canon digital point and shoots. When I got the T3i I was expecting a similar experience to my SLR days, but was sorely disappointed. To make changes with the T3i, you have to navigate through a difficult to use menu one the LCD display. With the 60D you're able make those changes much more easily without using the LCD menu. The small screen on top of the camera is a big help and displays the current settings. Otherwise the two cameras are capable of taking the same quality photographs.If you can, I would suggest trying both cameras out and seeing which you're more comfortable using.Pros for the 60D: Change settings more quickly, longer battery lifeCons for the 60D: Heavier and more expensivePros for the T3i: Lighter and less expensive.Cons for the T3i: More difficult to navigate menu and change settings, also shorter battery life
!###Ordered this camera, but UPS decided to leave it out side during bad weather. When i returned home that night, i check my tracker and it said its delivered! But lo and behold theres nothing on my property. SO! after contacting the seller, UPS and Amazon about the package, UPS calls me up and begins to attack me over the phone and then begins to harrass me for 2 weeks over the package. Did i even get a "Im sorry for your inconvenience"? No i get screamed at over the phone by thier customer service and how they are going to mess with my future shipments and make it more difficult for me.Now I have used other models like this camera. Compared to the 7D unless your a professional photographer, than the T3i is the camera to go with. has the same processor as the 7D so using it for film is awesome. Stock lenses are ok but try to go for an upgrade, you will see the quality difference. T3i has a plastic body which is sturdy and lighter than the 7D. For beginner photographers this is the camera to start with and one you will use well into your advancement                    Its one of the best camera for professionals.I'm waiting for the order to arrive, pretty existed and happy that finally i could afford to get the best camera in the market.                    I have used Canon cameras since the original Canon 35mm Rebel and its' successsors. I started digital with the original Canon Eos Digital, and upgraded with the Rebel T3i. 18MP is nothing to sneeze at this camera will give you professional level images IF you take the time to learn how to use it. I know. for most it just turning the knob to the green zone and shooting away, get a point and shoot for that and save a lot of bucks.                    Great Camera. Unfortunatly I bought two of the same cameras, one here and one from another company and had to return one. the other company tried to charge me a 300 dollar restocking fee. this company gave me a full refund. Great customer service. Would recommend making your purchases here. Also my t3i works wonderfully!                    Camera was in good shape that was what ! expect,  very please with it.Sergio. I trust I trust Amazon.com but some times is a flat tire                    Apesar de estar iniciando no mundo da fotografia, consigo fazer fotos excelentes com esta m&aacute;quina. F&aacute;cil de usar, corpo resistente, gravação de v&iacute;deo impressionante! Vale cada centavo!                    I bought this item as a gift recently brand new from Amazon. When I got the Item, the box was not sealed, everything inside the box appeared to be used. It seems as thought they sold me an item that had been returned or something. When I am spending this kind of money for an item such as this I expect it to be brand new. This is absolutely ridiculous. I was very embarassed to give this as a present to my friend but due to time constraints i had no choice. I am am amazon prime member and I expect alot more especially when I buy an item brand new via Amazon Prime. I am really disappointed and afraid to buy high priced items via amazon Prime. Clearly the high standard that amazon once had is dropping....BEWARE.                    Bought this model for my wife for Christmas. Out of the box had problems with keeping battery charged. Also, could not access the menu or get any displays on the screen. Called Canon support, by the way was very good, after a few words the support person said  it had a problem. The way the support person knew of this problem, sounded to me this was a common failure. Was recommended to send it back.  Now I have questions as to whether to purchase a Canon if the quality assurance at Canon is performing their jobs.                    Does this camera come with a battery? I'm seeing it says Lithium ion battery required. I NEED THIS CAMERA IN MY LIFE!!! I've been looking and saving up for this since it first came out...

!###I am so disappointed in the Canon decision not to support the older Powermacs with the newer software. The T3i bundled  software on the DVD will NOT run on an older Powermac, such as the G5's, which a LOT of us still use. Now, to use the T3i, an Intel powered Mac is required. What are they thinking?The software from the older Canon XTi for example, runs fine on a Powermac so you can use the "Live View" function while shooting live in a light-box. Before you point out that there is a "Live View" button on the T3i, let me just say there is no comparison looking at an image on a 24" inch screen.So the fix is to go with an inexpensive Window PC with XP Pro instead of investing in any more Macs and use the PC as a stand-alone station with the light-box. The cost comparison is astounding.Jesse                    I have not had much time to really try this out yet but since I am an avid Canon owner I have no doubt that this camera will be just as great as all the rest that I have owned! I really love the live view the T3i has.I have made several purchases from Amazon and have always received prompt service and received the merchandise on or before it was promised.Yes, I would definitely reccommend this purchase to anyone.                    Well, I couldn't afford the whole kit so I tried the camera with a borrowed 28-90 lens, and this is the outcome: [...]  I also made this one: [...]Photos are huge!I'm very happy :D                    Is a great camera!But each day I agree more with the Idea.&#34;The best camera, is the one you can bring with you all the time&#34;                    I bought the T3i with 18-135mm lens to replace a Rebel XT. I have 2 other Canon lenses and wanted something that would work with those. I also wanted a lens with enough range that I don't have to switch lenses as often.The T3i is nice, a little more complicated than the XT. I would prefer that it does NOT take video but that isn't an option.My only complaints about the T3i is that the power switch is in the same place as before, and so I still may accidentally move the mode dial when turning it on/off, which can result in improperly exposed pictures. Also, I still haven't figured out the best settings for the autofocus, it still seems sort of hit-or-miss.The T3i body worked fine with my other Canon lenses.However, this kit had an 18-135mm lens that seemed to work fine. But then when I looked at the images on my computer, the focus is soft. When I zoomed in to Actual Pixels view in Photoshop, the images are not crisp. They are not really "blurry", but not as sharp as images from my Canon older lenses.I am returning this and getting just the T3i body.                    This is a great camera - no question. I was, however, appalled to find that when the autofocus became faulty after only 6 months the company expected me to ship it insured at my expense for repair - having spent $799 on Canon products in this bundle, I thought this was a pretty low way to treat a customer who had lost many pictures as a result of this error on a piece of equipment only 6 months old.                    I have wanted a camera for sometime now and at first I loved this camera but I am starting to get a little annoyed with it! When it works it takes great pictures but more and more it is saying busy and taking a minute before I can take another! & it will not completely focus. You can hear it trying to focus but my pictures will be fuzzy, I have to release the button and try it several times to make it work. I will be contacting Canon A.S.A.P. because several of my family members have the rebel t2 and they have no issues at all with canon so it seems like I just got the random defective one :(                    I am an experienced still photographer, beginning to shoot movies. I already had a Nikon D5100 and love it. I needed a second camera for moviemaking and decided to try the EOS Rebel T3i, so I bought one and have been using it for a couple of months alongside the Nikon. It's okay for full-motion HD video, with somewhat more control over exposure than the Nikon.For still photography, it sucks. One of the motivations for a DSLR instead of a pocket digital camera is the expectation that the DSLR will take the picture when you press the button. The Canon T3i doesn't. The Nikon always does. This difference is infuriating. Any decent photographer knows when to take the picture. If the camera waits a couple of milliseconds--or full seconds, in the case of the Canon T3i--you can't capture the moment.It's also cheaply made, compared with the Nikon--all kinds of minor shortcuts to reduce the cost.I'm not sorry I bought it, but I am more than a little disappointed and will use the Nikon as my primary camera, with the Canon as a backup for movies, and leave it in the camera bag when I am shooting stills.                    I like this camera, I really do...it's just more than I need.  My profession requires me to take quality photos of properties and this definitely delivers.  But for the price I paid, it offers way more features than I'll ever use.                    Hi,Does anyone know why my pictures are all of a sudden coming out distorted? This is the Rebel T3i. I haven't dropped my camera, or spilled anything on it. I can't understand why all of a sudden my images are coming out like this. I am using a Transcend 32GB memory chip if that has anything to do with it. I have nothing else to test this theory though. Does anyone know off hand what it could be? Sorry for the slideshow too. I just wanted to get these pix up and see if anyone else was having similar problems. Transcend 32 GB Class SDHC 10 Flash Memory Card TS32GSDHC10E Well since Amazon doesn't leave me a choice to upload images. Here is the link to view the distorted pix... please help! I am not familiar with SLR and have never had this problem with all my digital cameras.[...]
!###I bought this as a first digital SLR. I've been holding out, because I still love my Canon EOS Rebel X film camera, which I've used for many years and is still going strong. I'm very happy with this camera, as it takes great pictures & accepts the zoom lenses from my EOS Rebel X.                    After taking a digital photography class at my high school, I began to have urges to take pictures all of the time. I'd learned Adobe Photoshop backwards and forwards, but didn't have a good enough camera for my most artistic desires. Thus came the Canon EOS Rebel T3i into my life. I don't know too much about cameras besides the basics like aperture, exposure, and ISO, but I have taken some amazing pictures with this camera. My photos are crisp, clear, sharp, and professional-looking. I'm also a video nerd, and it takes some great shots with the depth of field that you can't get with your average video camera. Overall, this was a great first DSLR and I look forward to using it for many years to come.                    The T3i is my first DSLR but I have owned many SLRs in the past so I would consider myself a low intermediate user.  This camera is just what I needed in my budget and I can not be more pleeased.  So far, I have taken over 2,000 shots in the first month of use and I am still happy with my buy.  I needed something that was not just a point and shoot as also take photos of still life for website design and galleries.  I even took shots of old photos and made posters out of them.  Great detail capture.  The menu is quick to set up and switch between formats when I need to.  I bought the body separate from the lens and I prefer to spend my money on a solid 2-3 lens.                    So I am a budding photographer - but I have been using an XTi since it was the top camera in its class. That XTi is now 6 years old, doing well but has seen better days. I got this boy as my upgrade - knowing the price would be lower given the T4i's debut. I know its not the latest and greatest and I know its sort of a 60D knock off, but you seriously cannot beat the price seen here for a camera like this. 18.8 MP, 1080P HD Video... match these up w/a 50mm fixed and you have an amazing amazing detail and lovely camera. I am so happy! My next camera will be a 5D in the future... (mk. 6?) lol...LOVE!Oh, I got it on the 3rd day of 2-day shipping b/c of July 4th Holiday, stupid me. Don't care!                    It is an excellent camera but unfortunately does not contain a feature I was looking for. I do no post processing on a computer and rely on the features in the camera.For some reason, they do not have a trimming feature where you cam trim  and record in-camera. Otherwise, a very good camera.                    Disclaimers:I'm not a photographer and I don't use the advanced settings and functions of this or any camera.That said I am a father fo two little boys that are very active in sports and in general.  I use the various quick settings on the dial and go, this camera takes amazing pictures.  I previously owned a Digital Rebel XT which was great as well, but this is far better for a few reasons.  First it is faster to start, it has the adjustable LCD viewfinder, and most importantly shoots HD video.  The video quality is ridiculously good as well AND I only need to carry and operate one camera now.I replaced the kit lens with an EF-S 18-135mm and 55-250mm and with my tripod can take just about any shot and video even at his baseball games.  Combine a battery grip and 32GB memory card and I can get through an entire tournament shooting a ton of pictures and short videos.I bought a killer camera like this BECAUSE I am not a photographer and it allows me to take great pictures and video.I highly recommend this camera to anyone in a similar situation, it has paid for itself many times over already.                    I was actually looking for point and shot camera that has1. Rotating screen2. Large zoom3. Good quality of images taken at day and night4. Good quality video5. Fast performance6. Relatively small size7. Reasonable priceI used to have Canon Pro1, that had everything I wanted, but it was incapable of delivering acceptable images at low light condition. Unfortunately, there are no cameras exist on the today's market that would satisfy above requirements. So, I have bought this Canon T3i  DSLR and have compromised on size and weight. It does everything very well, and produces great images in auto modes. One day I may decide to learn manual modes, if I have have nothing else to do.                    I am long time buyer of Canon DSLR cameras (since the Canos EOS 300D). As aways, canon managed to improve what was already good. The Canon T3i is a great camera.                    The Rebel T3i is an excellent camera if you want good professional photography and professional movie making on a budget. I will note, however, some issues I have run into so you are aware they exist and plan accordingly.MOVIE MAKINGSome people (myself included) get this camera for the ability to shoot 24p, 30p and 60p movies through a large lens into a large sensor, which in the world of pro video cameras would cost you many times more, all the above being equal.POWEROne thing I would like to tell you from the start is that if you get a 6 battery add-on power pack for this camera, plan to use it for photos only. For movies, you will go through a battery magazine in a few minutes!Find the AC adapter to use the camera straight from wall power for movies. Such an adapter is available right here on Amazon to buy separately and it will save you lots of frustration, recharge waiting time and battery costs.FLASH (for photos)The MK off-camera remote flashes are well worth the investment, because they will give you the ability to capture amazing photos by experimenting with lighting, color, exposure and shadows.ENHANCEMENTSYou will focus manually when shooting movies with a DSLR, but that is OK because you want to use this camera especially for movie effects such as close-ups or dialogues while pulling focus. A follow-focus device will help here. They range from a few hundred dollars to a plastic strip with a handle on eBay for $14, and an upcoming "$50 follow focus" Hondo Garage project to be released soon. All the above devices other than the eBay cheap solution will require a $120-300 rig. To make your rig look impressive (if you film for clients) and to enhance your movie making ability, add a matte box that holds filters or at least one that works as a shade.Zebra stripes, HDR, more control, etcOne gray market utility that greatly enhances photo shooting and movie making is a firmware sidegrade called Magic Lantern. I've used it with no glitches.Tripod, dollyThink Ravelli and Peartree, both available here on Amazon.Lights and studio backdropsYou will want a perfect white, black and green background, and the key to success is good and ample lighting. Neweer and Cowboy Studio among others, here on Amazon.By now you're realizing that making movies on a Canon Rebel T3i is neither cheap nor hassle free. However, it beats spending $15,000 for a cinema camera that needs $600 storage media and a $3000 lens.The lens included in this kit (18-55mm) is excellent for most purposes, and appears to be a favorite for making movies. In pictures it has a slight corner distortion at the widest angle setting, which may go unnoticed unless someone's face happens to be there. Overall, considering the awesome savings and the ability to work like a movie director without a Holywood budget, highly, highly recommended.TIPIf you use another camera to capture other parts of your movie, and the T3i just for the high quality portions (close-ups, pulling focus, dialogues, faces, etc) then make sure you shoot at the same frame rate or close (if your other camera is 29.97 / 60i then use this camera at 30p (closest setting) and interpolate the footage from the other one so both are progressive before combining them. Also do a white balance on both cameras right before shooting.TWEAKINGThis Canon (with minor adjustments and a little patience) can match footage shot on most other cameras if you need to work with 2 cameras; at least it matches my Canon and Panasonic pro video cameras close enough so people can't tell that two or more completely different cameras were used.CONCLUSIONExcellent deal for photographers; a godsent for indie movie makers.                    After purchasing the camera, I never thought I would ever use the video recording function even though it has the capabilities of recording in full 1080HD. But then I was asked to help out with a school video project, a campaign called I Love HC. Needless to say, I decided to use my T3i. The quality is awesome. Here is a link to the video so you can see for yourself! [...]
!###This item was rated &#34;Like New&#34;. It arrived with caked on dirt and was missing both the battery and charger. Was not worth the discounted price. Once we hunted down the charger and battery we ended up spending more than if we would have bought new from other retailers or even from Amazon. Extremely disappointed.                    hi, , the new Sony NEX-5N is now giving the T3i Canon a powerful contender for less money. Pity there aren't enough lenses for it but that could change soon.The Canon T3i comes with the perfect lens in the market, far better than the D5100 kit lens. The Nikon kit lens is a soft lens.                    Pros:Amazing machine for the money. Has a lot of advanced features. Pretty good for closeup and mid range pictures, no need to keep on switching lenses. One is able to take high quality photos on the fly. Color and contrast are excellent. Overall, I would definitely recommend itCons:The camara has difficulty focusing when the LCD is used for picture taking. The machine is not reliable on Video mode, the recording keeps on being automatically stopped after a few second. Needs multiple attempts to have a continuous recording. The camera has difficulty putting the right contrast on the subject if the background is bright despite using different modes.                    This Rebel T3i has some great specs for such a great price! Features: 18 MP "larger than normal-CMOS sensor" and "DIGIC 4 Image processor" picture quality ~ Nikon can't touch this currently. A 3" vari-angle Hi-Res LCD viewer - which makes it EZ for front viewing/composing or recording Full-HD video from the front of the camera and/also for overhead viewing while composing picts. HD recording video has zoom capabilities--unheard of before! Shoots 3.7 frames per second in continuous mode; right around half of what the 60D does at half the price! Shoots such great photos, you just need minimal--IF ANY--Ps editing! This kit even comes with a Canon high quality, wide angle 18-55 MM Image Stabilizing lens! Auto-mode analyzes and adjusts for excellent picts with no effort on your part. Of course, there are the usual pict-taking settings (P, Av, Tv, Macro, Portrait, Landscape, etc and Manual). You can't go picture-wrong with the goods packed in this kit!!                    This is the third Canon digital camera I've owned. There's a reason I keep buying them. They do what I need. This time I wanted high resolution and really high zoom capability. This has it. I can't believe how much better my pictures look with this camera than my last Powershot.                    This is my first SLR cam, I was planning to buy the T2i after so many researches, but when I saw that t3i was released, I went for it, and I know I have done the right choise. The moving LCD screen is so useful, and the Auro mode is very smart that can be close to manual settings. I recommend it for new Photographer as its very easy to deal with.                    Item is excellent and worth buying Site FUNThe strongest shopping site in the worldThank youS s s                    Love this camera. It takes great pictures. It is fast. Now all I need to do is learn how to work Photoshop.                    this is a great camera. have not had it long but love everything about it so far. even my wife loves the fact i got it.                    La resolucion muy buena, lo mejor a diferencia de las otras rebel ( exluyendo la t4i) es la pantalla flexible a parte de todos los features que tiene
!###I make video Documentary Films, I have worked with the Canon 7d, canon 60d and with the T3i. In video quality and functionality the 3 cameras provide me the same. In my personal opinion i like the t3i the most. The price is a good reason to buy this camera, but also this camera is smaller and lighter (maybe more fragile at the same time). But so far does the job and never cease to impress me. My recommendation is to spend the money in better lens and not in expensive cameras like the 7D ( FOR VIDEO PORPOISES)                    I'm a film student and was trying to decide between a t3i and Nikon 5100. everyone tells me that Nikon has a better lenses, but when it comes down to it you can buy any lens for your camera. the 600d has better continuous recording, you have better manual capabilities. after a lot research i decided to go with the canon, i went with a t3i and not a t2i for the flip around screen. i shoot in awkward positions sometimes and it defiantly comes in handy. i would recommend this camera over any one on the market and shoots great in low lighting settings. all the controls fit my hand nicely and it feels natural. my favorite thing is the dedicated iso button making it easy to change quickly.                    I haven't even had a month with the T3i yet and already I can tell it was money VERY well spent. As many of you are probably doing now, I had to decide which brand, then which model to pick. It was a tough choice, for the longest time I was trying to decide between the Nikon D3100 and the Canon T2i, but for just a little bit more, you get a nice flip-out high resolution screen, remote flash firing, and a few other goodies with the T3i. I'm not a photographer. In fact, I had absolutely no interest in photography until just recently. This is my first DSLR camera, and it's perfect for me. it has enough settings and features so I won't become easily bored, or "grow out" of it, yet it has a great feature guide that tells you what each mode should be used for (fully customizable of course). The 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Image Stabilized (IS) Kit lens that it comes with is perfect for getting used to the camera. It's good for those relatively close up group shots, or portraits. Even very small subjects can be brought into focus with this lens. And when your'e ready to upgrade, the 55-250mm IS lens is very reasonably priced (that's what I plan to get next anyway). I would recommend getting a SanDisk Extreme SD card to go with this (at least 8gb). OH! one last thing, the HD movie mode. That was another huge selling point for this camera. Although the Nikon D3100 AND the Canon T2i both have 1080p HD video recording, they do NOT have inputs for an external microphone. For some this might not be a big deal at all, but it's always a nice thing to have if you should want to dabble in the cinematography world in the future.Overall, GREAT camera, I would recommend it to anyone.                    I got the Rebel T3i because I'm going into photography and thought it would be a great starter. It is FANTASTIC! I got it ahead of schedule from Amazon, got the free backpack, filter and SDHD card free and it all worked! It was a serious gift to get the camera when I did, because I was doing some serious shooting that day and my Cannon point and shoot just didn't cut it.About the camera:-Its a Cannon, I would never use a different brand, ever. Its functions are mind-blowing! There are complaints about flash, how it was made with cheap plastic and all that nay-saying but if you're going to spend your money, get this camera!-Best pictures I've ever gotten. For someone who takes as many pictures as I do, quality is important.-I thought it would be heavy or difficult to use, but in an hour I had it mastered, and I think my point-and-shoot is heavier.-The 18-55mm lens is excellent, and I can't wait to purchase more.Bottom Line:Shell out the money, get the 18MP version, and never take bad pictures again!                    This is our first DSLR camera and it's a great on for beginners. It's easy to open and start using right out of the box, but there are also plenty of features to play with and learn about as we go.                    The product was packaged very nicely and arrived on schedule. Camera clicks great photos with visible difference as compared to my non SLR camera. Great product and easy to use                    I've had my T3i for six months now, and so far I'm extremely pleased with my results.  I'd call myself at least a semi-professional, having had 10 different digital camera since my first (a Kodak DC120 that cost $1,000) in 1998, including a number of Nikons and Canons.  There are some very long reviews on this site for the T3i, so I'll spare you the details.  But, I take lots of different digital images (over 6,000 since April with this camera), from action photos of our grandchildren playing in their basketball and volleyball games to macrophotographs (using a Canon 100mm macro)of flowers and other organisms, and I'm almost always amazed by the results - images are sharp and colors are right on.  And a number of times folks around me looking at the results have commented on "how amazing" the images are.  Videos have also been lots of fun to take, although the learning curve for getting good video is a little steeper than for still images.  And honestly, if I were going to take very much video, I'd get a dedicated video camera.  This camera, as one might expect, is very versatile, and the important lesson I learned early on is to read the book and go to the internet for advice on how to get the most out of it - some fantastic information there.  Practice, experiment, practice, experiment, etc., and not surprisingly, the more you do the better images you'll get. Common sense I know, but it is tempting and easy to simply set the camera on Scene Intelligent Auto setting and click away, expecting the best (and actually getting a lot when you do).  I rarely use that setting, choosing rather to mostly use the Program AE mode and customize my image taking to the situation.  I could go on and on, but I don't think you'll be sorry if you get a T3i.  It's worth the money!                    I just got this camera and I'm in love with it!  This is my first DSLR (I have several 35mm SLR) and it is so easy to use.  the menus are self explanatory.  I was suprised by how lightweight it is compared to the Nikon D5100. I'm a Nikon person so the D5100 was my first choice.  I played with my friend's D5100 and I found the menus and settings somewhat confusing compared to the Canon T3i.  I love using it for video too and I love that you can take stills while filming.  I chose the Canon because I already had other Canon lenses and because the price was right.  I was second guessing my choice until I received my camera and was blown away by how great the pictures came out and by the ease of use.                    I got the camera body almost overnight and was promised it would arrive in a week to 10 days. I ordered an aftermarket lens by Tamron and I couldn't be happier. I have owned Canons for years and they are always a great mix of latest technology, quality construction, and price.                    I really love this camera. The photos are phenomenal and the features are easy to use. Theres not much I can say about this camera that hasnt been said so I will just say if you buy this camera, you will not be disappointed.
!###I new to SLR family. I want to buy an good camera to explore my photography views..I got confused to choose with t3i or t2i and i finally i decided to go to t3i because it has good video recording mode compare with t2i.                    One of the best in the league. This camera delivers more than the promise. Image quality is superb even in the low light situation. Colors are vibrant as real. An awesome buy for anyone.                    This Camera is awesome, i'm making kids bible video's with it, shooting miniature cardboard marionettes and it is all looking awesome! Thanks!                    Both the T2i and T3i have a serious flaw recording video. When the sensor gets hot, the camera randomly stops. It can be a few seconds, or a few minutes, but neither can be relied upon to record video all the way to the end of the 12 minute clip limitation. Stills are not a problem.                    **ALERT** - I just received my camera today and it is NOT MADE IN JAPAN. Rather I have some flimsy looking camera made in TAIWAN. Can any of the other buyers please confirm their camera body make ??? Thanks !(( I will post a review on the working of the camera, the photo quality etc. once I get out of shock for receiving a non-Japan camera, so 3-stars for now ))How come all of these people have a MADE IN JAPAN Canon T3i ???Look at the T3i's bottom picture to see those magical words "Made In Japan" - Is it possible that Amazon had the Taiwan ones in stock and that is why they are having this clearance deal ?[...][...][...][...][...][...]                    Important differences between Nikon D5100 and Canon T3iD5100 built in wireless flash controller: NOT3i built in wireless flash controller: YESD5100 maximum movie frame rate: 30 fpsT3i maximum movie frame rate: 60 fpsStartup time for D5100: 0.5 secondStartup time for T3i: 0.4 second (if the autoclean function is disabled)Nikon makes battery grip for D5100: NOCanon makes battery grip for T3i: YESD5100 viewfinder: 0.51XT3i viewfinder 0.53XD5100 built in autofocus motor: NOT3i built in autofocus motor: YEST3i LCD has higher resolution than D5100T3i has more adjustment settings than D5100 in movie modeD5100 continuous autofocus ruined some of my movies because it is quite loud and distracting during playbackI returned my D5100 and bought the T3i because of the above differences.  Three stars for d5100 and 5 stars for T3i.                    The lens came without the front cover. And with a scratch on the lens, was the only problem. not returned to amazon that was brought to Brazil in the day following                    - not able to adjust the F-Stop in a simple way. Instead you're reduced to using menus. Don't know about you but I want to be able to quickly switch settings with a flick of a switch or turn of a dial... you know like a real DSLR camera. This severely hurts this camera's use for live practical applications (action, event, wedding). This would be an absolute deal killer for me but I got the camera for free. Otherwise I would've returned it. You shouldn't need manual to understand the basics of a camera in my opinion. It takes a while to get used to... and it's a style of camera I'd rather NOT get used to. Unintuitive. Seriously do not understand CANON's thinking. If I didn't shoot video for a living and if I had the money I would jump ship and stay with Nikon.- This camera is basically a poor man's studio camera that fronts as a easy-to use DSLR. It's not.- Megapixel count is slightly bloated. Again, you only need to extra pixel for editing. I also own a Nikin D90 with only 12M. Similar quality. Way better function! I can get ~299 shots on the Canon Rebel ~199. Wasted memory card space in my opinion.                    I'm having a hard time writing this review.  I've owned my 600d for close to a year, and taken hundreds of photos with it.  This was my first foray beyond point-and-shoots.The main problem I have is the idea of a "consumer" level DSLR.  I've paid several times more for lenses than I did for the camera.  After investing in the glass I find myself wondering why I didn't just get the 5d and been done with it.I guess that's the crux of the matter.  Anyone who would be happy with the basic kit, nifty fifty, and a couple other lenses like the 75-300 would be better served by a bridge camera or superzoom.  Anyone who's willing to outlay the cash for red rings would be better off with the 5d.  I just don't see the purpose for lower end DSLRs as anything more than a stop-gap or learning tool, tasks that could be done just as easily by the 1100d or even, gasp, an old film SLR.On a side note, unless you're at the end of your budget, don't get the 18-55 kit lens.  It will leave you wanting on almost every shot.  Spend a little more on a good prime, even the 40mm f2.8 is a marked improvement over the s*** kit lens.                    Camera was working fine but this week stopped recording close ups or zoomedin images.Still waiting for Canon support to respond.Extremely difficult, as the manualsleave a lot to be desired...
!###Just been 2 day's since I got this but I absolutely love it. Was considering the Nikon D5100 or this and the only thing that convinced me to get this one is the controls. They are easy to get to v/s the nikon and if you want to learn photography, would totally recommend this.                    I finally made the upgrade from standard P&S cameras.  My previous camera was a Panasonic DMC TZ5, a great little camera that even after 3 years is still pretty impressive for it's size.  A little background on me, I work in the film industry as a motion graphics / special effects artist, so my review might be a little skewed towards the video side.  I bought this camera with a 50mm f/1.8 prime lens.When I first picked this up, I was surprised at how lightweight it is.  The older TZ5 is pretty solid but feels almost as heavy as the T3i!  I shot some pictures during the day, played with the awesome depth of field and got some outstanding pictures.  Great contrast, color, white balance, exposure, everything was perfect.  It was actually difficult to get a bad photo even on the more manual settings.Where I was really shocked was low-light performance.  I got pictures I had never thought I could ever get without using the flash.  Even at 3200-6400 ISO I was amazed by the clarity, balance, detail and noise level.  Yes, you can see the noise, but in my humble opinion I actually like a little noise, to me it gives it a little cinematic flare, but that's just me.  But in my old TZ5 I had to severely decrease the shutter speed so much which made it almost impossible to get a clear shot, and even if I could get a clear shot it was either extremely underexposed, white balance was off, or the noise was just too much.  Again the T3i has excelled in every photo I have shot so far (200+).Even more amazing is when shooting 1080p video.  The exact same settings in photo mode will translate directly to video mode with the exact same results on screen.  It is really quite beautiful.  With the TZ5 shooting 720p video, I had to re-adjust the white balance, exposure and aperture for video, and it was still hit-or-miss which was sometimes painfully discovered late after reviewing the footage.  The T3i also has a standard mount and Microphone input and I was able to immediately mount my microphone for great audio.I'm probably a little biased because this is my first DSLR, so I can't really make a comparison with other DSLRs but I am certainly in love with this camera!  The most difficult thing about this camera is trying to decide which shot to choose from as every shot is perfect.                    I recently upgraded to a T4i but this camera is an all around incredible unit! That said, if the cost difference is in your reach, get the T4i instead. The T4i has a much MUCH better focusing system, way better image sensor (much more efficient with light keeps you from upping the ISO) and the WONDERFUL touchscreen! If the budget keeps you here on the T3i, it too is a fantastic camera...mine served me well for a solid year and was only replaced by the T4i!                    I was very much looking forward for this camera for my Video recordings along with photos. Unfortunately, not sure why this camera has lot of hiss in it even with a best quality external mic and it seems there is no fix for it. I would not recommend for videos where audio quality is of most prime importance                    I bought this camera for my Wife because she told me she wanted a Camera that was easy to use and that takes good pictures, I read all of the reviews I could find about the Cannon T3 and the T3i and I felt that the value was there so I bought the T3i. I feel I got a great Camera for a fair price and so far my Wife is still Smiling so I guess I did the right thing.We have taken a few pictures of our 2 German Shepherds and of all of our Grand Children and we plan on taking quite a lot more.I am well pleased with the Quality of the Camera and of the Pictures we have taken.                    I ordered this camera as an additional one to save me constantly switching out lenses.  Most of my photography consists of dogs and nature out kayaking, playing on a beach, or out camping.  I have the Canon T2i, and am thrilled with it all around.  I have two favorite L lenses... the 24 - 70 mm and the 70 - 300.  I also have several primes that I use as well.Since I cannot stand running out of battery, I also use a battery grip.  I recently bought a double harness so I could more easily manage out in the field while using my Rebel with the long lens and my G10 for close or wide angel shots, since I managed to crack the LCD screen on the G10 by carrying them both around my neck.  When it came I realized how off balance it was with one heavy camera and one light so I bought the T3i as an early Christmas gift for myself.I wanted another T2i, because I don't do video OR creative filtering in camera so the changes from the 2 to the 3 didn't appeal to me at all.  I LOVE my T2i, but somehow couldn't justify spending nearly the same amount as the new model cost.The camera came today and I did a few test shots between the two using exactly the same subject, flash, and lens.  I actually have to admit, the ones with the T3i came out obviously ahead of the T2i, even before any editing was preformed.  I was really surprised since I expected them to be exactly the same.I am nervous about the articulated LCD screen breaking off and I wasn't thrilled that the screen doesn't shut off like the T2i did, but I guess both worries are easily solved by keeping it turned around.I do wish Canon would make a STILL camera without the addition of video, but I do understand the appeal of video to some people.  I only used it once with the previous Rebel and I must admit, it was quite good!!!In closing, unless I discover something bad in the next few weeks, I expect this camera will also become a favorite, and congratulate Canon on continuing their great Rebel tradition!!!                    Great camera for a beginner. Works great in still and video modes. The only thing that the description doesn't give any information about is the type of memory card to be used. In the manual, they say Class 6 (6 MBps) or higher. And I have purchased a 32GB Class 6 SDHC card, and it can only record 640x480 30fps video. But lets be honest, you buy an amazing camera with pretty cool features and why do you want to compromise on some feature that degrades the whole purpose of the camera.But anyways, I did some research about HD video recording on DSLRs and found that even though Class 6 SDHC cards work great with the photos, they don't work for HD videos. And the best memory cards suitable for the HD video recording are supposed to be Class 10 (10 MBps) or higher. And following that I also found that in some cases Class 10 (10 MBps) might also not work. And I did further research for find the apt memory card for HD video would require minimum of 30 MBps data rate (45 MBps would be better). But I had to compromise and buy the 30MBps version which is quite costly (about $95).So, if you are buying this camera for a photography purpose its a wonderful and great camera. But provided the memory card is suitable for HD video recording, the video camera also works great!!.I need not give any more info regarding the image quality and other stuff, they are always there for any camera...I would definitely recommend this for a friend!!                    Image Quality:Canon lens, Canon Camera, Canon Quality... what else is there to say?Video Quality:Face it... if all you want to do is create HD video with studio results, you'll be better off with a Canon XH-A1 (or equivalent) as a minimum. But as far as >$1,000 HD cameras go, this is about as good as I've seen for an SD-Card video camcorder. The real bonus is that the recordings have a film look to them compared to the common flat "video look".There are multiple video formats and if you film at the 60 FPS video setting, you can actually produce some cool slow motion effects with a video editing program.Ease of Use:Pros will probably scoff at the large amount of newb presets, but at least everything can be controlled manually. newcomers and hobbiests like myself will like the time-saving presets. Do yourself a favor and read the manual front to back while the battery charges.Low light pictures:Images look great in high, mid, low, and really low light conditions.My only gripe...The Video mode turns off the viewfinder (since light needs to continuously hit the sensor), and the LCD is hard to see in bright daylight, so focusing can be a chore. But this is only a minor gripe.All in all, this is a GREAT camera for the beginner and hobbiest. It's also a very good back up camera for the professional. This is an easy choice to help you transistion from 'snapshot' cameras to professional gear and I've found the video capabilities to be remarkable for a an SD-Card format camcorder.This is a great camera for vacation pics and home movies and all at a great price!UPDATED: (1 Nov, 2011) I need to contradict my earlier review on the video results. This is an incredible camera for capturing 1080P HD video! I have an XH-A1 and after months of shooting video for my company, the T3i consistently outperformed the A1 in video image quality. Better resolution and richer (more accurate) color. Granted the audio isn't on the same level as the A1, but with an external mic, it's records a very clear single channel.                    and I can't quit buying them!! I love my Rebels! The T3i is WONDERFUL!! This camera is so easy to use. It takes great pictures on the auto settings and even better ones when you get creative and use the manual settings. My only complaint is that when I am shooting in live mode some pictures appear blurry and sometimes it took longer for the camera to focus....but that was my first real event with the camera, so hopefully I will figure this out!                    Oh what fun this camera has been! This was such a splurge for me & I don't regret any of it! I am just a normal girl, no experience in photography, and this takes professional photos (ON AUTO!!!) I cannot say enough great things about this! The video quality feels like you are there, the swivel screen is great! The options are endless on this! You will not regret this purchase-promise!
!###Good product that fit my son's needs for making films and videos both action and drama.  Great price for what I received.                    esta camra cumplio con mi expectativas...la he comprado para grabar video mayormente y fotografia eventualmente, graba es full HD y graba en diferentes FPS, la inversion despues de tener la camara seria en lente que es lo que permitira la buna calidad de video, saludos y suerte...                    One of my best purchases this year. I am very happy with this product, It could have a few more features.                    If you're looking for a mid-level camera, this is a great buy. It might be a little too involved for people brand-new to DSLRs, but if you've had one before, this is a good step up                    You can't go wrong with a Canon product.  They have been making great products for a long time.  We have owned multiple Canon products, and even their point and shoots are top notch.  The T3i is a new version of their inexpensive line of the dSLR type cameras.  Is it going to give you the same results as their >$1000 cameras, no?  But it will deliver excellent photos for the photography hobbyist.  If you are having trouble picking a digital camera though, I found this 10 question quiz that help narrow down the search.  I thought it was pretty helpful.  Happy Shopping![...]                    The product is good but the promotional deal through Amazon's website doesn't work. Canon rebate center does not accept the invoice from the Amazon website and will not issue rebate. Amazon refuses to give an acceptable invoice. still not resolved months after puchase. What a hassel!                    It has the ability to take IMMACULATE pictures both Day and Night.Unfortunately, i bought it to take VIDEO at NIGHT. While it DOES work, it doesnt allow much in the way of ZOOM or APERATURE functions in VIDEO mode.I'm not a professional picture taker... hell, i dont think i've EVER taken a picture in my life, but theis camera is EXCELLENT at turning you into a PRO.It only took me 1 day to learn all of the functions (no thanks to the instruction manual... i used hands-on experience to learn it).While its great at picture taking, i wouldnt say it's worth the $800 BEST BUY Pricetag, let-alone the $706 AMAZON Pricestag (which I paid).$500 would be more in the Ballpark...Unlike my Canon Camcorder, though, this camera does have a WIDE-ANGLE lens, so you can record people right-up close to you, or even super-close-ups, of, say... INSECTS, or what-have-you.But the Lens isnt too good at Far-Away shots. I reccommend purchasing another lens as well, for that kind of shooting.Still a good Camera, just a little over priced.                    This camera was purchased mainly for its HD Video capabilities. Having multiple lens options that are affordable in a more compact design makes the DSLR video world very appealing. The T3i is a really nice entry level DSLR, but for video use, there are few problems.The "HDMI Out" when router thru the camera is not really 1920x1080, as described. It's more like 1620x. And when you press record on the camera, the HDMI Out drops its signal even more, to Standard Definition. For us, this is a major issue. If your workflow only requires you to record internally to your SD card, and you're totally content having your original footage saved as an h.264 file, this isn't a problem. In addition, a few Canon DSLRs (and maybe others) have a well-known limited record time, approximately 10 minutes before overheating then shutting down. To reduce compression and loss of color, and to increase our record time, we planned to use the HDMI Out and save our footage to an external recorder in a better format. We were unpleasantly surprised to find that this cannot be done. Limitations such as these should be boldly disclosed in Canons documentation. Again, the T3i is a wonderful little DSLR and prefect for what DSLRs in its class were traditionally designed to do; capture great still photography images.                    There is a reason it is #1 sold SLR digital cameras online....It's MAGNIFICENT. I bought it mainly for the video recording, and man, this is a BIG step up over my Samsung F44.                    Great Camera! It uses all of the camera lenses and filters that I had for my old 35mm Canon camera. Awesome!
!###I chose this camera (after reading many reviews) based on it's low light capabilities. It does take very nice quality low light pictures as long as the subject is sitting still. The problem is I bought it to photograph my daughter's gymnastics meets. It is, in my opinion, one of the toughest things to shoot (and I've taken almost 30,000 pictures since I got my first digital camera in 2004)--low light, no ability to use flash, high speed, from a distance and people frequently walking in front of the subject. Unfortunately, this camera could not get the job done. The issue was the autofocus. I tested the sports setting, resetting aperature and shutter speed, and various focus settings. I just could not get a clear picture...and I shot almost 1400 before returning the camera. I opted for the Sony a55 and couldn't be happier! Crystal clear action shots with vivid color on the first try. I used a tamron 2.8, 70-200 lens & a tripod for both cameras so the only thing I can attribute the difference to is the camera itself. So, to sum it up...if you are only taking still pictures, the canon is fine BUT if you are shooting any movement at all, get the Sony.                    People have loved the quality of videos I have produced since buying this camera! If you are not familiar with an SLR take a course like I did. I used Dave Dougdale's course. It really helped me because this is my first SLR and I didn't know what I was doing. lol. I am learning that I am going to need a full frame for the upcoming stuff I wanna do. However, If you are into video like I am you can't beat the quality for the price. Love this camera!                    Bought this as a Anniversary gift for my wife. She has taken over 500 pictures since our purchase and so problems. Thanks Amazon you are Great                    I am very pleased with my order, this camera is amazing and very good for anyone who is in a Photography class for getting good shots, or just anyone who wants to get good shots, really. The quality of the camera is very good. The pictures that I have taken so far have turned out very well, and I like this camera a lot better than my other digital camera from Fujifilm.It is easy to navigate through the menu to change settings, and changing the type of setting you want for taking pictures. The lens I ordered, the 18-55 mm lens is very good for taking pictures as well. This camera is absolutely worth the price.I would definitely recommend it someone who wants a better camera to take nicer shots, or if you are in a Photography class. It's all an around pretty good camera, and I will definitely get future use out of it.                    Canon has always been a great company making DSLR. I am not a professional user, but I always like to take picture of family. The SLR is not too heavy to carry around and it has an amazing shutter speed so I am able to capture every moment of my son. This SLR is definitely great for my lifestyle and as a beginner user. Very satisfied.                    I bought this for a &#34;Family&#34; camera after many complaints about the quality of pictures from smaller &#34;point and shoot&#34; cameras.  So far, the pictures have been excellent and the family is thrilled.                    Very happy with our camera. I am still learning new things about it, and I take a lot of pictures!!  The quality of the pictures are very clear.                    After tons of research, comparing this model against the t4i and sl1, I decided to go with the t3i. Its priced below the t4i and sl1 but still stands up to them in value.  I love the camera!                    There are plenty of incredible and far more in-depth reviews for this camera that you can read online. This one from DPReview will tell you everything you need to know, and far more than you ever wanted to know about this camera.http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos600dMy few thoughts to add to this...I bought this camera because the T2i's price had jumped since it had become discontinued, the T4i was being pushed and promoted, and as a result the prices for the T3i were being slashed in preparation for the T4i. The camera takes great pictures, and it has rich quality, it can handle a surprisingly high ISO levels.The UI is a little bit confusing, for the most part it's fairly intuitive, but tweaking some of the settings in some of the modes like aperature priority or shutterspeed priority, can be a little less then clear.Outdoors, this camera shines, and handles lighting beautifully for the most part, however, sometimes, the camera for some reason greatly emphasizes shadows depending on the angle that you're shooting at. Of course, adjusting the angle of your shot will change the way your camera deals with the light, and the way it records the light, but there are certain, very FEW, situations where the camera for some reason struggles to properly capture the light correctly and as a result the photos come out very underexposed.Sometimes on indoor shooting the camera struggles with white balance, for the most part the auto-white balance is satisfactory, but at certain points it struggles and you might it necessary to go in and tweak WB settings for the camera, it's something you should be aware of as you shoot, so as to avoid slaving over the computer fixing the WB in all of your shots.Sometimes when the camera is on autofocus, it will choose the wrong focus point, changing the camera's focus point is not exactly intuitive, quick or easy which is unfortunate and annoying. It'd be nice if the camera had a more intuitive and quick way to change the focus point for your camera instead of having to recompose your shot everytime :/But again overall, it's great. I havent really shot much video with it so I can't comment on that.... I've been shooting with a 50mm f/1.8 lens for the most part :/                    This is my first DSLR, and I love it. I received it last week and spent the weekend taking great nature and landscape pictures. Easy to use and has good picture quality. Great camera for the price.
!###UPDATE AT END OF REVIEW!!!  FROM 1 STAR TO 4.I have been a hardcore Canon fan for more than a quarter century.  I have owned a couple of pre-Rebel cameras, 5 Rebels - 2 film, 3 digital - 2 video recorders, 2 photo printers, and too many lenses, filters, and accessories to inventory here.  I have been faithful to the brand because I have never had a dud or even a problem though I've treated the items with anything but kid gloves.  With the exception of this camera, all items purchased continue to function perfectly even though I have been extremely tough on many of them.  For example, several of the earlier cameras and lenses have been exposed to desert environments (dust storms, heat exceeding 105 degrees, and no shade for hours at a time), challenging uses (took one or more at a time rock climbing & strapped it/them - camera & lens - to me as I climbed.  Needless to say it/they banged against the rock face several times during these adventures), and dampness, sometimes extreme (coastal environments, beaches, storms, rain, etc.).  In spite of the abuse, and lack of regular care or cleaning, they all continued to perform wonderfully.  Then came along the T3i.  Knowing I was planning another trip to Costa Rica in February 2012, I decided to again upgrade my digital Rebel collection in December 2011.  I received the new camera promptly & was excited by it's look and feel, a wonderful improvement over some earlier versions.  Still easy to use and mostly intuitive, and best of all, loved the pictures I got - super clear and sharp!  I thought this was my best purchase yet!So, what's my problem?  Since I made this purchase I used this camera (lightly and gently) on my Costa Rica trip, a 3 day trip to Moab, Utah, and for a portion of a child's Easter egg hunt on Easter Sunday 2013.  Why only for a portion?  Because half way through the egg hunt the camera would no longer auto focus.*  I have done everything I can think of to get it to work.  I have charged, then changed the batteries, tried different lens that work with other Rebels, made sure the lens I was using worked on the others cameras, cleaned the contacts and camera thoroughly.  Nothing.  I can't sense to get a decent shot out of this camera anymore.  So, I decide to take it to a camera shop to see if I can get it repaired, and they tell me the cost is 175 dollars just to look at it, and it will likely cost several hundred to fix.  So it seems my 600 dollar, nearly new/almost unused camera will cost me as much or more than I paid for it to fix it after two and a half light uses?  Suddenly not such a fan of Canon or their Rebel line.By the way - the camera and lenses were all properly stored in dry, cool space with plenty of padding and dust protection along with my older equipment which continues to function flawlessly in spite of how rough I was with them (the older items) when I was younger and more daring.*I often use auto focus these days because as I get older the camera "sees" much more clearly than I do, especially when my "targets" are moving, such as children "hunting" eggs.UPDATE:Ok, I feel really dumb now.  Being determined not to spend as much as I paid for the camera to have it fixed, I have been holding out, using other cameras, and playing with my T3i periodically to see if there was an easy fix.  For whatever reason, it only occurred to be this morning to check the dioptric adjustment knob and some of the buttons on the back of the camera for unintended adjustments.  Sure enough that was the problem.  After checking the dioptric adjustment, which moves very freely on my camera, and some of the buttons on the back (still not sure quite what I did here) my camera is back as good as ever.  I must have touched these adjustments while putting the camera in my case or taking it out.  I've never had this happen with any of my other cameras.  Caused a fair amount of frustration, but in the end I probably have to own some of the problem.  With that said, I also don't think it should be so easy to completely mess up settings on a camera, so I'm keeping one star for what I consider a design or manufacturing flaw (not sure which).                    This was a Christmas gift for my youngest daughter.  She's very happy with it, so that's all that's important.  I thought it was rather pricey.                    we bought it one month ago.it is easy to assemble and easy to use.The picture quality is very good.patriot mode is not much impressive.                    my wife loves it and it takes amazing pictures and it is easy to use. I would highly recommend it                    Highly recommend this camera. Just good for a beginner. I gave a 4 star because the kit lens it comes with 18-55mm is just ok,                    This is the most popular camera for its price, but in terms of video it is not up to par.When I am shooting, and I go over my 32gb memory, half of the clips get deleted automatically.  (Respond if you know the fix ;)There is no autofocus, but that is not very good on the t4i anyways.The audio is horrible, even now that it has manual gain, so I had to get a Juicedlink preamp to go with it.                    I have been saving for some time for an EOS camera.  When it came right down to it, I was undecided between the Nikon and the Canon.  This is a great little camera for a reasonable price.  I love it!                    This camera gave us great pictures and was easy to use. To use all the effects you'll have to get another lens though                    The price was great!!! Way cheaper than anywhere else. It came packaged up like new! I recommend you buy your product from here. Awesome all the way.                    I have always liked Canon. This camera is fantastic. I would write too much on here so instead of writing a book on how wonderful it is, check out this music video:[...]
!###Shot film in an SLR long ago (Canon A-1), & had opted for portability lately (Canon SX110-IS). This is my 1st DSLR.Read several reviews & chose this over the comparable Nikons with slightly better sensor technical specs, mostly for the swivel viewfinder.  I had one on a Canon G-3, & really missed it.  Lots of shots my favorite become possible only when I can brace the camera high against a fixed object, or cradle it low in both hands, and frame the shot in the swivel viewfinder instead of aligning subject, camera & eye.Happy with the choice for many reasons.  The range of application, shooting RAW with this 18-135mm lens, is enormous.  Camera+lens is very lightweight, easy to handhold, & the lens is remarkably compact for its range.  I use it as a macro lens (.38 image size, I think, but don't rely on my memory), for some landscapes & portraits, & lots of tight telephoto shots.  It's a great "walkabout" lens--shot whatever happen to see, wherever you are.  I shoot mostly aperture priority stills, stopped down to 9 or 11 for sharpness, mostly ISO 100 to minimize noise, but sometimes 400 or higher to get short exposure times.  I've gotten some nice shots of birds in flight or running grand kids, using the "sport" mode, which auto focuses while I track the subject, & keeps shooting as long as the button is pressed.  Reviewers claimed that the controls are more accessible on the Canon, and I have found it easy to set useful defaults and make shot-to-shot adjustments in the most important controls.I had been dissatisfied with the lens speed & dynamic range on my point-&-shoot, and was worried that this lens is not very fast & the sensor does not have quite the dynamic range of the competing Nikon.  However, I discovered that my real problem was that JPEG gives you only one exposure for the whole frame unless you shoot multiple-exposure HDR.  Shooting RAW, I can back down the highlights & boost the shadows when the intensity is uneven, and that actually solves my problem.  Also gives me a more natural look that I prefer to most of the HDR I've seen.  The sensor has greater dynamic range than the final JPEG, so even more would provide diminishing returns.  Even with a cropped sensor, I'm not having much problem with lens speed, even for macro shots & indoor light. Graininess at very high ISO can be filtered, but sometimes it's a nice effect.I did eventually get the Canon 100-400mm EF L lens for even longer telephoto shots, & probably will eventually get a high-end wide &/or macro lens as well.  They say you should spend most of your available money on lenses rather than bodies, so it may be quite a while before I upgrade the T3i.I went through a photo drought for over a year, but since I got this kit I'm shooting a lot.  1000-2000 exposures a week on a couple of recent vacation trips, steady use in between, many diverse projects, posting new work on Flickr daily.  Great fun.                    I bought this camera for my wife and it has renewed her interest in photography. I was a bit more than I wanted to spend but now that I\'m seeing the quality of pictures it produces I think it is worth the money.                    I love my refurbished Canon T3i camera and purchased it 7 months ago directly from the Canon website to take photos of my family.However, a month ago the camera started to have a horizontal black line show up in all images shot with the camera. I sent the camera back to Canon under warranty to have them repair the issue.I got an email back from Canon a week later stating it was not covered under warranty because my camera showed signs of "customer tampering" and that internal screws had been stripped and replaced. This made me furious as I have NEVER opened up my camera or would not even know how to. I have NEVER dropped it and have babied it the whole time.I called Canon customer service and after arguing with them for 30mins they finally agreed to repair the camera for free(I appreciated this). However they still were in denial that they had sent me a defective camera initially which is disappointing and frustrating.I believe there are two possible explanations:1. Canon has significant quality control issues in their refurbished products and they could not detect the tampered screws.2. Canon's warranty center has logistics issues and confused my camera with another warranty camera that had tampered screws.Either way the result is an honest customer not having their warranty honored and falsely accused of "tampering".Bottom Line: GOOD CAMERA BUT DON'T BANK ON THE QUALITY CONTROL OR WARRANTY!                    After much search and comparison, I decided to buy this camera primarily to take pictures of my daughter and an upcoming baby.  I can't believe I waited so long to buy an SLR!!!!  My pictures look professional and I have no idea what I'm doing (still learning!).  Very happy with the purchase.                    I am a "new" photography enthusiast. I have had the T3i/600D for about 4 months now.I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Note that this is not the latest model. There is very little difference between this model and other later or more expensive "crop frame" (APS-C sensor) SLRs from Canon or other makers. Don't get caught up in the spec wars. Concentrate on the basics and in improving your skills, not on the latest gadgetry or features. Picture quality is excellent, once you know what you are doing and practice. Even the 18-55 mm kit IS II lens is decent, especially if you work with it in its sweet spot-- medium to wide angle, and f-stops in the 8-11 range. Make sure you get the latest model (II) of this lens. I also recommend getting the inexpensive but very good value Canon 50 mm 1.8 lens as well.The build quality is excellent, and the camera is intuitive to operate. Controls are convenient. The built-in TTL flash is good for quick convenient snapshots (GN=13), but if you do serious low light photography you'll want an external flash that you can bounce. Get one of the off-brand, manual flashes (such as Yongnuo), and you'll enhance your photography as well as save a lot of money compared to an original Canon flash.  I also highly recommend installing the free, open source "Magic Lantern" software to enhance the camera's capabilities. Particularly useful in this software is the "intervalometer" (timer) feature, HDR bracketing, and the ability to control the bit rate of the video recording.You typically get about 400-450 shots on a battery charge. The camera comes with a CD containing good software for processing RAW files, editing jpgs, transferring files and controlling the camera via the computer. The included printed manual is thorough and well written, and covers a lot of photography basics in a very readable way.This camera is an excellent value and I highly recommend it to people wishing to step up from a point and shoot camera to something more serious. This camera can produce professional looking photographs.I would also recommend buying a moderately priced tripod (the very cheap ones will break after a few uses so don't get tempted, especially with your $600+ camera perched on it). A tripod significantly enhances your options in various situations (low light or landscape)  and will improve your photographs immeasurably.The only serious limitation this camera has is the relatively slow continuous shooting rate. It is rates at 3+/sec, but in reality it is less if your are shooting in low light or in RAW mode. This could be a problem if you like to shoot sporting events or other action shots.                    Researched for many weeks before deciding on this camera and it is just as I thought it would be. Great pictures, easy to start using right away.                    This camera is a lot better than you think.The images from video and photo CAN be outstanding and even compare to the nicer end camers in the $3,000 range.Just make sure you learn the camera and have a few lenses. The kit lens is great too don't listen to the other people that tell you its bad.Check out my videos with the T3i                    Camera in great condition other than a loose shutter release and a battery slot that often doesn't tell the camera that it is closed, which, therefore, does not always turn on.                    I've had this for about a month now, and it is fantastic. PLENTY of customizible settings to get that perfect picture. Definitely a GREAT entry-mid level DSLR, and pletny of lenses available as accessories. Still retains popular auto settings, sport, portrait, etc. Great battery life. Too cool!                    I've been looking at this camera for months now and I eventually bought it. Being a newbie to DSLR cameras, it has an easy learning curve. Quality of pictures with the 18-55mm lens and 50mm lens are great!.. Video quality is excellent with my 50 mm lens on it.
!###This camera fits the bill for a tweener photographer like myself...not a beginner but not an expert.  Very good functionality and ease of operation.  Great for kids sports shots, vacations and general pics.  Not heavy in weight so carrying this around is not a chore.                    Before buying the t3i, consider the t2i.  Research the reviews/differences.  They are small but quite significant to some people. If a t2i can be found for considerably less than the t3i ( $150 or more)  I would seriously consider it.The t3i is quite capable video wise, however it has no autofocus in video mode.  This is hit or miss for some people who don't like the autofocus constantly adjusting during recording yet it is difficult to zoom and focus at the same time.The t3i is absolutely a beginner higher level camera (I'm a beginner).  So its relatively easy to learn on yet takes awesome high quality HD photo and video.You'll need a high class SD card (I bought a 32 GB Transcend and am so far quite happy with it).Overall I am quite happy with the camera and certainly not trying to turn any one off about buying it, only inform others of things I came to learn AFTER buying mine.You should definitely research the t2i as well as the Nikon competitor of this camera before settling on this model.                    It is super light, like really really light, but it produce fantastic and professional images if you play it right.I love it, worth the money!                    This camera is very good buty it does take a little time to get retrained.  After being used to point and shoot cameras this one opens up another world.  Thus far I have been satisfied with the photos and every day I am learning a little more how to get the most out of the equipment                    Unbelievable features in here to support the needs of the more experienced photographers while still having the features to bring up a beginner (like my middle school daughter). Video features area great. Kit lens is good. Really enjoying this camera.                    They applied cripple-by-annoyance to motivate upsales.What I mean by that is they intentionally decided to look for ways to make people want their more expensive cameras, since the sensor technology has gotten so good that this is just as good as the 7D optically (there are some metering differences etc. but really...those aren't hard to overcome). And one way they found to do just that is by making the camera make far more noise than it needs to when doing continuous shooting.There is a mirror lockup feature, and there is a live view mode which locks up the mirror, and there is a continuous shooting mode which better photographers will use especially in this day of essentially unlimited exposure memory. The mirror lockup is intended to minimize vibration by keeping the mirror in place when the shutter releases, but it will also keep things quiet during continuous shooting, where you are machine-gunning off tons of shots in rapid sequence.Sadly, this otherwise nearly perfect camera decides to flip the mirror up and down every single shot of a continuous sequence, and despite all those settings available, none of them are allowed to work. That makes this product embarrassing to use in a quiet space! What company wants to embarrass people for using their product?!?This is why people have created 3rd party firmware for these cameras called Magic Lantern. It's buggy and I don't know if it fixes this particular cripple but they might put it in if people ask. I have not loaded it into my camera but this sort of thing really tempts me.Otherwise this camera is totally awesome for the money. I would also like to be able to zoom in on the image preview (the view of your image that comes up right after you take the picture) which oddly was available on some of Canon's point-and-shoots from years ago. That would let me see quickly if I got sharpness. For video, I would like to be able to completely clear the screen of distractions...there is a white rectangle showing where zooming will happen that I can't seem to get rid of. I would also like to have the histogram available while I'm filming video, and an edge finder feature for focus (see some high-end Marshall LCD monitors).The Digital Zoom 3x-10x is bolted on, requiring a vulcan neck pinch to get going...I sense they weren't sure of this feature, there were bitter arguments about it, not least of which because it's explosive to their product line. Not only is it their only DSLR that offers it right now, I have done the tests and discovered that the 3x digital zoom avoids Canon's achilles heel of DSLR video: It no longer does line skipping when at 3x! This means that the aliasing and moire that dogs all Canon DSLR video at this time (they need to implement a simple anti-aliaser for video capture...c'mon guys) is solved on the T3I/600D as long as you are zoomed 3x. The reason is obvious, it's just using the center pixel sensors rather than the entire 18MP sensor...so it's only working with ~2MP natively and doesn't have to drop anything. This image is great, but when you multiply 3x time 1.6x crop sensor you need a very wide angle lens to work this way without line skipping.I am sure they are withholding anti-aliasing for two reasons: 1) they want to make it exclusive to their high-end cameras first, and those have a longer product cycle, and 2) there must be bitter acrimony within the company about the DSLR division eating the video division's lunch. Nikon et al. will eat Canon's lunch if Canon doesn't eat its own as lunch...that's why we have this great camera, and that's why Canon is going to have to serve us all with uncrippled products soon enough. Just bite the bullet and let the high end products sell themselves on their own intrinsic merit Canon!                    A long time ago I used Canon's AE1's (35mm) for semi-pro photography. A while back I decided I missed taking pictures. Sure my phone as an 8mp camera but it really isn't a camera. Point and shoots are great for snapshots but you can't take real photos with them. I took a chance with the T3i after reading reviews and doing some research. I wanted to stick with Canon as they always treated my right in the past. I was blown away from the FIRST picture (of the parking lot at Best Buy). If you are on the fence buy this camera now. It went well beyond my expectations. Big pros for me are: It's lightweight, it's fast and the auto focus is almost perfect everytime. The cons are: none. Buy a large SD card you will need it...                    We purchased the Canon Rebel T3i last July, and also a Canon SX50is last year. I take a lot of photos for work, and needed both a DSLR and a super zoom. I've been using Canon cameras for years, but we'll be switching to Nikon now.The auto focus stopped working on the Canon Rebel T3i in August, about 13 months after purchase. My eyesight isn't good enough anymore to create sharp focus manually. That is the major issue, minor issues include rubber coming unglued from the camera and limited time being able to record. And my Canon SX50is had the lens hood fall off (among other things), though fortunately it still works.I'm done with Canon after many years of being a loyal customer.                    Its a sad day that I have to write this. In the past six months I have owned two of these a 600d and a t31. The t3i broke after barely 3 months of use, one day if just stopped powering on. Note my 600d stopped powering on as well after barely 10 weeks.  First the power button stopped working and now it's lifeless just like the other.  I purchased the original plus $1500 of lenses to travel the world so I have been using it a lot but if a high dollar camera borks out just from everyday use its not a product worth owning.  I work in IT support so I do now how to take care of electronics and I own perfectly functional electronics from when I was a kid in the 80s. The only electronic equipment that had borked out on my in the past has been manufacture defects not abuse.  I treat all my electronic equipment like girlfriend and pets.  The girlfriends might be a little plumper than when I first met them but all my pets died of old age.  Plus the canon warranty and support is totally worthless if you're traveling.  Its really sad to write this because I was a staunch canon person and recommended their products to numerous people.... Wish I got some love back..                    I got this camera after reading reviews here on amazon and also doing my research on dpreview.Was torn between the Nikon 5100 and the Canon T3i.Certainly a learning curve, if you havent used a canon before. All the users controls are not intuitive. Certainly needed the user guide and a book to familiarize with the usability.Picture quality with the 18-55 mm lens are not bad. White balance is a little off.I would say overall I like it
!###I bought the Canon 600D (T3i) for film making so I rarely ever use it to take picture. The T3i is a great HDSLR camera for beginers. The plus side of this camera is that you can install the &#34;Magic Lantern&#34; custom firmware to get more functionality out of the camera (follow focus, timelapse, HDR recording, rack focus, etc...).The only downside of this camera is no 60fps recording at 1080p but if you need that then you could buy the newer version T4i or the T5i.                    Just got my camera the other day and have Used it multiple times now!  The image quality is great.  It is a light camera that is easy to take anywhere.  Right out of the box, it was easy to figure out the settings of th camera and get started quickly.                    After having my Sony camera stolen, I searched a long time for something that was similar to it.  I went with this camera even though the reviews were pretty mixed.  I love it!!! I use it to take pictures of my kids and husband, both of which are action shots.  I use it at family functions, in low light, outside...just everywhere.  And it never fails me.  Don't know how this would work for a professional photographer...but for a mother, wife and memory catcher, it works perfectly!!!                    **Please note that this review was written by a novice photographer.I have been asking my husband for a camera for years. You know how it is....the entire time he is taking pictures with his Nikon D80 (he fancies himself a fantastic photographer...and he is), I am constantly in his ear telling how what I see and envision would make a better picture. I also tell him how he should take a picture of something that I believe will make him the next Ansel Adams. And I complete the photo shoot with,  "if only I had really good camera, I would"..... Well,  I guess he was tired of hearing it, and decided to buy me this camera (for Christmas thru Amazon) if for no other reason than to shut me up. I guess it was his way of putting "his" money where "my" mouth is, and I was delighted.Now what is there to like about this camera.-This camera is user friendly and great for a beginner photographer or at least one that is ready to move from a camera like a Nikon CoolPix. It is perfect for still shots and video (HD). It is easy to select a setting (portrait, action, etc), point and shoot. It focuses automatically (press halfway) and can be manually adjusted (tight or far away photos). There is a menu that allows you to edit and even make images, black and white. **Please note that this is the one feature that no matter how much I read the manual, I can't quite get it to do what I would like. I can edit a picture, change it to black & white, and even use the zoom tool, but when I attempt to save it, it won't.  That is a feature that I will have to continue to fool with. And if anyone can help me, I would appreciate it.-You can manipulate the viewing screen...it flips out and turns (for use while recording video) so that you can view it. Or you can swivel, flip and turn the screen around and collapse it against the body of the camera.  This allows you to see or view the pictures you are taking or have taken.- This camera takes crisp/clear photos. They are amazingly clear.-This camera has a continuously shoot feature/function. It is great for my son's wrestling matches.-This camera has an automatic flash that is useful if you aren't sure about the lighting.-This camera is light (weight wise) enough to carry around for a long period of time (your hand won't get tired), but it also comes with a comfortable and adjustable neck strap. There are also cords that come with the camera so that you can use with the computer or TV.-The battery life is decent. I assume that it also depends on how many videos you do versus still shots. However, I have done both and found and didn't have a problem.  This camera also comes with a convenient battery charger.Overall, I love my new Canon Rebel T3i and look forward to (a) learning everything about it that I can and (2) taking tons of fantastic pictures for years to come.                    This camera is everything I hoped for in a beginning professional camera. If you're looking to the basics of photography from aperture, shutter speed, and ISO to lighting and color quality, this is a great beginning camera.                    I have a T2i, got this for my fianc&eacute;. Really like the flip out LCD display. Might have some incompatibility with one of the lenses, but, not so sure that's the camera body's fault versus the lens.                    I got this for filmmaking because of course I don't have 3000 for a red camera. I did ton of research on dslr cameras and this one won me over. Eye pleasing 24 frames per second at 1080p. What more to ask for. The audio is not good but noisy of course cause its built in and good for syncing up with another audio like a shotgun mic with the program plural eyes.  I love this camera. My first dslr and my last stand attempt into filmmaking.                    Its a great camera, its inexpensive, but really its what you do with the camera that sets it apart for others. Its fast, light weight, and accurate. I love my mine. I would never go Nikon. I have a 7D, and I have use of a 5D, but they are heavy. If you are shooting a wedding or on a long hike looking for wild life, its an important consideration, 5d gets heavy.And Amazon rules in shipping and their a-z guarantee are unsurpassed!                    This camera is fantastic. The lens completes the camera. The picture and video quality is amazing. The sharpness in the ISO is also amazing. I have taken picture with ISO 1,600 and the picture looks phenomenal. Canon's JPEG processing is at its best. The only bad part of this camera is the continuous shooting; this is bad especially if you are taking pictures of sports. I have also notice that it tends to overexpose pictures in bright sunlight. Of course this can be fixed by using manual settingsProsVideo and picture quality - 18 Megapixels!HDMI outputGreat and fast autofocusConsSlow frame rate - (sports)Live view AF is laggy                    I am a ardent amatuer photographer since the age of 12 or 13 when My first real camera was a twin lens reflex Yashica and then progressed into 35MM with my father's pre-war Leica shooting miles of black and white film. As an adult I migrated into Canon SLRs and even two top of the line Nikons SLR's. Digital photography was becoming mainstream and I purchased a Panasonic and Canon pocket cameras.The images from the Canon were very reminecent of good ol' Kodachrome 25 meaning intensity and warmth color, crispness etc. So when I decided to get back into SLR land it was a choice between the T3i and the simialar Nikon.  After spending time researching the net for comparisons I chose the Canon based primarily based on image comparisons not necessarily features.  After a month with the T3i I can say that you have to read the book and experiment.  The first pictures out of the gate were nice but where was the punch? ...after reading a few chapters the depth of programs and customization of same, led me back to my Kodachrome 25 images.I continue to play with it and burning electrons in my search as I continue to learn how to get more and different effects.In a nutshell, this is one fine camera and would recommend it to anyone. There are the Nikon and Canon die-hards out there that will continue to say their brand is better than the other, but my defining characteristic is that good old K25 look and feel of my photos.From a technical standpoint the menus are well laid out and easy to understand drill downs enhanced by short menu descriptions that even a photo-tyro can understand.  Five stars Canon!
!###I'm enamored with this little guy.  I picked one up after doing a volunteer PA gig on a film crew this summer.  For a student, or anyone on a budget, the quality on this thing is magnificent.  I've put mine through some pretty sketchy situations (like duck taping it to the foot rest of a motor scooter, driving at speed) and it's held up well.  The on-board microphone is garbage, though, you can line in external recorder through the 1/8'' input.  The interface is deep enough to gain an understanding of the camera while retaining beginner's level simplicity. I've heard a lot of people complain about the kit lens, but you can compensate for it with a little meticulosity and composition skill.  You don't need thousands of dollars in glass to take reasonably good shots.                    The camera is phenomenal. Rather than buy the somewhat 'bad' kit lens with it, I purchased a used older lens separately, a 28-105 Canon Ultrasonic EF lens. The pictures are very sharp, and using a 16GB class 10 SDHC card, it is more than fast enough for my needs. The camera is capable of correcting for any dust on the lens, but I haven't tried this yet. Overall, the only downside I've seen is my mental association of the Eos Rebel branding with Andr&eacute; Agassi, which is hardly fair to the camera. I'm trying to think of it as a Canon 600D, but not having much luck.                    Hi,  This would be a good camera for starters in photography. Easy to handle and it gives u a lot of options. The product was good and the packaging was excellent. Thanks to Amazon!!                    Wow, what a difference just a few years make!  I am your typical mom that loves to keep a camera pointed in my kids direction at all times.  I owned a Canon PowerShot camera for years and was satisified with the pictures that I took, but knew that they could be better, sharper...Well several accidental drops of said camera later, and I am the proud new owner of my very first DSLR.  Let me just say, I am in LOVE with this camera.  I know that there are bigger, better (more expensive!) choices out there, but for me, the T2i was the perfect fit.  I researched cameras for well over a month, reading review after review, blog after blog, and ultimately they all pointed in the same direction.  Anything more powerful (or with more buttons to figure out) was going to be a waste of money on my part.  The T2i will do more than I probably will EVER need and the price point was just right.  When my p&s camera first bit it, I had seen the all new Canon EOS 60D & immediatley decided that I HAD TO HAVE IT.  I am so glad that I fought off the urge to purchase it before doing some research.  The T2i is a great beginner-intermediate camera for someone who have never owned a DSLR.  I could'nt be more thrilled with my purchase...my kids however, they really enjoyed that month of research time when MOM was cameraless!                    This is my first DSLR and just love this camera(still learning how to use it).I ended chosing canon over nikon because I prefer canon on screen menu, it's quicker to acces all the parameters I want to change.the feel is nice I like the grip texture, weight is about right.I'm glad I got this model insted of the T2i because it's nice to have the swivel screen and even I don't have it yet I can allready see that I could benefit from a wireless flash.Note: you must get a tripod(still don't have one but I desperatly need one) or at least a low light lense like the 50mm f1.8(have one) to be able to take pictures at night(or in dark places) wiouth using the flash and with a low ISO setting.                    This was an upgrade for my wife from her Rebel XTi, which she's used for over 30,000 photos in about 3 years.  it's slightly bigger than the XTi and the size of the rear screen means buttons have been moved around so it took a little getting used to, but the image quality is very good.the new LCD on the back is great and the resolution helps you determine whether your shot is focused.  the focusing is great when shooting stills, but it's painfully slow when doing video so you'd be better off with a canon lens that does Full Time Manual focus.one downside is the disappearance of the sensor that used to sit below the viewfinder and turned the screen off when the camera was put to your eye.  now you have to turn it off with a half-press of the shutter.  i do not like this change.                    its is great quality. images look almost real. im still struggling taking pix with it at night, because its too smart to catch any pic but im working on it                    This is a great "entry level" DSLR for those DSLR newbies or amateurs.GOOD: high definition CMOS; high ISO (100-6400);good picture quality; crystal sharp lcd screen for picture review and the lcd screen also is turn-able for framing whenever you need it; support full HD video; very easy to operate.Bad: no complain so far. Of course you shouldn't compare it with those higher level Canon's DSLR such as 60D, 7D, 5D Mark II...Conclusion: Good value for its price.                    I absolutely love my T3i, especially with the new swivel lcd.  I saved quite a bit of money buying it off Amazon.  Having it come with the kit lens is also very nice.  The lens itself is just a 18-55 mm and it's not the ideal lense to use in low-lighting, but it still takes great photos and the footage is still beautiful.                    This Camera is amazing and takes wonderful pictures. The best that I have owned so far. Cannot see any drawbacks. Perfect for an Entry Level DSLR as well as one with intermediate level.
!###I recently decided to upgrade to a DSLR camerea.  The canon t3i was the perfect choice for me, not low end, not high end, but everything I needed.  I shoot a lot of animations and needed a remote triggering system.  The shot quality is amazing.  Easy to use.  Canon has a simple and very effective tutorial that helps out with understanding all the bells and whistles of this camera.  Highly recommend.                    I have been wanted to get into the DSLR market for a while and planned on doing it in the future however I saw some YouTube videos taken with a DSLR and was amazed. I was motivated enough that I bought this camera and since then (3 months or so) I have not regretted it. I love the photos I am able to take and I love the video quality as well. In fact, here is a link to the video I made on YouTube, check it out to see what an novice can do with this camera... [...]All the shots in the video are with the kit lens except the very first moon shot, I borrowed a friend's 75-300mm lens.The kit lens has been great. Sure I would love to buy a nice L-series Canon lens, but can't afford it at this time. I took some portraits over the weekend and loved the results! Here is something to try, put the focus at about 50mm, set aperture as low as possible, make sure your shutter speed is at least 1/60 for handheld (maybe be in the aperture mode so that is automatic), increase your ISO if it is darker, and take some head shots of someone. Put them up against a cool background (a brick or stone wall...) and take a few shots. Really, I have been impressed with the great photos I have been able to take.To take it to the next level also check out Photoshop Lightroom. It is an amazing program and can really help your photos stand out.Anyway, if you haven't been convinced yet from all the other reviews, this is a great camera, I have loved it, have not regretted spending the money for it, and it has brought a lot of fun to my life. I hope you decide to buy a DSLR, if not today do it soon!                    This is my first DSLR camera and I totally love it. The images are amazing. Still mastering some of the manual functionality but overall very happy with this purchase                    This is my first DSLR, and I absolutely love it. As a complete beginner, I love that is has easy presets yet makes the more advance features easy to navigate. The quality of the images is excellent.                    This is my first DSLR and it is an amazing camera.  The ease of use is the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about the pros of this camera.  It is very user friendly and has the pre-set settings to take pictures for all occasion.  The picture and video quality is also amazing.  I love taking video of our new born and then watching it in HD.  The swivel screen is another great option that the T2i(Older model) does not have.  Having this has been very useful for akward angle pictures during functions.  The battery life of the camera has been good I don't use the camera daily but it still maintains a good amount of charge if i got a week between use for a few weeks.  Cons for the camera are very minimal but one thing is even though the pre-set settings are very user friendly the manual settings are not so user friendly but once you get the hang of what the settings need to be for a specific shot then its not a huge deal.  Overall def recommend the camera to anyone looking for an entry DSLR and would tell them to upgrade to the 18-135 lens instead of the 18-55.                    NOT bad...My first dslr and have owned it for about 6 months now. the good....long battery life, pictures look great but don't do what i did ,buy a bunch of used cheap canon or tamron lenses from eBay.invest in a good lens. the saying is true your camera is only as good as your lens I will go as far to say that the t3i takes as good if not better the my 5d mark 2.yeah i said it.the video component is awesome, many options to choose from add MJ and add even more options ,a good camera stabilizer is a must when shooting video unless you like the shaky camera look.the things I don't like ...the camera feels cheap in hand its light and small..you may like this I don't .if you want something with some more heft go with the 60dif i had a do over that's the camera i would go with.....that's it .                    We had a Canon G series camera earlier which got damaged due to salt water. So went for the T3i this time. Its a very good camera with lot of features. My wife is still learning to try out all the features as it is very vast. Lot of unique capabilities which I have not seen in any other cameras.                    So I'm a film student and I decided to upgrade from my Panasonic DVX100A camcorder to something that can do HD. T3i is a really good camera for the price and for what it is. For film this camera is awesome, it has option for an external mic and I would recommend this model over the T2i because of the swivel screen but also for the manual audio controls. The T3i is definitely modeled more for film than the T2i. I heard T2i does well if you get magic Lantern but I didn't want to have to hack my camera software to get the benefits of audio controls that the T3i already has built in. The T3i gives plenty of options for filming it has 1080p 24p, or 720p 60p, and some others that I wasn't interested in. I just care about the film look and some higher frame per seconds to do some super nice slow motion. The benefits of filming with the T3i is that you can interchange the lens and really add more to your cinematography. The only downside to the camera when it comes to filming is that there is about a 12-15 min cap on how long you can film one continuous clip in Full HD, if the clip exceeds 4 gb in size the camera will automatically stop recording, although recording back to back is not a problem, just an inconvenience that make camcorders still the leading cameras for broadcasting. This camera is not ideal for filming events but good for making narratives. The quality is amazing and has convenient controls to change shutter speeds and aperture and ISO. For filming this camera is superior to its Nikon competitor Nikon D3100. For Photography this camera does pretty well, its 18 mp picks up clear and crisp pictures it has a ISO range from 100-6400, but beware that ISO 3200-6400 the pictures have considerable noise. It shoots 3.7 pictures per sec and has a max shutter of 1/1000 not bad a little less than the 60D and 7D but it shares the same sensor as them, it is a great camera if you're learning photography or wanting to get into video. Easy to use has a good interface and comfortable grip. and sturdy build.                    Works great and I paid only $694 including tax. Extensively tested this camera and all is well. Tilt/flip LCD Screen is very handy and this allows you to even take pictures of yourself. The upper priced DSLR Canon models lack this feature. This is all the camera your amateur photographer will ever need. It feels light and is well balanced in your hands. If you want better quality pictures than the provided kit lens gives you, go buy yourself a Canon L lens for this T3i body. Buying a better body is not the answer to better pictures. It is like stereo equipment, the quality of the Stereo PreAmp/Amp  can only audibly improve the sound just so much. Having overkill amp power and statistical levels of inaudible  distortion, that the ear cannot hear in the first place, does not improve sound quality. The "SPEAKERS" are the only part of the system that can do that. So here too, it is the "LENS" that really makes the difference in "PICTURE QUALITY" and not the camera bodies that have overkill features not necessary for 99.99% of camera users. Don't waste your money on those bells and whistles, buy yourself a better lens instead.The T3i is a great camera body and the 55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS kit lens is not bad either for the money.                    Coming from an old rebel XTi, the T3i walks wonders around its older counterparts.  The body feels better, tighter, and sturdier.  The buttons and menu can be intimidating at first, but take your time to learn Canon's system because it's worth it!  It takes beautiful photos and the ability to shoot in RAW is all you need to have professional photos without spending > $2K on a camera!  I'd love to upgrade to a 5D or 7D someday but I don't know about that, so for now I'm sticking with the T3i (600D).  Couldn't be happier!
!###The camera is great, after a sporting event 2 other people that was there purchased a camera as the one I have.  Sporting shots are great, 15-20 with one click.                    This camera is just what I was looking for. It works beautifully and takes great pics. Wish I had bought it sooner.                    This is the best camera for the money.  Get the battery grip as an add on.  You will love it.                    Great Camera.  I'm a complete amateur photographer, but this is very easy to use and takes great pictures.  Extremely happy.                    I am new to dslr's but so far I am loving the camera. Works well and its good for beginners. Amazon shipped it fast too.                    This was a great camera for about 4 months. Until today when the reflex mirror bracket broke. I always taken very good care of my Canon T3i. I have never dropped my camera or mishandled it in any way and it breaks while taking pictures. I don't recommend this camera. Buy another DSLR.                    Was in between this and the Nikon d3100 which was around the same price at the time. So absolutely glad that I chose this camera, it's absolutely wonderful.                    Wow...then stunned silence when i first saw the images from this Camera. I am a first time SLR user and this is a major upgrade from my point and shoot. Even as i learn about the more advance features of this camera, the basic options enable me capture the most precious moments without blotching them. 2nd day of usage and i would be sure to update this review once shortly. Amazon thanks for excellent packaging, Canon for a great product you have a buyer for life.                    Fantastic camera, thousands of pictures later this is one of the best purchases I've made.  I couldn't recommend the rebel family of Canon cameras more.  Superb for the price.                    I love this camera so far. I'm new to DSLR, but find it very easy to use. From my understanding the lens is really no good compared to others, but I'm ok with it.  It still takes much better photos than my point and shoot and is an inexpensive way to go to get a feel of the camera and the manual settings before upgrading to something better (which I plan on doing eventually).  Needless to say, I'm a happy customer!
!###Excellent camera, sharp photos, has various modes simple enough to work with even for a novice like myself. Now i don't want to go back to the regular play and shoot cameras. Worth the investment....                    purchased this as a christmas gift for my wife. She's always had smaller compact cameras and complained about the picture qualitiy and time between pictures. The picture quality on this camera is awesome and there is no hesitation between pictures. Most important, she loves it and thats saying a lot because she is a crazy when it comes to taking pictures. I thought the size would be a problem as she is a fast pace girl but she hasnt complained about that once. Im not a camera tech so thats all i can offer                    Canon does it again.I owned the T2i for about a year and used it to take pictures at concerts. It was a great camera. When I saw this camera, I got it thinking that it would be better. This camera exceeded my expectations. I have used both cameras at the same time to see the difference. This camera is SO MUCH BETTER. It adjusts to the lighting around me so much better than the t2i and the moving screen is perfect for taking video, since sometimes to get a great shot you need to put the camera in different positions. The microphone is amazing and HD video is spectacular.It is a great camera for beginners since this camera explains what each mode setting does. This camera was worth every cent and more.                    The Canon Rebel T3i is an amazing DSLR. It's features and specifications produce exceptional picture quality. This is a great product for anyone buying their first DSLR. It surpasses all of it's predecessors and is by far one of, if not, the best entry-level DSLR currently on the market. I have nothing but praise for this camera as it's features and specs are just amazing. Visit Canon's website for more detailed info on this DSLR here: [...]                    We gave to our son and daughter-in-law for Christmas! They were thrilled.  It takes wonderful pictures and my son is having a ball trying all the stuff on it.  Really great!                    I have had my camera for about a month now, I am very pleased with the product. Takes great photos, and amazing video. The lens that came with the camera is actually pretty good, its very wide, and is pretty decent on close ups. I plan on getting another lens for portraits.The only real deal I have with the camera is the grain, and ISO for video, but with the proper video editing software, like Red Giant De-noiser it takes care of the problem.                    Love, love, love this camera! I had been using/ borrowing my father in laws T2i for general use and weddings and I loved it. When we decided to purchase, we went with the T3i and couldn't be happier. The screen rotates around so it can be completely protected when not in use, and if you are taking pics at floor level or above your head, it can be moved to the perfect angle. Can't wait to use this screen for taking family photos with a tripod. It has a great feel, and compared to the T2i, the size/weight is not a problem. I've taken fabulous pictures and I'm very happy with it! I also like the accessories and little gadgets that you can also purchase!                    Awesome package by canon available for beginners to start with. Have you hands settled down with basic controls with higher quality photos and then be creative with plenty of advanced features. Budget SLR to kick your photography passion!!!                    Wow..... I haven't had a canon Rebel since the 35mm days.  Always upgrading my point and shoots every year.  Didn't know what I was missing.  This camera can be as simple as a point and shoot and as difficult as you want it to be.  The shots over Christmas of my family are simply amazing even on the auto+ mode.  I never wanted to drop $1k on a camera so with the price drops the time was right.  Simply amazing photos.                    Wonderful camera! We love it! We are having a great time with this Canon EOS Rebel T3i.  If you want a good camera you could choose this one because it is excellent.
!###I decided to go to a new SLR digital. There are so many great things about this camera I will not attempt to go into them. This is a camera you just have to try for yourself.                    Switching from my 10 year old Nikon D50, to the Canon was a great step up.  Excellent photos, if a little over exposed.  The 18-135mm lens is also a great addition and adds a noticeable improvement in depth of field to the photos.No comment yet on durability.  Like I said I had the Nikon for 10 years and had no issues, so we'll see how the Canon performs.All in all a great buy.                    It is a very easy to use camera and takes wonderful pictures.  However, the lens that came with it has a limited range, and to get something for longer distance, it is expensive!  also, I think it is too much dummy proof - great for novice to intermediate photographer.                    I have a T2i and really needed a flip screen for some odd shots, and well its just like my T2i that I really love so its a great addition to my camera family!                    All good!Camera and EF 85mm f/1.8 lens are awesome..am worried only abt the price.. that came down at another site by abt 90$'s in a weeks time.. maybe because of talks of a T4i!!lower price at Adorama with coupon code S1234567 @ USD 539[...]                    It takes good pictures. No prior experience needed to operate thiscamera. I like all the features that this camera has. I wish they included betterlenses with this camera                    5-star, diamond rating!  I am in love with my baby!  I LOVE it to death!  You must buy this camera!  LOL                    I opted to purchase this camera new on Amazon instead of a direct retailer, and even though the price continued to fluctuate higher and higher, I still was thrilled with the price, quick delivery, and mint condition of this brand new camera.  I love purchasing from Amazon and am dismayed I didn't get turned onto this method of shopping earlier in life.  Thanks Amazon!                    Nice enough Rebel, but the lack of noise has not lived up to the hype... very disappointed... my 1Ds Mk III beats it hands down...                    Liked it very much. Was thinking between NIKON 5100 and this one but after browsing through the reviews, finally got this one. Certainly a good camera for a novice like me with a decent prising
!###In a world of rapidly advancing tech, with much of it dropping in price while offering an increasing array of features, the Canon Rebel T3i offers some of the strongest tools available in a DSLR body at a remarkable price. Quite possibly one of the best values in imaging on the market today. I use it in tandem with the Canon 5DM2.                    This is my first camera of anything remotely high end.  The first few times I have taken it out have made me realize what good photos can look like with the right camera in your hands.  Took it to the dog park earlier this week. Shot about 300 pictures and had a hard time deciding which one I liked the best.  This camera is great, the settings let you have as much control as you want, so as your skill with the camera increases you can start controlling more and more of the individual elements that help make your photos stand out.                    I needed a camera to both take professional quality pictures and record at full HD 1080. I am a published author and am currently writing my next how-to book on balloon twisting. The publisher wants to do ebook versions with video embedded, so I needed to find a reasonably priced way to create both pictures and videos for the ebooks. So far any fault with the video and pictures has more to do with my knowledge (or lack thereof) of good studio lighting and proper lenses for proper settings. The camera itself works great. Both the video and pictures are sharp. I read reviews on the camera and so got an external microphone to plug into the camera rather than using the built in one. Also the veri-angle LCD screen is great for being able to frame myself in the shot before starting to record since I'm usually doing these pictures and videos alone. It is definitely a purchase I would make again (but I shouldn't need to for quite a while).                    I upgraded from the XTi to the T3i.  Great camera!  I could not be more pleased.  I was not sure if the flip out screen was necessary but a recent trip to Disney proved that it was useful.  Holding it above the crowds is now possible.  I upgraded due to my interest in the video capabilities.  I am not 100% thrilled and would not run out to have this to replace a dedicated video camera but it does serve the purpose for the occasional video capture.  It has difficulty focusing but fixed video capture works extremetly well.  If you are reading this to figure out if it is a good camera, I can offer two words..... buy it!                    This camera is fantastic. Construction feels solid, grip feels nice. The kit 18-55 mm lens maybe isn't the best, but you can always buy the body by itself and get a nice prime lens. I'm a student filmmaker, and this camera works great. The swivel screen is great for when I have the camera up on my DIY jib and need to see what I'm looking at. HD video quality is fantastic, even in low light, and it'll only get better with a better lens. I had to film some interviews outside a club in low light, and even at ISO 1600 the noise wasn't distracting, and after a quick denoising pass it wasn't noticeable at all. The camera has an stereo audio input on the side if you don't have an external device to record audio to and, though the camera's weak pre-amp leads to noisier audio, it's definitely still usable. If you're a still photographer and don't need the swivel screen, get the T2i instead. But for filmmakers who want a great camera without have to sell their kidneys, the T3i is freaking sweet.P.S: This camera works with both the CineStyle profile and the Magic Lantern firmware. So. Awesome.                    I primarily use it for video, but I wanted to take pictures as well.I love the dynamic range of light, takes great video in 1080p and 720p.  I wish that you could have more frame rate options in 720p and I also wish that ISOs above 400 were a little less noisy.The kit lens is nice, but I recommend that you get a larger telephoto lens.  The default auto-focus doesn't work to great in the dark, but the quick auto-focus is nice since it shows you green boxes where it's focused.  It's nice that you can zoom in using the LCD screen so that you can ensure your focus is good, but unfortunately, this doesn't work while in video mode.There's not fully-automatic auto-focus in video mode, but usually the cameras that do are too noisy.  You can change the settings so that half-way pressing the shutter button makes it refocus, but it does the slower method and changes the exposure while it focuses.The battery lasts plenty long when doing photos, but video...not so much.  If you plan on doing a video shoot of any length, you'll need to purchase additional batteries.  I'd recommend getting a battery/power grip.  They have a cheap one on here that comes with 4 batteries and has a timer for doing delayed photos and time lapses that I'd recommend.Also, for fun, install the Canon EOS Utility on a laptop.  You can use your laptop to take pictures, do time-lapses, change settings on the camera, and more.Technicolor has a picture profile you can download called CineStyle, which is good for color grading your video in post.  Otherwise, I recommend the Faithful picture style that the camera comes with.Check out LegendaryMedia and 8bitDigitalTV for pictures and videos using the T3i.                    This camera is the simply the best!!!The iAuto feature is also great for persons who do not have experience with the many features of such cameras.I am simply amazed at the picture quality this produces! it is exactly as i am seeing the object or scene it takes an exact duplicate of it, awesome.The speed of this camera is also unparalled, great for taking shots of my oh so active daughter, over all great camera                    This camera is awesome!  I bought it as a christmas gift for my wife and I just received it a little while ago.  Of course I had to open it and make sure it was in working order.  In the few minutes I played with it I was able to take awesome, crystal clear, pictures of random objects around the room.  It is by far the best camera I have ever owned.  Easy to operate, great feel, professional quality pictures within minutes of opening the box.  Literally within 5 minutes of opening the box I was able to take professional quality pictures.  The auto focus works great.  My wife is going to take thousands of pictures of our toddler.  I can't wait to give it to her so I can play with it.  Also, Amazon was great to deal with, as usual.                    Firstly, I'm a Canon guy. I've had 3 Canon point-and-shoots, 2 Canon video cameras (1 HD and 1 not), 2 Canon printers, and I had an EOS 750 SLR back in college so I may be biased. If you're a Canon person, you'll likely not have a lot of trouble understanding the various settings and menus. They have a lot in common with the S90 point-and-shoot I upgraded from.The camera takes great photos of U5 soccer (one of the main reasons I decided to get it now). I haven't taken a lot of HD video with it, but one thing I have noticed is that the autofocus motor noise is audible during the recording. I may try an external microphone if I decide to use the camera for HD video.                    It's a very good camera for its price.  Is very slight. the flip out display is nice and useful. Talking about video, the most of professionals I know, can't distinguish between the results of this camera and more professionals DSLR's like the 7D, 5D, and 60D...  Im really happy.
!###I absolutely love this camera. I upgraded from the t1i and what a great upgrade it was.The size is great, it's relatively light and fits in my hands perfectly.The kit lens (18-55mm) is also better than to be expected. Takes pretty sharp pictures and for the price, can't get any better!The articulated swivel screen is probably my favorite part of this camera. I can close it when not using the camera and not worry about the screen getting scratched, and it really helps for getting those low shots where I normally would had to lay completely flat on my stomach. The screen itself looks beautiful, there are so many pixels so you can get a real good idea if you were in focus or not.Recently, I was considering getting a Canon G12 because I thought I would use it more, but I decided against it. Either way I have to lug a camera around. The G12 may be significantly smaller, but I won't just throw it in my purse without a case, so I might as well have my t3i with me and use my iPhone if I don't have it.Side note: for those looking to get a good CHEAP portrait lens, look at Canon's 50mm Prime f/1.8 lens. It's only about $125 and will allow you to get those great portraits that the kit lens won't.                    We compared the T3i head to head against the Nikon D5100.  In full auto mode, the T3i beats the Nikon.  They are probably identical in the hands of a pro using manual settings, but in auto the D5100 has lousy white balance and notable motion blur.Then we compared the T3i head to head against the D5100, the Sony Alpha 55, and the Canon 60D.  Found the 60D to be too heavy, and that the 18-135mm lens is also too heavy and cumbersome.  I really liked the fixed mirror of the Sony and continuous phase autofocus in live view and movie mode.  But the snapshots of the T3i were slightly better.  With the shortcomings of the a55, it is probably a tier lower and thus overpriced.  I think we'd have bought the a77 over the T3i if both were $700 for the body and 18-55mm kit.The T3i excels under low light, the whole point of moving up from a point and shoot.  It was hard to not go with a mirrorless or fixed mirror system, but the T3i had the best pictures, simple as that.  After taking about 600 pictures in the last few days, had to learn a little about the semi-auto features.  Very useful are setting white balance to scene instead of using auto or a preset, and using portrait mode for indoor shots and putting the flash up or down as desired.  Also find shutter priority mode helpful to get shots without motion blur, and also like locking max auto ISO to 1600 or 800 for lower noise.The bottom line is that we get extremely natural looking photos taken indoors at night without flash.  I took pictures in dim tungsten lighting that look like they were taken in the afternoon with indirect sunlight coming in the windows.  Amazing--why we bought the camera and why it gets 5 stars.Also bought the Tamron 18-200mm zoom lens and the Rode Videomic Pro as accessories--both of those earn 5 stars, too.We purchased the T3i and the Tamron lens online from B&H who has a no-hassle return policy.                    I was not a photo enthusiast like some of the reviewers who were seasoned to the "DSLR" terminologies and technology and I can associate with the few that have come from the "point & shoot" camera experience & the typical knowledge gained through this type of interaction.My choice to move to a DSLR was not an easy one but what I can say is that I had to do some homework like some of the buyers from which I would have been previewed to two names having made their mark in the DSLR photography world being Canon and Nikon. The pros and cons of which I would not go into because the fact remains in the ultimate choice of a person and in the finances they have at their disposal sine both these brands have similar features with "+s and -s" in their own distinctive categories over which they have ruled and still improving on respectively.What I can say from my interaction and use of the camera has improved my photos tremendously and this is mostly in part to the extended and fully capable feature set of this camera. It has been a great introductory DSLR experience for me and this is what I can base my recommendation on and it has only served to improved my thirst for creating better images which has led me to researching materials and training videos to get my skill set up to scratch.I bought the camera with the standard EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS lens and it is a great learning lens for beginners I can definitely see myself progressing to other high-powered lens as I immerse further into the DSLR world and image photography. All with the ultimate goal of transforming what the eyes see on a daily basis into photography, capturing the moment in time and translating it into a story that can be felt by many through their own eyes.I will definitely recommend this camera to those who want to take the bold leap into the DSLR photography world, I can assure you that you will be amazed....                    I received this camera as a Christmas present.  I already have the Canon T1i and have used it and loved it and thought that it would take a lot to beat it but the T3i has.  Using the kit lens from my T1i which is basically the same lens available with the T3i I took fantastic low light shots of my daughter's Christmas tree without a flash.  I used the "P" setting with auto ISO and was very happy with the results.  I used a Tamaron 18-270 MM lens to take some low light shots of my house and the Christmas lights and again was amazed at the results.  Noise levels at even high ISO are very minimal and can be cleaned up with a good editing program.  I have yet to explore all the features of this camera or use the HD video feature but if it is as good as the results I have already seen, it will be amazing.  I am retired and have taken up digital photography as a hobby and while I am no expert or even close, I do consider myself to be an informed amateur and always research any camera before purchase so when I received this from my wife without my input I was a bit surprised but seeing the results very very happy.  The camera can be used by someone new to a DSLR with great results and I am sure that someone who is familiar with all the bells and whistles this camera has will produce amazing results.  I used the T1i while my friend used a Canon 1D and I feel my pictures where as good as his despite that the 1D is a superior camera so I am sure that the T3i will produce even better results.  I would recommend that any person interested in a great DSLR purchase this camera.  I also suggest that while the kit lens does a great job you invest in at least one good zoom lens that will expand your ability to take fantastic pictures.                    We just bought this camera a little over a week ago.  It's our first DSLR camera.  I have barely been able to put it down since I took it out of the box.  When I'm at work, all I can think about it getting home to take more pictures with my camera! It takes amazing photographs, with crystal clear images.  It's easy to navigate for a beginner too.  We did buy a few books so we can read about some of the more in-depth features of the camera, but so far we are very, very pleased.  I promise you won't be dissapointed with this purchase!                    My first SLR..What a good choice for me. It came naturally since I've been using Canon's point and shoot camera's for 35 years. I haven't put it down since I brought if home. Yes, I'm new, and YUP, its fast, accurate and the LCD w/o a doubt is clear, and super fun. My husband was drying our pretty Papillon, I was laying on the bed, taking pics upside down, why, cuz I could! I love how you can take pics at just about every which way your laying, standing, whatever way, its great! Since the SLR is new to me, I have some learning, but so far, it's GREAT. Images are super sharp, clear and despite I don't have a zoom lens, its pretty sweet. We had a nice sunset tonight, and images VERY crisp, and beautiful, along w/ the color.If this is your first SLR, Go for it!!!                    I want this review to help those who appreciate good quality pictures and videos to capture family moments that can be viewed back without saying " I wish the pictures were crisper and more colorful". I am an avid home photographer with no desire to learn any more about my camera than to take pictures in the 'auto' mode that comes with cameras.I've always kept a Canon point and shoot and a Sony video cam (~2005) since my first child was born, and have great photos/videos marking many milestones. I held back from upgrading my DV Video cam to a HD video cam knowing that soon enough (2 years?), I would find a single device to take with me that does pictures and HD video. I started looking into such devices in 2010. I was glad I saw the Sony NEX 5 that had high reviews on dpreview.com. Went with it for Christmas when I had my favorite extended family members and their kids with me for the first time with my new born. It was meant to be a season to remember. Guess what? The pictures were too soft when compared to my previos Canon point and shoot. The HD video was better than my Sony DV camcorder though. But the pictures left me 'wishing'. Kept it for a couple more months while checking dpreview.com if new products that did pictures and HD video were out. Then came across the Olympus PEN EPL2. Sold my Sony Nex 5 for half-price and went for the PEN. Even with the PEN, I was found 'wishing the pictures came out better'. There were no other products that I wanted to try as I slowly was losing hope for one camera that did it all. Then came the Canon T3i.BOY! AM I GLAD I BOUGHT IT! This is a regular DSLR and bulkier than the Sony Nex 5 and Olympus E-PL2 which are Micro Four Thirds. But the pictures and video immediately delighted me. The colors were nicely reproduced. The flash lighting in indoor shots was excellent (a main draw-back with the Sony NEX 5 and Olympus Pen E-PL2). Most family shots are indoors and a good flash is necessary.I can say that I have stopped wishin for good pictures and instead enjoy the beautiful pictures from the Canon T3i with the kit lense. My search for a product that does both stills and video with great quality is complete.                    Great camera that gives the 7d a run for its money. It's not a sealed body like the 7d, but if you care for it as you should anyway, that shouldn't be an issue. The only problem, which for us is HUGE, is that it will drain batteries within a few days when sitting OFF in a camera bag or on the shelf. It seems to use a huge amount of power when off. Called Canon and they said, "yes, they can do that," like, "so? did you have any other stupid questions?" Our 7D and even the 60D never did that. The two Elph 300 camera's we use for quick shots of sets and what not will last MONTHS on a battery just sitting in an un-used state in the camera. This T3i will drain batteries if they are left in a camera body whether or not it's on, so we have to store batteries outside the camera. Which means it's no good for news or run and gun stuff. We're selling it and going to something else since we can't have a camera that drains a brand-new, fully charged Canon battery in three days while sitting on the shelf or that we have to find the battery to install it to take a quick shot.                    First, I love to take pictures and finally got fed up with my digital camera.  The picture quality is excellent! I wish i would have gotten this sooner. I am not camera guru or anything like that. Lack of knowledge when it comes to photography and about cameras.  After I bought the camera some of my friends told me to buy Nikkon. So far I don't regret it.Before I continue I want to say that the next paragraph may be helpful, take for what it is worth from a simple minded person in this area:There is a lot of features to the camera that I am sure that I will never use mostly because i did not see a difference when testing them out.  The movie HD is nice to have and I used it for the first time and I am grateful for it when something happens and need video camera in a matter of seconds. Make sure you read the manual and experiment with the options. Another feature that is pretty cool, you don't have to go through the photo on your memory card one by one when you go through the pictures on the camera, You can break up the photo up to 9 thumbnail so it will save you the time and hassle of pushing the next button.  The battery keeps it charge and doesn't take long to bring it back to a full charge.  The one negative thing for me was auto setting shooting.  I let the camera do all the work and there is a long gap between the auto-focus and when it take the pictures.  I quite often want to take 4-5 pictures in a quick second to get the timing of a little kid who don't want to sit for 15 seconds for three pictures that are the same.Lastly, I read a lot of review the good and bad, and I from a simple point of view: It takes a great high quality pictures, It has all of the bells and whistle (maybe too much for me), but i like to have the options, who knows when they will be handy.  If you are looking for the camera with my mindset, i have to say it is perfect fit for me.  It is a little pricey but looking at some of the pictures i now know that I will get great pictures and not have to worry about all of imperfections of a cheap ($100-$250) camera with a lot of megapixel. Peace in mind knowing that is great to have on your side                    I started my own youtube channel about a year back. At the time all I had was my phone and a Toshiba Camileo H30. For the start-up of my channel it wasn't bad, but doing vlogs indoors left a lot to be desired as far as quality goes and just shooting in low-light in general would be a pain. So after research and talking to a few buddies. They couldn't say enough good things about the Canon T3i, I had to reconfirm their opinion with those of "Professionals" and long and behold almost all the reviews have really positive things to say about this camera.I bought this with a 50mm 1.8 lens and I am super happy that I did, low-light, dark nights (outdoor street lighting), indoors, outdoors it doesn't matter this camera has not let me down. This camera has a ton of buttons and modes for which I recommend reading up on if you decide to move-up from your phone or a point and shoot. After messing with it for about 2 hours I felt confident and I simply love this camera, pictures are nice and sharp, Video (can be shot in 1080p@30fps, 1080p@24, 720p@60p) comes out looking superb, Just be warned ahead of time that all the high-quality photos and videos come at the price of your memory card, especially the video aspect. It will eat up space super quick so I would recommend nothing less than a 16GB (Class 10) memory card to really have a great time with this camera.Also for those who will just buy the body as I did, this camera is classified as a 1.6 crop body, meaning that your lens will actually be a little tighter then what it says. For Example, the 50mm that I purchased really shoots at 80mm (1x50mm=50mm + .6x50mm=30 = 80mm shooting depth), which is pretty tight in spaces between 4 to 8 feet. So keep that in mind when thinking what your needs are, I think I would've been better suited with a 40mm (would shot as 64mm), but that is my fault and it does nothing to hinder the camera's performance when out in the open world.If you want to become semi-serious about your photography and HD Filming, I can't think of a better place to start. This camera has it all plus a pull-out rotatable rear 3.0 inch LCD screen which is just great thing to have for any occasion.Great Camera at a great price that will deliver great performance when capturing those moments in your life you need captured.
!###Good but I had to buy better LenaceThe camera is perfect but I had ot invest more in the lanceI will buy now a good one :-)                    I bought this camera after reading hundreds of reviews of camera's in this price range. I've been an avid Canon point and shoot user and I actually can make better pictures with my old Ixus 75 then with this one. It doesn't do well with bright backgrounds (skies, sun) and colours are somewhat bleak too. I've been fooling around with the settings and am slowly getting more vivid pictures where contrast and brightness in fore and background is more balanced. The fact that you can take out the display makes it very handy for video and photography from odd angles. The AF is very fast, but too slow in Live view. I'm considering to sell and get the T4 or better or even switch to Nikon.                    Graet service from a long distance. I hope for the next discounts of this product's accesories.BEst regards nd keep on this way.JR                    I spent the last 6 months researching this camera and dreaming about having it. Finally, my dad bought it for me for Christmas. It is everything I hoped it would be.As an aspiring film maker, I was very interested in its 1080p abilities and functionality for adjusting ISO, Aperture, and Frame Rate individually - A feat Nikon hasn't offered.The stock 18-55mm lens is good, but its F3.5 leaves some things to be desired by someone hoping to capture a shallow depth of field. Luckily, the 50mm F/1.8 is only about $100.Overall, I would highly recommend this camera to anyone. Anyone in the world.Took this photo with the kit lens tonight, trying to capture the meteor shower.[...]                    got this camera before it said i would! its such an awsome camera! alot of buttons to learn! deff would recommend this to someone!                    im having a great time with this digital slr camera. i had spent some time researching cameras before I choose this one.It is working out well for me.                    I bought this because the T3 i had before got broke, and you can feel the difference between those two, what i don't like about this camera is that feels cheap in the hand, its made of plastic but it does the job with no trouble at all, the image quality is amazing, there is no need to Photoshop it.If you are planing to buy it take your times, because after i bought it it when about 150USD down and the T4i was at the same price i got this one, 649USD.                    The recipient loves it - I don't have any other feedback. decent price, but frustrating to see the price wars going on when I had already bought it and likely paid too much.                    I was so very happy to find such a great deal. I had expected some wear to the camera, but when I opened it, it looked as if it was used for 5 minutes and packed up! SO HAPPY!!!!! Thank you!
!###I'm a novice photographer.  I found this camera to be an easy one to get started with right off the bat.  I got a little confused with the directions for how to handle the menu settings at first and I still haven't figured out how to manage the flash (I've only been working with it for 10 days) but I was out shooting great pictures within two days. Clear and sharp on auto. Uploading them to the computer was a challenge.  I couldn't seem to find directions on how to do that.  I would have thought it would be an automatic plug in and something would show up on the screen deal.  Not so in my case.  The software is confusing but it looks like when I get used to it it will be really good.  It's hard to write a review on something when you've only had something like a camera for such a short time, but I bought it on the recommendation of my brother who has the T2i and I'm not sorry I did.  I really love it so far.                    Where do i start off? As an amateur, I guess I'll let the video quality speak for itself here. Let me tell you this camera has taken over my summer. Every chance I get I use it, I do. It features a wide array capabilities fit for experienced and beginning photographers. Its abilities are limitless. You can check out some my youtube channel for more "oceansidecreations" and make sure to hit like.Pros: Interchangeable lens, sensor and swivel screenCons: buttons, gripe, and low light.Bottom line:Love it, you'll get use to the buttons and small body. I got a tripod which made my life a lot easier. Another feature I love is the ability to edit video from your camera (trimming beginnings and endings). Editing is arguably the hardest part of filming. So the ability to trim down footage on the fly is beneficial. Also, The tilty swivel screen comes through all the time. As far as the 10x digital zoom goes, I can honestly say I hardly ever use it. If you have any other questions, please ask.I was conflicted between getting this and the 60D. I love the body design on the 60D, but wasn't feeling the extra debt for the same sensor. If you are an amateur, just grab the T3i. If you are an experienced photographer and use your camera more readily. Than I'd go with the 60D. Just keep in mind its due for an upgrade. Either way I love my camera and I back it 100 percent.                    Neither my family nor I are particularly adept at manual (some would say 'proper') photography.  I had received a Rebel film SLR years ago with the hope of taking it up as a hobby.  I can say, I've picked up photography as a hobby, but rather with a series of Canon digital point-n-shoots over the years.  The latest is an aging Ixus, the model number escapes me.  Yes, I'm rather fond of the Canon brand.  They have served me well shoved in countless pockets and packs throughout travels and tribulations.I ordered this camera two days before my wedding, figuring that the shots would necessarily be better than my point-n-shoot.  Amazon's Sunday delivery was exemplary and of good value.  I remembered the pre-sets on my original Rebel that could give instant access to better pictures without needing to understand apertures, etc. - I realize that's probably nails on a chalk board to some.  What I didn't intend on, was being absolutely floored by the stunning quality of shots that myself and all other family members (of much less experience snapping pics than I) were able to get on the day of our wedding.For those who are looking for an 'in' into the world of DSLR photography, this camera is easy to understand right out of the box.  And I promise to try to get f-stops, etc. to stick in my head this time for sure.  I can't wait to take this travelling!                    This is one hell of a camera!! As my wife commandeered my other camera (Rebel XSi/450D) I decided to invest in a newer version. I've not been disappointed in any way. Canon have significantly improved the information on each of the settings which will help anyone still learning. Also, the new Q function allowing you to change photo settings from one screen is brilliant. The pictures are incredible although I've only scratched the surface of it's capability thus far. It has a solid and robust feel without being overly heavy, and the battery life is the usual Canon excellent length. Wholeheartedly recommend this camera - it covers so many bases it'll suit most users.                    The T3i is an excellent dSLR. I am a serious amateur photographer with a focus (pun intended) on fine art photography. The T3i, with it's articulated LCD is very flexible in allowing me to hold the camera at extreme angles to take shots that were either impossible or very difficult with my previous Canon dSLR. The image quality is impressive. I have had this camera for about since mid-June. I have shot probably about 3,000 photos with it thus far. I have tried the T3i's video capability only briefly, so do not take my rating of the its video capability with much credence, but I like what I saw. If anyone wants to see any photos I shot with the T3i, here are a few photos I shot at the Philadelphia Zoo, [...] for a sample of the photos I shot recently at the Philadelphia Zoo.                    For a so called entry level camera the t3i does an excellent job.  If your primary interest is taking pictures and not getting all involved with gee whiz technology the t3i is the ticket.  I shoot exclusively in raw and aperture priority at mostly low ISO's.  IQ is very good using the kit 18-135.  I suspect IQ would be even better with a higher quality lens.The only occasional fault is missing focus once in a while.  Be sure it has something specific to focus on; don't just point out in the landscape and hope for the best.  Those who shoot people and events should never miss focus.                    Starting a small photo business and needed a back-up camera to my Canon 7D. Have really been impressed with the performance of the T3i. The large flip out screen is useful to get some dramatic shots from different angles. The light weight (compared to the 7D) is actually a bonus when hand holding the camera while taking video. Photo quality is superb especially at low light levels. Took wonderful action photos at the Phillies game last night using a Canon 18-200 lens on the T3i and a 3200 iso setting.                    My buying experience with Amazon hs been great.  The Canon T3I with an 18-135mm lens, for me, is the product I wanted at a price I was willing to pay. I recommend that any buyer of a DSLR establish what they want for features and set a price point they wish to pay, then do your research.  Make sure you buy from a reputable store whether on-line or brick & mortar.                    Very happy with the picture quality, great upgrade from P & S. T3i fits a smaller hand, 60D is a little bulky & heavy for me (personal preference). Decided to go with T3i instead of T4i and save the $300 diff. for a better lens.                    This is a really great camera and the pictures come out very clear with the stock 18-55 mm lens. If you have the camera on auto everything it does a really good job at well doing everything automatically. If you are on manual it is also pretty easy to use, but if your in a rush just use auto. The only reason why I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the movie mode has 1 major flaw like most dslr cameras do. The one thing I dislike is the noise it makes when you are autofocusing. This noise is heard in your video unless you buy an external microphone. If you already have an external mic then this is a really good 5 star camera :D Will so recommend this to anyone looking for an entry level dslr camera.
!###This product is great, it is cheap too! great reviews, great product, i have nothing much to say about it                    Cumpli&oacute; completamente mi expectativa de compra, llego en la fecha sin problemas de embalaje a mi casilla en Miami y desde ah&iacute; a mi direcci&oacute;n en Santiago de Chile, Am&eacute;rica del Sur                    This is a great camera. I am not a professional but the picture I shoot with the T3i came out amazing. Can say enough about this amazing camera.                    For a brown box camera the T3i was an excellent purchase.  The only problem I have had with the camera is the buttons sticking.                    The product has a great quality! I really recommend a Class 10 SD card to be able to record video! I use the camera for plane-spotting, so I use it with the 75-300mm lens. I think it was a great decision to buy it! Here you can see some of the pictures: [...]                    excellent product, I really liked'm very pleased with the purchase. . . . . . . . . . .                    One of the best cameras I've owned. Takes fabulous photos whether in standard or zoom. I only purchased the camera body as I already had a lens from another. I highly recommend it and also purchase from 6th Ave. Express. Thanks for a great buy.                    This camera could not be better. We use it ALL the time, and the photo quality is just unbelievable. Definitely, definitely recommend!                    This was my first dSLR camera purchase, and I have been delighted with the photos and video from it. However, after less than a year of very light use, the autofocus feature of the (EF-S 18-55 mm f/3.5-5.6 IS) lens stopped working.  None of the troubleshooting techniques suggested in the owner manual corrected the problem, so I assume the problem is permanent.  Regardless, I expected higher quality and durability from this product. Currently awaiting a reply from Canon regarding this issue to see how their customer service handles it.                    T3i is the AE1 of DSLRs. Can I fir any more acronyms in here? Sorry. But this is a classic camera, hitting the perfect sweet spot of affordability and features.
!###I'm not a professional photografer, but the quallities of Photoshop are amazing. I love it! The more famous camera today.                    I have used this to record 2 weddings and take 1000's of pictures. still learning but it has done a great job for me. thanks                    This is a mid size DSLR professional camera with impressive and high quality photos. Longer life battery (over 400 shots), versatil with full articulated LCD display; low noise in higher ISO levels. Recommended five stars                    Is my first srl camera and is very simple to use with excellent results. The product met all my expectations                    makes me want another, will be getting a second t3ithank you.  neatly packed thought it was still new.thank you so much, really fast service.carol                    This camera replaced a Canon Rebel 35mm. It is surprising how similiar they are. So far it works GREAT. Only had the camera for a few days so this is not a far review.  The weight and balance is right on. I like the features. I can not believe for the sale price of the item, It does not come with a memory card. It works great with my old lenses. The shipping service from Amazon was excellent , order one day get it the next for free. Nice camera.                    I have had several digital cameras but this is my first DSLR. I bought it on recommendation of a friend who has much experience with photography. I wish I had purchased a bundle with a macro lens because close ups are my favorite and the standard lens doesn't let me get the really closeup pictures. It's easy to use and easy to learn.The only down side for me is that the software is not supported by my Mac Book Pro yet so I can't use the software that came with the camera.                    I got this camera for a cousin of mine. It takes amazing pictures. He is using it for photoshoots etc.                    Camera came before it was scheduled to arrive, in wonderful condition!! The price was very good also :) I was really nervous about everything, but I am so happy that I bought the item                    The equipament has a problem. Is in Canon to fix &#34;Err 06&#34;.Two weeks of use and the problem ocurred.
!###I love my new camera. It does everything it's supposed to and does it with precision. Truly worth the money.                    Not as heavy as I thought. Starting up speed is fast. Easy to use and understand the buttons. Great for beginner dslr users.                    Takes superior photographs, Videos look epic using a cinematic 24fps setting (Can be tweaked around), Great for beginners or intermediate photographers, a fantastic camera so far! I will report in the next few months to give an update about the T3i (600D).                    I live in a country where buying brand new stuff is a hustle but getting such a deal online is one hell a fantastic one... I luv my piece in fact it was like new... great deals guys! thumbs up to you....IceZambia                    This is an absolutely great buy for anyone moving into DSLR cameras and I look forward to improving my picture taking experiences with this!                    I love this camera...except recently it's started to give me a little bit of trouble, it's not as fast as when I first got it.                    Well, like many others, this is my first dSLR.  I also bought the book by Jeff Revell, which has really helped me to actually understand this camera.  I did take a photography class back in the day, but the book was a huge help in understanding digital and reminding me things I had forgotten.  I would recommend it.Back to the camera - wow.  I have had a Canon S5IS for a few years and its been nice.  Nothing compared to the photos I can get with this.  Very happy so far.                    I recently received mine and so far I love it. Its very light and it takes descent pictures. I just started to get into photography and this one is definitely recommended for beginners. Can't complain so far....really handy and easy to take quick shots....                    I really like  my new camera ,i feel like I'm a professional photographer,but I have to study and read  the manual first..                    I really love it. The quality  image is 18 pixels as promised. The EOS rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camara is superb.
!###Can't beat the quality of pictures and shutter speed for the price! Perfect for anyone wanting great pictures with lots of easy to use settings.                    I was looking for a great entry into video and photography for home use (1 year old) as well as helping on occasion shoot weddings, short films, and commercials for a budding professional locally. I love all of the buttons and this was my first exposure to the SLRs. I've always been very tech savvy, but it's taken me the better part of a year to really figure out how best to work this thing. I shoot always in AV mode and that seems to work best for most situations. Additionally, the abilty to shoot RAW + JPEG was nice as I rarely need the RAW photos but if something looks extra &#34;special&#34; then I can edit it without having to go back and re-shoot it.                    As an amateur photographer, this little guy is perfect. It can do so much for somebody who spends time trying to figure out how to frame a shot (love the fold-out screen!) OR how to bring out the aspects of a good photographer (I spend most of my time flipping between aperture control and some of the &#34;creative&#34; modes!).18MP is enough to edit with and still make a decent print, and this camera will help you learn all the basic tricks of the pros. I'd love to move up some day, but for right now I think spending some dollars on a few nice L-series lenses will get me further than a new body would.Enjoy!                    What's not to like?I bought this as an extra for my video shooting, though of course it takes lovely still photos as well.But I've never been disappointed with my T3i experiences, especially for the price.And that's all I've got to say about that.                    Come on, it's a Rebel! Great camera for the price! Only reason to not like it is if you're a Nikon junky.                    The Canon Rebel T3i is a great starting point for aspiring photographers and videographers. It's not too expensive, and it performs extremely well. However, this camera is better suited for photograhy, as indicated by the slightly restricted menu in movie mode. For photography, you have full manual control over pretty much every aspect of your shot, whereas in movie mode, there seem to be a few things missing.Nonetheless, it shoots very well, with no complaints. Just make sure you get your shutter angle at 180 degrees and your videos will look flawless.My only qualm is that at 60fps, the video doesn't record very smoothly, even with my 80mb/s SD card. There are a few glitches in the video, but it still looks fairly well.I got this camera with the kit lens, and it works, at least. You do get what you pay for, so sometimes it's not all that sharp and the autofocus is none too reliable. I have been able to get good pictures and video with it, though.Overall, this camera is great for someone just starting out, as it offers great quality video and photographs for a reasonable price. I highly recommend it as the step before going to the 70D or even the 7D.                    I'm taking a beginner photography class. This is a great little camera right out of the box set on automatic. I am looking forward to learning all of the manual settings.                    This was a 21st birthday gift for our daughter and she absolutely loves it!  She did a photo shoot of her own baby daughter for a friend's Etsy business.  The friend was so impressed with the pictures that she bought the same camera.  We all were thrilled with the pictures.                    I am 13 years old, and am a avid filmmaker. I decided to go with the T3i(I thought of buying the 60D, but it was out of my budget), and I LOVE IT! It came in the mail about 2 weeks ago(as my birthday present) so it's gotten some heavy use already. The battery charges very fast, but it is a new battery, so go figure! I'm fine with the lens(18-55), but I am definitely wanting to purchase a different one, like the 50mm f/1.8 or a Minolta MD 50mm f1.7. Overall, It's a great camera. It is pretty good for photography, and video as well. Of course, there are plenty of more expensive cameras out there with better capabilities, but for the price it's wonderful!                    I'm a film maker and this makes a better than good b cam. Canon quality, nice matte finish, audio meter function so you don't have to worry about auto peaking. I'd buy a fleet of these if I had the money.
!###Just what one expects of this product. Great Camera and fun stuff. Its great that I got just what I saw on the pictures.                    I was happy to find this camera and lens on here, after seeing how expensive it was everywhere else. The item was in its original packaging (brand new) and works like a dream...                    Very happy with this camera. It came fast and works great. I've used it for a few shoots so far and I'm very happy with the quaintly. Also very easy to use.                    This is my first DSLR camera.  I switched from point and shoot to a bridge camera (Sony DSC HX200V) to DSLR.  I've had it for 9 months and have taken 2000+ photos with it.  It's been a great camera from the start: beautiful image rendering (not blotchy like the Sony even though they have same pixel size), really good with low light situations (I recommend using a tripod), intuitive user interface, and fairly sharp images with kit lens and the Canon 55-250mm lens.  The price for this camera is good for the quality, especially for a DSLR beginner or amateur.  I chose this over some Nikon cameras because it felt more intuitive and comfortable, especially with smaller hands.  The live view with vari-angle screen is nice.  It allowed me to take shots at awkward angles easily.  However, I don't use Live View or auto-focus often because using auto-focus and with Live View takes a long time to focus and capture images, even after I've adjusted Live View shooting modes/options.  Sometimes the camera will not capture/record the image if it can't focus.  I've missed many shots because of this.  You'll need to switch to manual focus and/or not use Live View.  The battery life is pretty good for this camera - about 350-400 images (~3 hours of shooting time).  After market batteries work just as well as Canon batteries and are way cheaper and more affordable.  The Polaroid macro filters available on Amazon are a nice and inexpensive addition to your kit (~$15).  It's allowed me to take some really nice macro shots with the kit lens and allows me to cut the minimum distance for the zoom lens (makes it much easier to shoot indoors with zoom lens).  Overall, I'm quite pleased with this camera as it's easy to use and comfortable to carry around.  I rate it a 4.5/5 stars due to the issue with Live View and auto-focus.                    I upgraded to this from a Canon Rebel XS. My favorite camera so far. I recommend this camera to anyone. Beginners and professionals.                    This is my first DSLR camera.  I have always had a point and shoot.  But this camera takes some amazing pictures.  It is a great beginners camera also because it explains everything to you itself :)  The quality of the pictures is so much better than what I am used to taking.  I had a Nikon Coolpix 6300 as my last camera.  It takes good pics for what it is but this Rebel T3i shows me what I was missing :)                    Wanted one for a while and it was everything I;ve come to expect from canon.Would highly recommend to anyone looking to record there memories.                    I love this camera.  I thought the lens that came with it was enough.  I have ordered a second for sports and animals photos.  Great camera.                    Enjoying taking pictures, but not making a lucrative living at it, this camera fit the bill, and my budget. It takes very good quality images, still and video, and is full of features which you find in the higher end models. Its auto sensor cleaning is a nice touch, which activates upon shutting the camera off. Great camera!                    I would last ages describing everything I liked on this camera. I am an advanced amateur and this is my forth digital and I will stay on it; no more changes for a good time. The only upgrade I really needed was the Magic Lantern firmware (release 2.3) and I have more equipment than I ever wanted. I recommend to take advantage of the price reduction now that the T4i is available...
!###I'm not a pro with photo cameras, but the pictures i took were amazing, just from the very begining using it.                    Can you take a bad picture with this camera? Nope! Love this camera. I bought this camera at best buy, not amazon, I wanted the camera that day not have to wait for shipping, sorry amazon. I did a lot of research when looking for a new camera, I have had plenty of point and shoots. I figured I would look at the next level. I enjoy taking photos and wanted to take better photos. I looked at many different brands and saw this one as being more user friendly.I went to many different places to try out the cameras in real life and I went through a lot of online articles to look for the perfect camera. This one seemed to win throughout. When I got the camera of course I took a ton of pictures just to try it out, so far I have mostly been doing the auto features, I am experimenting with the manual setting too, I have only had the camera for a month and still getting used to the manual settings. I am trying to still get the manual settings down pat, but it worth it to take that perfect picture. At first I thought this camera would be to much camera for me, from going a point and shoot to this camera. Its not to much camera for me and my family, its perfect. If you're looking for a new camera that is a step up from a point and shoot this is perfect for you. I do have to say one thing,play around with manual settings, you will take not so great pictures while getting used to the settings, but its definetly worth it.                    I have taken some pictures with the camera and I have to say the pictures are a lot clearer than my old camera                    This Camera is very easy to use, it has all to pro features at a good price. LOve that I can use my lenses I purchased for my D300 7 years ago. If you like to get into photography this is the Camera to go for. The HD video is of exceptional quality.                    I've been on the market for a C-camera i can use for events, interviews, and other projects where I need multiple angles.  I own a 5DII and and T2i and I needed something inexpensive that would work beautifully with the footage from those cameras.  My first thought was to get a small point and shoot with quality video that I could just throw on a tripod and let it go for a good wide angle shot.  However, the price points weren't too far off from this gem right here.  Being that I already have lenses for my Canon DSLR's, I decided to go with this.  Needless to say, I love it. The articulating LCD screen is a super plus that I was missing with my T2i and it's really helpful in capturing those low and high angle shots I love.                    It's my first DSLR. Been using it for the past two weeks with no regrets at all.... The reviews I've read all over were very similar and true to form. I'm glad I went with the 18-135mm as opposed to the 18-55mm which most folks have as a standard lens.Go get one of these! :-)                    Bought this for my wife for her birthday.  She likes to take pictures of birds and was not getting the quality shots with the simpler cameras, this one with the 55-200 IS lens has been perfect.  Very easy to use and pictures are outstanding.  I used it myself for the first time a couple of weekends ago, and being someone who has never taken many pictures was able to get some wonderful action pics of an inline marathon.  Can't say how it compares to other cameras in this range, but for an inexperienced person looking to upgrade and get some better shots I would definetly recommend this camera.                    I don't know much about photography, but I wanted something legit to do my own headshots and Christmas cards. I've only experimented for about 5 minutes, and I can already tell this camera is a dream. I'm very very happy with the purchase, and the quality of everything. I look forward to years of use!                    I'm having a blast using this camera. The pictures are great, and no issues what so ever. I've taken all sorts of pictures and all have turned out great                    This is a great starter camera and gives you a lot of room to grow with different lenses. It is easy to use and my pictures have turned out amazing.
!###I bought this camera for the video feature.  The colors are beautiful and the autofocus during shooting video is silent.  I use the autofocus sometimes, but usually stick to manual because most of my video work is not working with lots of depth of field.  The sound is great through the camera, but I love the mic input!As far as photography, the autofocus is too finicky.  However, most of the time I use the manual focus anyways.  Great camera for the money!!!                    I bought this for my husband as a gift in July. He picked this camera because of its high quality video and it takes good photos. He says it is an amazing camera and is user-friendly.                    This is an awesome camera for the money. Does everything I need it to do and more. I highly recommend it for all who are looking for a great digital SLR camera.                    Just make sure you know you will have to buy a memory card, $35-$85, depending on how much storage you will need. Arrived very quickly.                    Did my research and boy am I happy with this bad boy. Super easy for a rookie like me to learn and even in the beginning had great pictures (no thanks to any skill on my part). Definitely glad I bought the lens separate -- ended up getting a Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens. Much better then the lenses that come in the bundle.Also got a bigger memory card to hold even more pictures.I had read reviews about the battery life being so-so but it has been great for me. I have gone on a week vacation and took pictures every day and the battery lasted the whole time without charging.                    I bought this camera due to Consumer Reports. They gave it a thumbs up, very easy to use for a beginner like me. Takes awesome pictures. The only thing I would consider is buying a zoom lens.                    First, let me start off by saying I'm not a professional photographer and this review will not focus on the technical specifications.This is my first DSLR. My previous digital camera was a point and shoot style. We had been debating taking the plunge and purchasing a DSLR camera. Here are some of the highlights.Value: If you keep an eye out you may be able to purchase the camera in conjunction with an extra lens rebate deal. This is how I got the camera and the total package was a bargain.User Friendly: A DSLR can be intimidating with all of the buttons and options available. The camera is setup to handle a beginner from day one. All of the menus have clear explanations of the functions. The camera has a fully automatic mode. This means it can operate like your point and shoot camera until you learn the extra features. There are also separate auto functions that allow you to make some adjustments without going fully manual.Focus: The focus speed and quality is incredible with a camera like this. It&#8217;s great for taking pictures of kids. You can easily capture several shots in a row of that special moment. There&#8217;s no waiting for a slow point and shoot to achieve focus.HD Video: The camera can also function as a camcorder. The recording quality is HD. The camera has a fold out/tilting screen to make video recording easier.Battery Life: The battery life is incredible. If you use the eye piece for shooting and the LCD only for viewing the shot the battery can easily last long enough that you&#8217;ll forget when it was charged last.We&#8217;re extremely happy that we went with the T3i. It&#8217;s been getting continual use since our son was born in the hospital. We used it to do our own newborn photo shoot. All of our family and friends were impressed with the pictures on our announcements and thank you cards.                    I LOVE this camera!  I'm still trying to get used to all the wonderful features since this is my first DSLR, but it's so much better than I expected, even when taking pics in the dummy modes.                    This is my first dSLR.  I am in my mid-forties so I recall what it was like to use a fine SLR and this camera brings me back to that golden era, except better.  I can't believe how crisp the photos look and the manual settings are superb.  I realize how the last decade of digital point and shoots has made me settle for out of focus washed out images.My biggest complaint is that I have trouble locating the camera because it is inevitably squirreled away in one of my kid's rooms.  they feel that this camera has opened up a new world of observation and expression.We shoot in RAW and edit in Photoshop Elements.You will soon want a telephoto lens.                    I went from the Canon XTI 10.1mp to this Amazing T3I 18.0mp. I'm blown away by the difference and by todays technology! I had no idea that cameras come with built in filters now. Here I am lugging around this big bag with all these extra pcs. Don't get me wrong old school filters are still the better, but simplifying my life is the new norm! So glad I broke down and got this!
!###Did everything Canon claimed it would, and more I really like everything about it Met all my expectations to the  fullest                    The camera is fine but in case there is a rebate, Canon tries everything to not honore that. So it is better to avoid any rebate issues with canon..Sucks                    I cannot give an ultimate review at the moment, because I haven't taken a complete test run.  But I know from looking at the menu and specs I really like my Pentax K-X.  The software with this camera is bland and not as advanced. It only offers a few filter options, including Toy Camera, Fisheye (which a lens is better anyway), Black and white.  I have read reviews and have heard that Canon's have more "noise" in the pictures, so hopefully I do not notice this.  I know sometimes my Pentax can cast a slight grey tint to it, I'm hoping with a Canon I do not have this conflict.  I purchased this camera to escape my comfortzone from my Pentax addiction, but I'm pretty sure in most cases I will use my Pentax.  Once I take a test run, I will further update, and I'm only judging by the software that is on the camera I am not impressed.  The camera is lightweight, the lens isn't that wonderful (but then again, I have always had Pentax lenses, so I'm trying to be open about the change).  I have purchased an adapter but still am debating on the first lens to buy for this camera.  The functions as in processing of the a picture is amazingly fast, I am impressed by that.  I am excited about the 18 MP!  I'll follow up once I get a session in and maybe post some pictures.  This is my first Canon SLR I have ever used, so bare with me.Update:I hate it.  I am returning it, the lens broke too cheaply constructed for me. Sorry Canon you lose.                    T3i seems to be much more advertise I am impress of all its capabilities same as 60d but one thing that discourage me on this camera is that the manual controls is totally for consumer type and its really a lousy camera if your going for professional. I know a lot of you is gonna say like this "I'm not a pro anyway..." yeah right trust me I own 500d coz I thought like that.. when I check out the controls on 550d and 600d are all the same..  the 60d is much more better for photography and videography because of its manual controls same like 7d and almost 5d mark 2 it may be expensive but its worth the price and I'm using for my production.well it's your choice at least you heard my opinion. oH before I forget the zooming feature while on video on 600d.. doesnt really impress coz I prefer lens zoom because it makes thoseCanon EOS 60D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD and 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS UD Standard Zoom Lens pixels intact.                    This camera Could not be focused. All pictures that i took were out of focus. I tried for a month. I do not know if it is the camera or the lens. I returned the camera, even though the thirty days had passed by two days when I last tried it on Siunday with poor results.                    The camera is great and works like a champ, but I wish there were actual training videos that comes with it. This T3i is great for me, it is kind of complicated at first but after you get the hang of navigating the menus, it delivers the photos you want with brilliance and precision. However, When I made this purchase. I could of sworn this item said it was going to be coming with a camera backpack and an 8 GB memory card. Neither of these things were in the box.                    If you only use the view finder to shoot and forgot to insert memory card, it does not warn you, and allow you to shoot hundreds of blank pictures...
!###Able to capture every facial expression during special moments, auto focus takes all the guess work out and focuses on the person and shades appropriately backround objects.                    This is my first SLR and been using this baby every weekend for hiking and nature shots. Shots are very clear and nice. Am sticking with Canon                    I have bought this for AP. Very good sensor, makes great images. it is very nice, light, portable and over all great camera.                    This is my first &#34;nice&#34; camera. I wanted to get something that I can have for years and can just keep improving. The quality is excellent and it's not too hard to get used too. I definitely recommend it.                    Def great for pictures, lots of features. main reason I bought it was cause this one unlike the T3, has manual control over video settings. BE AWARE if thats one reason you want or choose it.... make sure you have light. lots of fuzz will start to appear with 800 iso. i can't emphasize YOU NEED LIGHT COMING FROM EVERYWHERE! def a good for beginners or experts.                    This camera is a lot better than you think.The images from video and photo CAN be outstanding and even compare to the nicer end camers in the $3,000 range.Just make sure you learn the camera and have a few lenses. The kit lens is great too don't listen to the other people that tell you its bad.Check out my videos with the T3iMy YouTube chanel is SooperHBOMB                    For $500, this is a steal. The HD video mode is a great start for videography if you use it right and have the right lenses and audio recorder. The pictures come out great too. Make sure you get the right, high quality lenses because those make a huge difference.                    This is a great camera for beginners like me. It is easy to use and very light. I recommend it. Delivery was also not bad.                    I am in love with this camera. I am not an expert by any means but I have been having so much fun with my camera. Its a good camera to learn on!                    Bought this camera to replace an older Rebel camera and this camera takes amazing pictures. Does not matter what lense you have on it.  I would for sure tell anyone to invest in this camera
!###this is my third canon camera....two were small digital cameras but this is my first digital SLR and after using it a week Ifind I am getting excellent results ....still learning where all the buttons are but no complaints. The battery lasts a long timeand I purshased an extra and find this keeps me always ready to take a picture...It is light weight too and that is nice.                    I liked the Pro-shot a lot but it was getting on in age and then I left it in a restaurant in Alabama and of course no one had any knowledge about the missing camera. I had been looking at a Rebel for some time. I read Consumers Report on cameras and that helped me get this particular model. I love the big screen to view what I had taken and the 18 Megapixels really give a sharp photo.I was disappointed that Canon did not include how to connect the camera to a computer in the instruction manual. I am always nervous when trying something electrical without instructions. I really didn't want to fry my new purchase. Everything came up roses and now I am getting ready to really work it over on a long trip to Europe. Thanks, Kerald Yearns                    I got this camera because I'm a inspiring Video Director/ Producer and I wanted to up grade to a good DSLR for HD purpose and this camera with its mulitiple lens capability fix my needs and wallet!                    Five weeks old and it's a veteran! 4,371 photos so far! This camera has not put a foot wrong as yet. It shot 1730 photos in its first weekend of service and the only bad ones were photo bombs and some where I had not noticed that my flash batteries had died! Ste it on AUTO and mash the gas!                    I upgraded from a point and shoot camera. I'm loving my T3i. It takes awesome photos. Im learning to customize it with accesories such as speedlite, battery grip, and telephoto lens.                    My wife loves it and that makes me very happy, when my wife is happy, I'm happy. It takes great pictures, we down loaded all the pictures to our computer and NOT ONE BAD PICTURE.                    The T3i has everything a photographer or filmmaker is looking for in an entry-level DSLR.  Great interchangeable lenses, kit lens with decent aperture settings, awesome quality video, manual control over everything, and much more.  I absolutely love this camera for everything.  In my opinion, this is a better buy than the T4i unless you need a touchscreen or automatic autofocus.                    After years of frustration with Point and Shoots I took a big step forward and purchased T3i with 18-55 Lens. Within 5 minutes of opening the box I was taking pictures. It took me couple of days to get adjusted to its size and weight. I have used the camera a lot for 10 days now with several manual settings. So far I am quite impressed with picture quality but not amazed. I thought camera should take better pictures. That could be due to the fact that I am new to DSLRs and also the included Kit Lens has some limitations. I may buy the nifty fifty and see how good the pictures turn out.UPDATE - Changing the rating to 5 stars. Amazing camera. The only regret I have is purchasing it with 18-55 mm lens. I should have purchased body only. 18-55 is good for nothing lens. I ended up buying 55-250 zoom lens which is awesome and 40 mm STM which perfect for closeup shots and videos. Nifty fifty was extremely poor quality.                    I love this camera, I bought it off craigslist from someone who bought it from here. They had hardly used it and needed the money. I bought it with the 15-55mm kit lens, I believe that's the one. I left some of my favorite pictures on here so hopefully you will be able to see the beautiful professional pictures I was able to get with this camera, even with the kit lens. Any questions, please feel free to ask.I've owned this camera about about 2-3 months now.                    I was tired of the point-and-shoots and needed a camera I can depend on to catch my kids teams in action. Well the first weekend I got this camera, I couldn't believe the quality of the photos it could take. I spent the weekend experimenting and I couldn't be happier with the  quality of the still shots.  beautifully clear and richer than anything that I've gotten from a point-and-shoot and the ability of this camera to capture action shots is stunning thank you Canpn
!###Yes, I really love it.  I don't like leaving home without it.This camera took my interest in photography to a whole new level.  It takes wonderful pictures.  It's solidly constructed.  The menus are well-designed.  The setup of the controls is well-thought out.If you are new to DSLR, this is a great camera to start with.  However, be aware that once you cross the line into DSLR, it can be a never-ending drain on your wallet, between lenses and accessories.I got some dust on my sensor within only a few months of purchase.  This seems to be inevitable as best I can tell if you have multiple lenses.  It was a bit concerning, as there isn't a lot of documentation on how to fix this problem.  I ultimately bought a sensor cleaning kit and was able to clean it after several tries.There are a gazillion lenses to choose from.  I would consider buying just the camera body and purchase a Canon EF-S 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Standard Zoom Lens for Canon DSLR Cameras.  This is the perfect "walk-around" lens, as it gives you a great range from wide-angle through telephoto.  The less you have to change lenses, the better (see above).                    The Rebel T3i / 600D is exactly the camera that you will expect it to be.  Feature-rich, reasonably priced, enjoyable to use and, most importantly, takes really great pictures. It's not a particularly innovative camera but it is a generally well planned one. Unlike the original Rebel / 300D, the T3i doesn't sit in isolation - there are plenty of options including the increasingly competitive mirrorless and auto focusing during live view video T4i / 650D seen here...http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00894YWD0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00894YWD0&linkCode=as2&tag=stupisms-20However, in keeping with previous models in the range, it's an impressive camera for the money and it's hard not to imagine owners loving theirs.                    I'm an entry level DSLR user and took a class with my new camera.  It's great and easy to use and once you learn to use your manual adjustments you can take quite excellent pictures!  The coloring is great and I can't wait to take more pictures with it!                    I bought this camera because I wanted a dslr for underwater pictures. Unlike other dslrs, this camera has a lower priced high quality underwater housing available. Pair this with a great fish eye and macro lens and you are setup for blowing bubbles and shooting pictures!                    I make youtube videos, and since ive had this camera my videos have been amazing. Perfect for beginners, and professionals!!                    The Canon rebel t3i is a great SLR camera.  It has many features that allow for professional photography.  The manual mode is easy to use and change the aperture speed, shutter speed, exposure,etc. One thing I would say though is the flash is a little bit weak.                    It has far exceeded my expectation from a beginnner DSLR camera! It is right for the price of it you won't regret it.                    Canon quality Canon engineering Canon value all in one very neat package very versatile lots of accessories available BUY BUY                    I'm just starting to develop my skills (or not) as an amateur photographer, and this camara is an excelent tool to start with. It is really easy to use, very intuitive, fast, light ( for been a reflex), the battery has never let me down, The only thing is that you may be a bit short with the lens, but is just a detail.I'm realy happy with my new camara.                    I Love Photography and just had to get this camera. Never mind the price, great item. I Highly recommend this.
!###It's an awesome camera, I really love it. I can't wait to take a million pictures with it, thank you.                    I have always had Canon cameras and this one doesn't disappoint! Takes a great picture and fairly easy to use.                    I gave this camera to my daughter for Christmas. She seems very pleased with it. It is obviously still new and I hope it will pass the test of time...                    This camera was my first move from a Cannon point and shoot to the SLR realm.  A seasoned pro might feel otherwise, but for me this is a fantastic camera.  I was able to take great shots on the first few tries with simple objects around the house.  Once I took it outdoors, it really took some great photos as well.  There are enough settings on this camera to keep me busy for a long time, and I am using it to create professionally-produced prints for sale to the public, so I am confident that it will prove to be a valuable purchase for me.  The instruction manual was also one of the better ones I have read in a long time, and despite some of the criticisms I have read about the included lens, all in all I can't say enough good things about it.                    This is  my 6 th  DSLR from Canon  my first Rebel  since all the others  consider higher grade cameras  such has my 5ds that are full frame. I really like the camera and its performance. Focusing and shooting are fun & terrific. The only draw back is the camera does not have the durability of body as do the higher end camera of Canon.  However, considering the price of a little over $ 500.00I got a great camera to compliment my equipment.  An 18 megapixal camera with lightning focusing and great results that allows me with the 1.6 conversion factor use my 300 MM to get wildlife and also use my L lens getting excellant results.I usually shoot in aperture priority especially with all my nature and outdoor photo work.                    The rebel t3i delivers, for the money. Before this camera I used a Panasonic Lumix. (which is also a very good camera) The T3i is no doubt THE camera for beginning DSLR camera users, people just getting into the hobby, but don't want a cheaper 100$ point and shoot camera. The picture quality is no doubt amazing, the 18 megapixel sensor delivers exceptional performance. I'll upload some pictures that I've taken with it. For beginners, I strongly recommend auto settings for your pictures until you get used to the camera, and want to experiment around. The T3i is not a hard camera to master. In fact, all you need is a full battery and a good lens, and you're all set, just switch it to auto and shoot away. The screen on the body of the camera is also very high quality, on my 20d, the screen is very small and dark, therefore very hard to see in the sunlight. The T3i screen is very bright so it is very easy to see. The ports on the camera include a micro hdmi port, digital av (cable included) an SD card slot, the main storage for all your photos, a 3.5 mm headphone port and another port that I'm not sure what it is. Also on the camera is pretty good flash and a (slot?) for another flash. Overall this camera is the camera for the money, excellent.                    This camera is outstanding.  I can't say more than what others have already said, but I will say this.. the day it came I unpackaged it, took a couple test pictures and said &#34;I can't believe I waited this long to buy a decent camera&#34;.  Said it outloud, and I live alone !!About 2 weeks after I purchased this camera, the T4i came out.  I thought about returning this and ordering the T4i, but this one serves my purposes and then some.I love this camera, already have over 4,000 shots on it!!!                    So far, I've found that I cannot take a bad photo with this camera.  I opted for the 18-135 lens, remembering that this is about double for the older lenses of the regular 35mm age (at least, I think it's about 36 to 270 mm standard?).  Someone can correct me if I'm wrong.  Anyway, I like having the versatile lens rather than changing lenses every time I want to do a more telephotic shot.  Anyway, on automatic settings, works beautifully . . . none of that hesitation that I used to get with my Olympus.  Also, like the feature that you can just turn the wheel on top to take non-flash photos (instead of having to go to the menu to do so).  Low light photos are amazing, and the flash doesn't usually wash out the photo.  So far (only had this camera for a month now), has performed well for holiday photos.  I'm looking forward to traveling with this camera (it is a bit heavier than I was used to with my Olympus, but mostly due to the larger lens, I believe).                    I purchased this camera as a gift for my daughter.  This is her second Canon camera and she really pleased with this model.                    I will preface this review by stating that I am not a camera expert and am still learning much of the functionality of this camera.  I do know the concepts of white balance, aperture, frame rate, f stops, shutter speed and other functions however, I am not all that familiar on their use and which settings are best for which shots.  I have worked with a higher end video camera and do know some things about shot composition and such, but again, only at a basic level.All that being said, here is my review.A simple two-sentence, simple, bottom line review: This camera allows me to capture ideas and shots, even in automatic mode, that if attempted with a simple point and shoot camera would look like garbage.  It has enabled me to make ideas I've had in the past into a reality which makes it worth the money.OK, so maybe that doesn't cut it for an in-depth review.The Canon T3i has a fairly rugged design and feels good in the hand.  It does not feel as heavy as it looks and has a variety of easy-to-access controls for adjusting all manner of settings and features on the camera.The camera is simple enough for a beginner to take a quick glance at the included guide, throw it into Automatic + mode and capture some great shots right out of the box.  However, it is also complex enough that a more skilled photographer or someone who wants to become one will have all the room they need to compose magazine-worthy works of art.The lens that comes with the camera, the EF-S 18-55mm is a great starter lens for medium to close up shots.  My wife and I purchased this camera from another retailer along with a Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS II Telephoto Zoom Lens.A WARNING: To those hunting for great deals out there, do not be duped into getting a package deal with a poor telephoto lens as an add-on.  Always research what you are getting, otherwise you can end up with a cheap telephoto lens that has no image stabilization.  Image stabilization is what keeps the lens and image balanced and is an absolute must for a telephoto lens.The above lenses are of the same family and will give the average photographer the variety they will need to accommodate the majority of the shots they will be taking.  However, Canon also has an extensive line of lenses in their EF and EFS family that will fit this camera body for higher image quality or specialized uses.The photo quality is superb.  The average user will be satisfied with the 18megapixel image compressed as a 5MB Jpeg file.  Advanced users will love the access to Canon's RAW format, which is literally the digital picture data as captured by the image sensor in the camera.  This allows for advanced tweaking and manipulation of the photo.The T3i does have a full 1080p HD video mode, however, I have not used it at this point in time and cannot review it for that reason.  However, I can say that if the image quality of the still images are indicative of the picture quality of the HD video, it will be a treat.Overall, I will say that this camera is well worth the money for someone looking to take a step up from the dull world of point and shoot.  It will give a user room to grow and learn more about photography.  For more advanced users it is a great mid-range option that has a huge level of control over shots.  That being said, this camera, like any tool, is only as good as its user.  The A+ mode will allow for pretty good shots without adjusting settings, however, a user will get the most out of it by learning more about photography and delving into the full feature set of the camera.
!###This is a great camera. It's fast and the pics are great. We are beginner level and bought it to take pics of our kids. It's great!                    This camera is perfect!!! All the features are great and easy to use. Purchased for my wife for Christmas and she has not put it down since she got it. Highly recommended!!!                    Camera is awesome and worth the money... great deal...excellent pic quality... love all the features especially the screen that comes out of the camera and u can rotate it...                    I bought this camera to myself as my own Christmas present. I love it, i think it is great for amateurs who are learning how to take great photos. With this camera I became more interested and motivated to take better photos. I also bought few more lenses and I Can't wait to see how much I can do with it..                    I bought this as an entry level DSLR. I'm no professional by any means, but I know enough to figure out why I got a bad shot and make the necessary adjustments to get a better one. This camera has met and exceeded all of my expectations. I certainly have a lot to learn about it still, however it didn't take long for me to figure out the main aspects of all the settings. Its comfortable to hold and carry, and the picture quality is amazing. I'm more of a family portrait shooter as well as just capturing family memories, so I don't use this to take artistic photos by any means, however after playing with it for a while I can see how it would be easy to start learning how to do that as well. So far my favorite feature is the wireless shutter release. Nothing makes the holidays photos as much fun now that I don't have to worry about setting that stupid timer and hoping that i run to the group in time for the shot. Now I can just enjoy the moment take as many photos in as little time necessary to achieve the perfect group shot. I love it!  If you're a person thats ever used the self timer alot, the remote should be a must added accessory!                    I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a reasonably priced DSLR with some great capabilities. I ordered this one over the t4i, not only because of the pricing differences but because of the similarities of the functions. The t3i is about 3 steps ahead of the t3, and is right on par with the t4i. The tilting screen is great for showing off pictures without getting crowded, and the manual settings are great and easily fixed to how they are needed.                    If you are looking for the latest and most cutting edge intro DSLR then look at the new rebel T4i. However since canon launched the T4i the price has dropped even further making this an even better value then it was before. This is an excellent camera if you are looking to take your photography to the next level. However it is important to note what a DSLR will and won't do for you.It Will:-Give you better looking pictures. Even just taking pictures on Auto you can get some spectacular shots.-Allow you to &#34;take off the training wheels&#34; and have full control over your pictures-Expand your shooting capabilities with lenses for every occasion.It Won't:-Automatically make all your pictures great. You still need to compose and pick your shots.-Give you the portability of a Point-and-Shoot camera.The body of the camera is very well constructed, the buttons are all easy to reach and the live view screen is great for composing and reviewing your shots. All the advanced functionality you'd expect is there, though some of it is buried deep in the options menus. However the manual clearly explains where to find everything, so if you don't know something the manual is actually helpful in most cases.                    this dslr is very good for filming. the flip out screen makes it so much easier, i am very happy with this camera                    I use this camera primarily for film. Beautiful picture, crisp and pristine clarity. Great for trying new lenses out and the photography options a great for anyone from beginners to professionals.                    An awesome light-weight camera with great images and color. I love the feel and size of this camera, and am extremely pleased with the images it produces.
!###I upgraded from a Canon XTi so I had lenses for the camera.  It takes great pictures and I have been trying out the different settings.  I'm not sure if I like the live view at this time but it will probably take some getting used to.  I used the video capabilities and was quite impressed (after I read the instructions).  As with any new camera, read the Manual and it will work as it should.                    I've always wanted to get into photo and so I decided to get into a photo class and the T3i was the camera I bought to get me started. I love this camera!! Is quite good for a semi-pro and it got soooo much better once i got her a new lens. It's fairly easy to use (although the user's manual is not very friendly in my opinion, i took a basic class and learned a lot... including how to understand that manual!). The twistable LCD screen is so useful when photographing difficult angles and for self-portraits!I'm no expert but I'm really happy with this purchase                    I waited for several years to invest in a DSLR and now I'm glad I did. The Canon T3i is everything I want in a camera. It's extremely easy to change lenses. With my previous SLR cameras it was often a fight to get the lens out so I could use a different one.The pictures are extremely bright and clear. I love being able to use the automatic mode and them switch to manual. Both are useful for different photographic situations. I tend to prefer automatic when there's lots of action, and I don't have time to decide how to change the settings.The camera feels good in your hand. Even with the heavier lenses, it isn't difficult to hold. The IS (Iso Stabilization) feature is a blessing. I have ruined countless shots with camera shake. Thus far, I've only had one failure and that was when I tried a close up at a very long distance.I recommend this camera highly. It does everything I want it to do. The lenses are easy to install and give have good zoom features. I will keep using the camera and see whether I still love it next year, but I suspect I will still be a fan.                    I am still learning a lot about my camera, and I have a long way to go to learn everything possible. But for being my first semi-pro camera it is absolutely wonderful! Very easy to use for a newbie (me) and it takes such beautiful pictures!                    This is my second of this model. I had to do a wedding and the second camera was needed. I was very happy with the first one and this doubles my pleasure. For the money it is as good as it gets. The tilting screen is great!                    The Canon EOS Rebel T3i is a fantastic camera.  It is my first move into the world of "real" cameras.  The instruction manual was a bit intimidating at first when one views all the possible functions for the camera.  However, it ends up being relatively simple.  Certainly it is easy to point, autofocus and shoot.  The results are crystal clear and far superior to any camera I've previously owned.  I highly recommend it.                    As the title says, I hate taking it out of the bag because every time I handle it I want to buy a new accessory for it.It's an amazing camera for an intermediate photographer. Tons of customization and different settings. It's got great photo quality and awesome image stabilization and auto focus. It's an amazing consumer grade DSLR with plenty of ulgradeability to take it even as far as the pro level in time. I highly recommend this camera.                    I use the T3i to shoot narrative concert videos on location. The camera gives me several advantages: 1. Flip out LCD makes it easy to compose a shot from all kinds of angles; 2. Audio levels on cam tell me if I'm peaking when recording voice only; 3. Compact size makes it easy to mount on a small rack, then handhold and shoot, then stabilize in CS6. Final product looks like Steadicam work. Also, this cam is very reliable in all sorts of temperatures. Haven't had a single problem with it so far and I don't expect any. I owned the T2i prior to my purchase of the T3i so I knew what I was getting image wise. I would never record music audio direct to camera--I use double-system sound (AKG 220's and R16) and sync with PluralEyes in post. However, with a Rode VideoPro mic, it's fine to record voice only audio straight into camera (no JuicedLink or Beachtek). I counter the AGC argument by running all audio through Adobe's Soundbooth or Audition and strip out hiss, noise, etc. It's amazing how accurate those programs are in cleaning up audio. If you'd like to see the T2i in action, visit[...]. I'll be adding T3i footage soon.                    I went from a Canon EOS 30D to the Canon Rebel T3i. I am by no means a camera expert, just a hobbyist. I cannot say how amazing this camera is. Such amazing detail and functionality. It will make you think you are an expert. I will update after a few months but for now, I am in love!9 DAY UPDATE- Still really like this camera. I have noticed that it doesn't want to focus very well in low light sometimes, may be the kit lens I am using or I may not be using the correct setting. Overall very nice camera and fast.                    Having had a film EOS years ago I awaited my EOS digital with great expectation. It has not disappointed - from fully auto to creative use it is simply stunning. Shots taken with other cameras simply pale into insignificance. I can hardly wait to experiment further with what is a truly amazing piece of kit,
!###I am a newbie to DSLR cameras. A friend of mine had a Nikon and I was so sure that's what I wanted but couldn't quite swing the price for the one I wanted. She told me her sister had gone with this one and that she loved it. I went ahead and took the plunge and couldn't be happier. This camera is easy very easy to understand for beginners. The menus are clear and you have on screen help if you need it. Would recommend to other newbies....                    The Cannon T3I is an overall great camera. Some of the features are:-Quality of 1080 pixels (HD)-Manual Focus-Regular sized mount for tripod-Also a great compact cameraI have used this camera for a while now and I love it. It has great durability and great battery life. It's been dropped a couple of times and still doesn't even have a scratch. The grip is great. You can get it pretty steady without the use of a stabilizer or tripod. Some of the negative things are that sometimes it stops recording automatically. I still don't know if there is a setting to fix it but if there is, then this is one less negative about this camera. Another one is the lack of distance of the zoom, but this is easily fixed with purchasing a long lense. So I would rate this camera 10/10 because of the great quality and settings for the type of shot you want, also because of the very minimum negatives. This camera is great for people who are looking for a professional grade camera for under one thousand dollars.                    I was using a Canon Rebel XS for about two years, already got my  Canon 28-135 mm lense, a Canon 85 mm 1.8 lense and a Tamron 70-300 mm lense, and then my dad gave this camera as a gift!. It is amazing!!. I noticed the diference right away, my pictures came out way more sharp  and with beautiful vivid colors, what can i say, it is awesome. Now i feel that my lenses are working in their full capacity. I am not a professional photographer, i have been on this only for two years, and i have a long way of things to learn, and this T3I neither is a professional camera, but if your budget don't let you go for a 60D or 5D Mark or L series lenses, i totally recommend you this camera and any of the lenses i mentioned before. It is a very good and affordable option. I have my own backdrops, a flash, and i do a lot "improvised studio sessions" and a lot of outside family and children sessions, and so far i have nothing to complaint about my "baby" T3I. As long as you shoot in manual and know how to play with light, composition and be willing to learn and do your best, you will have great results with this camera. Hope this review help somebody. Im not too much into tech stuff, so this is more about how good this T3I have been for me. Good luck!                    This is my First DSLR camera; but i found it very easy to use. the Quality of the camera is excellent it is not made from a cheap plastic material. i really like the camera.                    Canon T3i is pretty affordable and for the entry level of DSLR camera, it is very good in term of the picture quality.  It is compact and lighter compares to others.  I do not regret to have it.                    I got this camera for much cheaper I paid $578.00 on different website, the trade off is it took about a week and a half to receive it. The camera itself is a great camera you can't go wrong with it. Picture quality is great!                    I love this camera! I really feel for the price it is the best you can get. Camera came quickly and with no issues.                    I sold my Rebel XSi to upgrade to this model. I was attracted by the improved light sensitivity and video functionality.The XSi was always too slow and resulted in a lot of blurry or grainy pictures if the lighting wasn't just right.But the T3i has overcome all of these shortcomings. I love this model and constantly have friends asking me about the camera that took the photos I share with them. A couple of them have gone out and purchased the same one after being so impressed with the quality. Two thumbs up.                    love the articulating lcd.  been waiting to buy a DSLR with this feature.  missed the 60D special pricing.  I have other Canon PowerShots with it.excellent Japanese build quality.  most companies have lowered their quality so low I usually have serious issues, but not with Canon yet (cross my fingers).got it for a really low price, so super happy.would be great if it was full frame, but then it would cost 5 times more.
!###The Canon Rebel T3i was a great purchase. It not only shoots great pictures but also takes some nice video for a DSLR. The camera is great for all "skill" levels of the photographer. Simple to use but also comes with many in depth functions.                    As an indie filmmaker I find the Rebel T3i to be just right for my need. When it comes to cameras yes of course they're several of them that can out perform T3i but people need to remember that you shouldn't allow technology limit your imaginations. For that I found T3i perfect to express my imaginations                    I am a Noob in photography, only been taking pictures for last 3 years.  But this camera serves me well.The only thing I don't like about the XTi, XSi, T1i, T2i, T3i is the body is too small to get a good grip, mind you have small asian hand.  So I bought a battery grip, hope that will help.  For other things, it scores perfect in every criteria.                    I bought this camera about six months ago and I love it. Take the cons with a grain of salt considering this camera's pricePros:-Articulating screen makes shooting at odd angles easier- Relatively inexpensive price for a good selection of features-Video quality is great (if you really want good video go with the T4I instead)-Good button layoutCons:-This camera isn't meant for fast-moving subjects because it shoots a low amount of frames per second.-Picture starts to get grainy around ISO 800, noticeably grainy at 1600 and unusable above that amount even with heavy editing.-No audio jack, which makes it hard to monitor audio levels without external equipment. Very few cameras have an audio jack and are high-end models.Overall, this is an excellent camera and is a good first DSLR. I plan to upgrade to a 7D or 5D mark iii once I have the money.                    I purchased this as both an upgrade for stills and to compliment my Canon HF G10 for video.  I'll start by saying that it's a great still camera - no surprises really.  It's as good as the other entry level Canon's.  The "creative" features are a little silly if you ask me, but easily ignored.Video:  The quality (using my 85mm 1.8) truly is outstanding.  Go watch some semi-pro stuff on Vimeo - this camera can hang with most stuff there.  Manual focusing is a real trick - and on that alone, I would not recommend this as a video camera for the casual videographer.  I wish there were some settings between Auto and Manual (like aperture priority, shutter priority, etc).  Full manual is simply too much work for many situations, and the full auto leaves something to be desired.  I also wish they had put more energy into the audio.  You cannot monitor the audio while recording (with either headphones or even audio levels).  A level is visible while setting the record level, but not while recording.  This oversight really puts a damper on the camera for me, and I have a hard time believing that it would really have increased the cost too much to simply add a headphone jack.I use the Rode VMP, and have had some difficulty getting the audio just right.  The onboard mic is garbage.  I have not gotten around to trying my other mics (lapel, wireless).  Get ready to spend a lot of time getting the settings just right.Still, my overall opinion of the camera is good.  I intend to use it to compliment the G10 (a terrific all around video camera).  The T3i does static shots very well (think: interviews).  The depth of field available is amazing and it performs well for artistic shots (just be prepared to spend time learning how to follow focus).  As to general video shooting and anything handheld, I'll stick to my G10.UPDATE:  I'm quickly becoming spoiled by the quality of the video on the T3i.  I find that I rarely use the G10 anymore.  The quality of the video on this DSLR is really something and I've got the VMP figured out (+20 gain on the mic, and manual audio on the camera set at 8 or 9 clicks above zero).  I also shoot exclusively in 24p.  On the T3i, this is amazing.  I do find that I'm switching back and forth between a 1.4 30mm and the 1.8 85mm a lot (it's way harder to just move back and forth with video than with stills).  Still, it's all about the prime lens with this camera.  I'd recommend at least getting a cheap 1.8 50mm.                    I've had this camera for over 6 months.  I upgraded from the Canon Xsi, and can definitely tell the difference in photo quality between the two cameras.  I am a beginner photographer, so I really don't know much about the technicalities of the camera.  But if you're just going into photography, this would be a good camera.  It's not quite a professional grade camera, but it's a good step up from the cameras below it.  The T3i also has movie mode, and an LCD screen that flips out-I love those features because I did not have them on my previous to dslrs.  I've had to problems so far with the camera.  Very pleased with the performance of the camera so far.                    The reason I decided on the T3i was because of the reviews.  I was not disappointed and thought to write one myself.  I needed a camera for a medical trip I was taking to Port-au-Prince Haiti. I had some narratives that I wanted to capture while working there and knew that a good camera was needed.The purchase was my first quality DSLR camera. As a psychologist I am often amused by the mental/emotional attachment we give to things like tools, PC, and cars...  I feel like I need this dang thing with me all the time, it holds a high level of mental attachment for me.As a first time DSLR user my learning curve was about 3-7 days for functions and creative quality shots. (But that was just to get walking and functioning, I continue to read and learn.) The auto modes of course require very little learning curve travel.On my PC when I zoom in on some of the shots I took I am amazed at the depth and resolution. One landscape picture easily becomes 100s with the right software.  One shot I took over some of the Haitian rubble was of a group of teens shouting and waving at me. They were a bit less than ¼ mile away. I waved back. When I blew the shot up, whoops. One of the boys was giving me a particular hand gesture common to most NJ drivers.Today I am off to buy my 11 year old son his own good camera, not a T3i. He has taken some excellent shots with the T3i and has begun to own my camera.Final thoughts:  Canon "L" series optics/lenses make this great camera, exceptional!Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras                    I bought this for astrophotography and was pleasantly impressed by its capabilities.  The built in ISO noise reduction and Long exposure noise reduction make it a great DSLR for astrophotography.  The adjustable screen display is another great feature that prevents me from having to crane my neck to look through the view finder when it is attached to mt telescope.  I have taken pictures of the Sombrero Galaxy, Pinwheel Galaxy, Orion Nebulea, Saturn, Jupiter, venus, and many others.  It also great for regular photography as well.  Over all a great camera!                    This is my 1st SLR.It is an excellent camera.18-135mm lens is pretty good for amateur photographyIt is pretty light in weight.                    This is my first DSLR and I love it! Everything is just fantastic. The only two things I dislike is that you need a remote shutter in order to use the "Bulb" mode, and the kit lens is just ok. But besides that, Its 100% greatness!
!###We've really enjoyed the t3i.  It's perfect for the consumer that wants exceptional photos.  We wanted something that an excellent auto mode for quick shots of our children and this camera does a great job.  If we want to take the time and dial in a manual setting it's easy to do as well.  The one draw back is no continual auto focus in movie mode.  If a subject is moving in and out of the foreground this may not be the right tool for the job.                    this a great dslr for me.. my sister has a canon t2i w/ the same resolution of 18MP.. but as my friends, and other says compared to t2i this is way much better. the resolution is clear and crisp it exctly captures the real color and moments as if you seen it as it exactly happens right before your own eyes.. plus it easy to use bec. of the text help on screen when you changes the focus and type of shots you wanted im not a prof. photographer im just a traveler who loves to take pics anywhere i go. plus the swivel screen is very nice addition to it too. when your not using it you can turn it the other way around & it wont get any scrathches. also its very easy to understand for a person who only knows how to use a digicam. without even reading the manual you can easily grasp its use and functions. for me its the best dslr in its aspects of the shots resolution and its mobility not to heavy or bulky to bring for a frequent traveler who loves to capture every moments.                    I've had this camera now for about a year. I have never once regretted my purchase. Even when I see people with 7D's and 5DMKII's, I am still thoroughly happy with this camera. I even wrote some articles on my blog about it.Why I like it:1 - light-weight... yes, most pros will decry the plastic body, but for me, I've begun to see this as a plus. The camera is a lot lighter than the Canon metal bodied cameras, and has survived a couple nasty falls with no damage. I try to shoot with a tripod as much as possible, but most of the time, I just don't have time to mess with a tripod - the lighter weight helps.2 - Specs are more than just "good enough"... the specs, when lined up with the 7D are still quite impressive. The only real trade-offs are slightly slower bursts, and a few less focus points. Sensor sizes are nearly identical, and they share the same processor - leading me to believe the t3i's slightly lowered specs are artificial software limits.3 - It's versatile... it does great for both video and stills, even boasting a few better features not found on the 7D (or even 5DMKII for that matter). Also, if you are bold enough to try the Magic Lantern firmware add-on you really get your money's worth - especially for video.                    Great for the beginner like my wife who sets it on full auto and takes great pictures of our gymnast and great for the intermediate like me who prefers many of the great manual functions for added effects and picture quality.                    This camera just does so many things and so easy. I find something new each time I use it. I took 166 images of a youth basketball game. Every shot was in focus. Scenery shots are great.                    I was going to purchase this camera on base due to no taxes.  However, the price that Amazon has is $100 cheaper than on base.  The camera is awesome and takes great pictures.  I haven't got to use the video function too much yet but can't wait to start using it. :)                    This camera has pretty much gone above and beyond my expectations. Very easy to use, lightweight, portable, and great image quality. The articulated screen is both useful and very clear. The only major downsides for me is the small grip, and lack of a dedicated AF assist lamp. But these are pretty minimal for  how great it is (and that it's not a pro level camera).The lens is good all around for a starting kit lens, and has served me well, but you might be better off investing in a quality lens right off the bat, as these will stick with you longer than a camera body (something like a 17-50 or 55 f/2.8 as a walk around). Also, the zoom is loose, so the lens extends by itself when angled downwards.I would recommend reading over in-depth reviews though if you are serious about buying a DSLR as short reviews like this probably won't do them justice.                    This is an amazing camera. In comparison to the T1i I was just using before, the T3i has much better resolution and performs amazingly well in low light.  It has inspired me to take a course once I'm done working in an outlying area of beautiful Alaska!                    Overall this is an outstanding DSLR camera.  I had compared this to the Nikon D5100 and am really glad this one won out.  Even with the kit lens the picture quality is outstanding, and the menu functions are very easy to use.  The menu/navigation on the Canon is far easier to use than is the Nikon, and I found the picture quality to be superior on the Canon as well.This camera was my first jump from the mirrorless to the DSLR world and I am definately not disappointed.  The kit lens is good (I got the 18-55mm), although I have been lens shopping and the kit lens is just part of my case now.  However, it still gets used almost as frequently as any other.The IS system is great, and eliminates a need for a tripod for mid shutter speeds.  I have some steady hands so I can go lower than most, but friends have used the camera and gotten some really sharp shots at slow speeds that would be impossible with older cameras.Overall an outstanding buy and a camera that will, thanks to the EOS lens system, grow with you.  I am not noticing any differences between my pictures and those taken with the 'mid-level' cameras that are twice the price.  Buy and you won't be disappointed.                    CANON REBEL T3i is amazing, its pictures are great and seems to be taken by professionals even if you are a normal user. Auto focus and image stabilizer makes the shooting easier. It has many modes and built in filters. I highly recommend this camera.
!###This is a great camera. I had an XS for 4 years and while I love that camera my abilities out grew the functions of the XS. The t3i was the perfect upgrade for me as it has some fun new features to play around with but it is still something that I am used to and can take wonderful pictures with. I had thought about going for broke and upgrading to the 60D or possibly waiting for the t4i, but decided against it as the t3i and 60D are, in comparison, pretty much the same. And I did not want to pay more for the t4i and have to wait for it when I could get a decently priced t3i right at the very moment that I wanted it. I am not a videographer by any means, I love playing around with the video feature but it is not that important to me. If the video is more important than check out the t4i or the 60D                    I love  this  camera and Canon products in general, however  it has some issues. The issues did not happen straight away. On the second day of shooting  is when the trouble started.  I make no claim to be a professional photographer, this review is an opinion of a photo hobbyist. So after shooting around a 180 pictures mostly with the view finder the camera went dead no power to the unit. I also had an error code display, I can't  say  for sure  that I could see the entire code, but the camera stopped working. When this happened I removed the battery, and placed it back in the camera, and then the camera powered on. It  performed flawlessly for about 20 or more shots. The shots I took looked amazing but I also had some bad shots. I will take credit for the bad shots  it was not the fault of the camera. When I was finished shooting,  I removed the camera battery and placed it in the charger. The very next day I went for a photo shoot. I shoot mostly view finder,I shot about 200 photos this time. When I was finished shooting  I turned the camera off. Sometime later I went to use the camera  again, I turned the camera on, and no responded. I removed the battery, and charged it, when it was fully charged I placed the battery in the camera and  it worked just fine. I have not used the camera since. I'm concerned with the camera , I bought the camera to use on a family vacation. I don't want to have my camera fail on my vacation, so the following morning I called Amazon Customer Service. I explain my situation with the camera. Amazon is sending me a new camera, expedited shipping it will be here on Wednesday. I will rate this camera with 4 stars.  I will subtract one star for being  unreliable, I really love this camera , and hope the next one will be problem free. I could have just received a lemon I understand  that. Would I recommend this camera to someone else despite its shortcomings.  The answer is yes, however  my tune my change if  I receive another unit with the same issues. Well if that happens I will cut my loses and get a refund sad to say. I owned many Canon cameras both film, and digital and all of those examples performed flawlessly. Until then I will wait with anticipation  for the  new unit to arrive. I rate 5 stars to Amazons customer service they always shine in my eyes. More to follow and, hopefully the next review will be great.Sincerely Robert                    This is my first DSLR and I couldn't be happier with it. I bought the body only, then got a Canon 28-105 lens seperately. I recently purchased a 50mm f/1.8 lens as well.The camera is very easy to learn how to use. I watched some videos on youtube and skimmed the manual online while I was waiting for it to come in the mail (I ordered it from a different site around New Year's, so I had about a week and a half wait from when I ordered it) and as soon as I got it, charged the battery and started using it. Before this, I was using my video camera or old point and shoot for stills, but I have used a couple of other people's DSLRs (on auto mode). I've been using this exclusively in manual mode so far and it took a little bit the first day to get used to picking the right exposure settings, but once I got used to it, it's not bad. This camera takes really great photos.Other good things are: compared to my Canon Vixia HF200 (video camera), the battery seems to last a comparable length with video and the recording rate is somewhere around 5.5 mb/s with the T3i, where it goes up to 24mb/s (I believe) on the HF200, so the videos don't take up as much room on the memory card or my computer, but they look better because of the lenses and, I assume, the proccessing. The audio is surprisingly good too. I shoot videos at shows occasionaly(**Youtube search username chunkvideos and look at the Pianos Become The Teeth videos for the best example**), I manually adjusted the audio level to the lowest possible level (it indicated clipping otherwise) and the video actually sounds really good. That being said, when you're not in a loud environment, the internal mic picks up all of the camera and handling noises, so the fact that it has a mic input jack will come in handy in getting better audio.The autofocus works good sometimes. I'm trying to mostly use manual focus unless I'm taking a photo of my puppy running around the yard or something with similar action (which is also hard to autofocus on, btw). I used autofocus the first few days and it wouldn't always focus where I wanted it to (it'd focus on my puppy's nose or toys instead of her eyes, etc). I know there is a way to select focus points, but I'd rather just do it manually, plus it doesn't have full time autofocus while shooting video. Autofocusing on video does not look or sound good with this camera.I haven't used the vari-angle screen as much as I thought I would yet, but even without using it for different angles, it's pretty convenient. I like that I can store it with the screen facing towards the camera body, so it's protected. I also like that when I have it flipped out to the side, my nose isn't against the screen and there is a little extra room for my face when I'm looking through the viewfinder. I have tried "self portraits" with it (in quotes because half of them were just me pointing the camera at my face), but it's hard to do without a tripod because neither of my lenses will focus closer than 18". It's kind of hard with a tripod too, because of focusing before you get to where you're going to stand (again, autofocus wouldn't focus on my face).Continuous shooting and exposure bracketing are really nice features. I also like that you can do both with a timer. Exposure bracketing is something that I overlooked when I was researching camera options, because I didn't know what it was. You can quickly and easily set your camera to take 3 continuous photos with the same aperature, but at different shutter speeds, so it produces an under exposed, normally exposed, and over exposed version of the same shot (assuming you use a tripod or hold the camera really still) and if you use software that can merge the three images into one, you can create an image that shows details in the dark, light, and medium areas of the photo. For instance, in a normal photo of a sunset, the sun would be bright and anything like trees or buildings in the foreground would be dark, merging would allow you to see details in the foreground too.Pros:-Photo quality-Manual settings-Ease of use-Manual focus-Low noise-Good low light shots-1080p video with good quality-Manual settings for video-Vari-angle screen-Mic input jack-Manual audio levels-Small file sizes for HD video-Not too big or heavy-The flash doesn't pop up in manual mode (it hasn't for me anyway)-It actually comes with usable software (I've been doing all of my photo editing with the included software, I think it's called Digital Photo Professional)-It can store camera and lens setting information on your photos (not literally on them, but in the file information)-Continuous shooting works nicely-Exposure bracketing is a cool feature which allows you to edit high dynamic range photos-Able to use a timer and choose how many shots you want the camera to take and if you want it to be exposure bracketed or notCons:-Autofocus hasn't worked well for me-Cropped sensor makes it hard to get wide angle shots without spending a lot on a nice lensUpdate: I've gotten some better lenses since writing this review and the autofocus issue seems to have had to do with the lenses and not the camera.                    I have been a Canon EOS user for about 15 years, starting out with manual cameras and then working my way up to the EOS digital models in 2005.Two years ago, I was getting a little frustrated carrying around a bag with multiple lenses and the camera on holidays. I wanted something small that had similar capabilities. I found it in the Panasonic Lumix range and sold all of my Canon gear.Then my daughter was born. Suddenly my major focus changed from landscape shots to portraits and Kodak moment type snaps of her. This was fine when we were outdoors but compact cameras really struggle in low-light situations. Two months ago, I decided it was time to dive back into the world of digital SLRs. I didn't need too many bells and whistles, just a simple SLR that could take fantastic shots of my daughter and her future siblings.I found it.This EOS is a super camera for the price. I used to pay 4 times as much to get lesser quality in the older cameras in the range. My brother, a professional photographer, has one of the best models in the series and even he is impressed with this basic model's capabilities.The new articulated screen is a good addition as is the ability to take HD video. The camera fills my hand nicely and is easy to hold stable due to the molded back. Th e software, screen menus,and buttons are all familiar and easy to understand. Anyone with previous Canon experience will feel right at home.The best part of all, though, is that I am now producing beautiful photos of my daughter with no effort whatsoever.I would recommend this camera to any new user to digital SLRs or users who want to come back to something bigger than a compact without going overboard.                    I upgraded from the T2i, and i am so happy that i did! The swivel lcd screen is so cool. Im already experimenting with different angle shots, i just could not get with a non swivel lcd. I didnt know how much i would love just that one feature, but i really do. The audio controls is also really awes! The zoom feature while in movie mode is nice too. Because im only shooting with a 50mm prime right now, being able to zoom in makes it really nice. Sure its only a digital zoom, but with good lenses, not zoomed to full capacity, it should work well. Even at 3x, that turns my lens into a 150mm, sort of. haha. Overall i love this cam, and if someone is thinking about upgrading from the t2i, do it! you wont regret it. FYI. Become an Amazon Prime member, or do the free trial. I got this shipped over night for only $4 bucks! haha. I hate waiting a week for stuff like this to arrive.                    After searching and searching for a DSLR camera I had almost convinced myself of the T2i. I resisted and ended up waiting to purchase the T3i, which was the best decision I made. At a glance the camera has a good feel to it and overall has the same features as the T2i. The main differences I noticed in it were the flip out LCD screen, which I use more often for some of the photos I take. Among the screen, the improvement to the video truly being 1080p and the simple menu. The camera itself is very user friendly whether you have read the manual or not. I am a person to read through and learn the various features the camera has to offer. I am impressed with the lens that comes with the camera for the wide angle aspect of it due to a lot of places I shoot pictures there are a lot of people and requires me to get close to get the shot I want. Disappointed they offer HDMI input, but don't provided the cable. I have only scratched the surface of my purchase, but I am pleased thus far. I recommend anyone looking for a camera to at least give the T3I a glance or consider it.                    Great camera, i bought just the frame for my wife, and paired it with a sigma 18-250 IS lens.  Its easy to use, and creates great pictures when used properly.  We use the highest settings and can blow pictures up to 20"                    I bought this camera in May from my local camera store and I couldn't be happier with my choice. I researched for months and I really wanted a Nikon but at the time there weren't any new Nikons out and the newest DSLR in my price range was the T3i. I talked to every one I knew with a DSLR and they all said it was a great camera. So I decided to give it a shot.I love this camera. I only used Auto for the first few months while I learned what all the buttons did (I prob still dont know them all). Now I almost never shoot in auto unless I cant get the picture I want then I try auto.Pros:Great screenthe screen rotateseasy to use buttonsthe pictures turn out amazinggreat battery lifeCons:Price, Im cheap and I know it. I hate how expensive the lens and camera was.Over all it was worth every penny I spent. I love how wonderful the pictures come out and all the wonderful functions. I suggest everyone taking a photography class when they buy a DSLR. You need to learn all you can about these amazing camera DONT ONLY SHOOT AUTO!                    I am an entry-level DSLR owner, and wanted a camera that would grow with me. The T3i is absolutely perfect for this.I don't actually care about the video-taking capabilities of this camera, though when I have taken video with it, it's been fine. What I really care about is how well it takes pictures, and for that, it's fantastic. The full-on automatic setting is great, sometimes taking a much better picture than I would have. The "no-flash automatic" is what I tend to use most, especially in indoor areas like museums. When I want to play with DOF, the Aperture Priority setting is excellent.This camera performs admirably in low-light settings, often getting shots without a flash that shock me with their quality. In Lightroom, I don't have to do much postprocessing to get my shots to come out looking great. My only complaint is that the automatic setting does tend to overexposure, so if you're in a situation where the lighting isn't standard, keep an eye on that and switch to a more manual setting. It's a lot harder to fix overexposure than underexposure.If I have any complaint about this camera, it's that I would have liked more, or better, indicators via the viewfinder. I find I use the viewfinder -- which is not, by the way, the brightest or sharpest viewfinder I have ever seen -- more than the LCD monitor by far -- to the point where I sometimes don't flip the LCD monitor over at all. And about the flipping -- that's a very nice touch. I don't often use it like one would use a side-view mirror, but I do love that flipping it over protects the screen.Likely, if you're an enthusiast who can afford this camera, you're not going to use the postprocessing techniques in the "Creative mode" section of the camera; you'll use an outside tool like Lightroom. I wouldn't put much stock in being able to, for example, apply a magenta tone to your picture. And labelling on-phone is a giant pain. Unless you think you'll forget the location, don't even bother.The kit lens on this camera is actually quite good - I alternate between the kit lens and the f/1.8 50mm that everyone who owns a Canon DSLR should have. Unless you're wanting to take significant zoom images, it's a clear, fast lens for most work.For what I wanted this camera to do, I have found it to be absolutely fantastic.                    I've been using Canon auto focus cameras for over 20 years and have been wanting a second camera body. I absolutely love the 6400 ISO on this camera. It makes for very nice and natural looking indoor photographs at gatherings.It uses a newer battery configuration than my older camera, and I think that was a poor decision on the part of the manufacturer as I cannot use some of my only slightly older accessories and need to carry around two sets of those accessories. Also had to purchase a new battery grip.I got it about 10 days ago and took a few hundred pix at a family wedding that did not have a pro-photog. It was a breeze to use, but like earlier models in the series.
!###I purchased this product for my wife.  She has purchased other models of the same mark, but this one takes the prize.  Great camera!!!                    The camera works very well.  Purchased body only and it arrived in perfect condition. It is a little heavier than my old Cannon.                    This is my first DSLR; still playing with all it's modes.I find the time between pictures to be very short unlike my previous point and shoot. Would have loved if the package contained an SD card though.Yet to find issues if any with it.                    I bought this camera as an upgrade to my Canon Rebel xsi and it is every bit as amazing as I thought it would be. I use it primarily for product shots so I need excellent quality in a photograph and this camera provides that quality. my shots are everything I need them to be. I find it easy to operate as well. Combined with a Canon Macro lens I purchased I'm all set. This photo is proof of the quality of this camera. Janice[...]                    This is my first digital slr camera and must say it is amazing right out of the box. I found the camera easy to operate, well the basics, without reading the manual. The clarity of the pictures are superb. There is one little thing that I would have to say needs improvement and that would be the flash. After a few pictures using the flash, the flash would take a few seconds, maybe a minute to reload. The camera will show you that the flash is busy. But besides that, everything is exceeds my expectations. It's a great camera especially for the price. Oh, by the way, the video is excellent. It's very easy to switch between camera and video mode. LOVE IT!!!                    I consider my self a techie, but have not ventured into the world of DSLR's until recently when I purchased the Canon T3i.  The camera is easy to use straight out of the box, or you can spend days learning all of the options and abilities of this camera.  It takes decent video, but it takes some time to get use to the clunky video controls.  The different scene options help for us who are just starting out, and the automatic setting is great for those who don't want to learn about the camera's manual side.  Overall great first DSLR.  I got it with the 18-55mm kit lens, but would definitely recommend spending the extra money and getting the 18-135mm lens.  I can see now the great flexibility that a lens with that range would give.                    Canon has once again answered the call. This camera has everything you need for most still shooting, and full HD video, at a very affordable price! Like many of the reviewers before me, the kit lens leaves a bit to be desired. It looks good, reacts well, great glass,...but is built cheaper and lighter than the standard lens lineup and feels a bit "break easy" for use every day. At this pricepoint, however,(I got mine during cyber week) there is flexibility to invest in a better lens. And with casual use the kit lens should last a good while. I'll update if I'm wrong about that!!The vari-angle monitor is very handy and has a crystal clear screen. If your used to Canon this is will familiar ground for you as most controls, and shooting modes, are right where they are supposed to be. Good, fast, AF. Live view. 18mp! In my opinion, definitely the biggest bang for buck out there right now!!!I would suggest reading the hands-on reviews. You'll be impressed.                    The other reviews speak for themselves.......Great Starter DSLR Camera and could have paid over $200 more for the exact same thing at Bust Buy.                    The camera is fantastic. It is everything that was expected and more. If you're looking for some good shootin' then I say take the dive into this wonderland. Pics were taken that were unexptected to be so well done. One caveat, my hands are a little big for the frame.. still five stars, though.                    I bought this camera when it was $850 and I think it's a steal now with this new price. So the camera has 80% of the things that its bigger brothers have: a gorgeous LCD screen, same processor as other crop sensor cameras, 1080p video recording, wirelessly controlling flashes. It's also lightweight and compact. The kit lens is great, too. Of course you can't compare it to an L-lens, but I think for just $110, it has an unbeatable value/price. I'm now thinking to upgrade to 5d Mark III once it's available and this was my first DSLR, but I can honestly say that it served me very well while I was an amateur. For those of you who are interested in the camera, I strongly recommend buying the 430 Ex II flash as well.Pros:Price1080p videoCompact and lightweightGreat lens for priceCons:Focus points are not as good as the expensive models(which is justified by the price)ISO is usable only until 800
!###The camera takes great pictures, but using it as a video camera is not always ideal (no stabilizing features).  It's like filming with a video camera from the 80's, but you don't buy a camera like this for the video, you buy it for the pictures.  The pictures are incredible and I'm still learning all the features that it offers.  The quality is great (what you would expect from a Canon).  I'm giving it a 5 star review for the pictures.  If your buying it for the video I'd give it a 3.                    Great camera for the money.  Bought it for my wife as smaller Canon SLR forease of use and packing, etc.  Nice accompanying camera to our 5D Mark II.                    Very intuitive and produces stunning images. The only gripe I have is the video functionality. There is no autofocus on video which is a big hole in its capability                    I have an old Canon Rebel bought  in 2007 which has 8 MP - pretty impressive 4 years ago, but this 18 MP is amazing!  The clarity is so sharp and it is FAST!  I use my camera for portrait and sports photography & I couldn't be happier.  Since it was in the Rebel family, I did not have to go to the expense of also buying new lenses.  The old ones snapped right on & I was good to go.  I have been looking for a new camera for several months, researching features and prices.  The Rebel T3i had all the right features & as always, Amazon had the best price!  The camera is easy to use, controls are placed perfectly and the big 3 inch screen means you don't have to squint to see the menu or your photos.  I wasn't really interested in the video aspect of this camera, but I have tried it & I am very happy with it as well.  If you are looking for a new camera that an amateur can use to get professional looking portraits or a professional can use with enough creative control to get some great shots then this is the camera to buy!                    I purchased this camera a couple of weeks ago and let me tell you.  This camera is awesome!It's made me really excited about those upcoming vacations :)UPDATE:  It's now been a couple months since I've had this camera and I'm still loving it!I have been experimenting with it and purchased several different lenses (sigma 18-250, Canon 60mm macro, canon 50mm f1.8.)  I recently took some beautiful sunset pictures which i added to the product images.I hope you will enjoy this camera as much as I am.                    This is my first dslr after using lots of different point & shoot from canon & nikons. I am very much happy with how much I can control different aspects of the photo. Well I am still learning so can't say much about anything else. I have small hands and this fits perfectly into it.                    I stepped up to this DSLR to gain high resolution and greater flexibility in photos.  I still have much to learn but so far it is really easy to take great high resolution photos on the basic automatic setting that are available.                    I've had the camera for approximately 1 month and its great thus far. Pictures are absolutely fantastic and it takes pictures fast. I have a 20 month old and there are moments when I want to capture it but with point and shoot cameras it was a hassle. By the time it starts up the moment is gone. With the T3i I flick the switch to on push the button and snap the picture is taken. I am still learning all the features of the camera so if you are new to the SLR game, as I am, there will be plenty to keep you busy. I have shot a few quick movies with it and the playback is great as well as the quality of the HD recording.If you are looking for a huge step above a point and shoot digital camera then this is your camera. Its more bulky when compared to a point and shoot but for the quality of pictures it takes its well worth the added weight.                    Decided it was time to upgrade from the original Canon Digital Rebel - the 6.3MP version.  The new 18MP machine comes with image stabilizer lens, is more compact but still comfortable to hold, takes all the Canon image-stabilizing (or non-IS) lenses, and the flip-out screen can be turned to suit your position for live viewing.  Bunches of options for maximal control; this camera has matured nicely -- It is a work of art!                    OK there are tons of reviews of this camera, so I'll keep it brief.Excellent photo quality!  Controls... are OK, not as good as the 60D series, but it's cheaper.I do not like the fact that unlike my old t1i, the screen doesn't go off when you get your eye up to the viewfinder.  The focus is slow and not so good when using the tilt screen in video mode.  Despite those shortcomings I still like the camera and the low light capability, both photos and videos is amazing.
!###I did a little bit of research before buying this camera... This is my first DSLR and still learning to utilize its all features.... I went for this combination (camera and lens) because I am just an amateur photographer and don't want to swivel around lenses when i want to take pictures.. With this range (18-135) well, you can capture most of the things you want to capture, far and near..  I am pretty much satisfied with it.. but in the near future, i might as well get a 75-300mm lens.. ( I see pictures of moon taken by my friends with high range telephoto zoom lens and get jealous ! ). There are a few issues like the  video does not have auto focus and in the low light, AF takes time...In short, I am happy with my investment.                    I love this camera. This is my second camera from Canon and I am never let down with the quality of items. The image quality was outstanding. The battery life was long even when shooting in live mode or recording video. One thing i did notice was that the video file size was rather large even when not shooting in 1080p. That was the only real dissatisfaction I had with this camera. One of my favorite features is the flip out screen. You never realize how much you utilize it till you have the option. The ISO range is fantastic and makes it easy to shoot in low light without using flash. The menu is user friendly, as always, and the settings are all easy to use. I am extremely happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone, pro or beginner                    so far so good... I will be taking this cam to OSH 2011 to shoot aircraft... I use it daily at KHNB to shoot aircraft...I did a complete review of available camera's on the market in the middle of June in 2011 and the T3i came in tops for these tax dollars to be spent on something that will be around for a long time!!                    QUICK SUMMARY:  Be sure to format the SD card before using your new camera!  I mysteriously lost one day's photos after a two-week vacation, and I suspect the issue may be with not formatting the SD card beforehand.BACKGROUND:  I bought this camera (my first DSLR) before taking a once-in-a-lifetime tour of several national parks in the western U.S.  I got the camera on a Saturday and by Tuesday I was on a flight to Las Vegas.  I took fewer than a dozen photos before leaving on vacation, so I mostly used the fully automatic setting for all my shots.  I've owned Canon point-n-shoot cameras for many years, so I simply opted to go with a make I already knew something about.  That, and the hugely favorable user reviews here on Amazon made this an easy choice.WHAT I LIKED:- With virtually no preparation at all, I began taking great photos of the national parks we visited.  The colors and intentional blurring of the background scene help the photos look terrific.- The camera was surprisingly (to me) light in weight; however, after having it strapped around my neck for hours and hours, it did feel a little heavy.- If you are used to using Canon point-n-shoot cameras, this DSLR uses the same kinds of icons and abbreviations on the menu switch.  It's very intuitive for Canon users.ONE LITTLE PROBLEM:I bought a book on how to use this camera (Canon EOS Rebel T3i / 600D: From Snapshots to Great Shots, but I didn't read it until AFTER I was flying home on the last day of our two-week vacation.  In the book, I read this (about formatting the memory card):  "When you purchase any new SD card, you can pop it into your camera and start shooting right away - and probably everything will work as it should.  However, what you *should* do first is format the card in the camera... The card may work in the camera without first being formatted, but chance of failure down the road are much higher."When I (who work in the IT industry) read that, I thought to myself, "Bah!  This guy is wrong.  If it's formatted, it'll work, and if it's not formatted, it won't work."Then I got home last night and began transferring ~1400 photos from the camera to my home server.  And to my astonishment, there is one whole day of my family's vacation that is completely missing from the photos!  It's Day Two, when we toured Hoover Dam.  There isn't one dam photo from Day 2 on the SD card!  I have no idea where the dam photos are or what happened to those dam photos!  Weirdly, the photo sequence from Day 3 began at #130, and the end of Day 1 was #129.  I didn't delete or download any dam photos from Day 2, but they're all gone.  Every dam photo from Day Two - gone!So, tonight, I'm going to format the SD card so if I ever return to Hoover Dam, I won't again lose any dam photos that I take.                    I have never had a single issue with this camera and have just recently expanded out my accessories with a 430EX II flash and a Custom Brackets folding flash mount. I've used the stock 18-55 and 55-250 kit lenses since I purchased brand new and have taken some awesome pictures. I plan on expanding soon to some better lenses as I learn more but so far this cropped sensor body has been great. I've even done a few video projects with it that have come out looking great. If you are looking to buy new right now, you can't go wrong with an older inventory T3i and save a few dollars over the T4i or T5i, as they are all basically the same for general features.                    Wonderful camera. First srl I bought. New to photography and surprised how great pictures look with little experience already. easy to use.                    I'm very new to DSLR and to shooting with anything but auto mode. At first I decided on the Nikon 5100 because I've always like my coolpix, my relatives own Nikon DSLRs (higher end),  and the wonderful reviews online. I ended up returning that one because the LCD goes black when turning it 180 deg. after only a  week of shooting and felt discouraged after reading about Nikon customer service rating online. My friend suggested Canon "easier to learn if you are new to DSLR" she said.Somehow, after playing with the controls and reading the manual that came with this camera, it made me realized why and how people would use manual, Av, Tv, P mode. (I thought it would be too to complicated and cumbersome to do when I had the Nikon). This camera is very intuitive, you can change desired settings without taking your eyes off your subject. I think it will be easy to always remember how to change the main settings.Now I am excited about learning composition,exposure, etc  and improve my picture taking skills.Btw, had a chance to compare the portrait of my daughter I took with the d5100 (P mode) vs the t3i, this kit lens (18-55) seem to be very sharp, with accurate skin tone. I got worried at first because I think I prefer a softer look of skin tone, like her skin with the d5100 ( like it was airbrush, although it seems to have more red tones from d5100, not sure if I like that).  Luckily ,there is a setting I can adjust for a softer look in different degrees on this camera. THIS definitely is a keeper.                    This is a great all-round camera. I particularly bought it for DSLR movies. With it's Hi-definition options, it takes great quality movies, and while it is an entry level camera, I see the results quite impressive and in several setups will give you undistinguished results when compared to the 5d markII. Improvement in low light situations would help in the next model, but it is something you can easily work around. All in all, great value for money.                    i wanted to get a dslr just for general picture taking (family, pets, my shoe collection, etc..) i was thorn between the canon t3i and nikon d5100.. after doing research and reading hundreds of reviews, i went with the canon t3i.. when i first got it, i was really intimidated with all the buttons.. so right now i'm mostly shooting at auto while learning how to manually operate it.. it's smaller and lighter than i expected.. i use the tilt swivel lcd screen a lot, it's really useful when taking pictures at an angle.. i know i still have a lot to learn but so far i'm loving this camera!!i can't review the video because i still don't know how to do it!!PROS:high quality pictures.. the difference between a point and shoot and this camera is very obvious when it comes to quality!!good grip!!swivelling lcd screen!!creative filters!! i love the miniature effect!!great for all around photography!!makes you look like a pro when you walk around with it!!user friendly!!CONS:the price!! i bought the lens kit for 795.. OUCH!! but i don't regret it!!battery life!! battery life is not really that bad, but you might wanna buy an extra battery if you're gonna shoot all day!!                    Out of all gadgets I have, This one tops any I ever purchased. I'm going to try & be quick about reviewing this camera, but I'm very very excited about this one. I personally think canon did an excellent job in designing this. This is my first SLR camera. I'm use to sony products & don't knock there camera's, & I love their camcorders... but to find an all around camera & camcorder... is unusual. First of all this is a very economical good sized, & comfortable great feeling camera.. very powerful HD 1080p video & picture effects. Very easy to use, can use for a point & shoot right out of box. That's not really why I bought it, I bought this after doing a lot of research 6mths prior to buying. Even though I had in mind what I was going to purchase. I did'nt see or read reviews on this until the end of April 2011. So this had'nt been out much longer than that. This seemed right a way everything I was looking for in a slr camera + more. If you don't no how to use this, as soon as you turn it on there is information on lcd screen which ever dial mode you use right there... so for the beginner this is just great. I already have some knowledge of camera's. The dof on this camera is amazing along with other things you can do to manually control what you're looking to achieve in pictures & movies. I have some very professional depth of field shots off this camera. The t3i came out with the flip out LCD screen in which works great when filming or taking pics high or low from eye level. The camera before this one was the t2i, which did not have the flip out screen. This also has good 3x to 10x zoom you have to set up if you choose to go that route, I use this on occassions, so it's good to know you can do this. You do need extra batteries & lenses that will make this such a professional camera. The battery grip is another option that I personally needed & suggest to add more time to battery life, this doubles a single battery use. I feel this camera is best used in as much manual control as possible, the automatic functions are great... but ( OH ) the depth you can get into using manual control is never ending. I've takin some very breathtaking photo's on some half dead flowers outside my house & this camera made these flowers look so professional, I'm blowing up some of these to 19 by 24 photo's & you would have never known this was takin from half dead flowers... we are going to hang these up on our front entrance way to dining area. There is so much to the canon eos t3i, I can't even attempt to tell how much fun I'm having & purchasing more accessories with it... This was a great choice... Highly Recommend... A+A+A+A+.
!###I have had the opportunity to use this camera in low light, bright light and action. It outperforms any other camera I have ever owned and I have a professional Canon D10 that will sit on the shelf from now on. I am extraordinarily happy with the product and the service in getting the camera to me. It arrived quickly and I was able to use it right away.                    Good camera.  I did a lot of research beforehand and asked friends about their experience.  This camera is what I expected so that's a good thing.                    I loved this camera when I got it a few weeks ago (not from amazon, as I got a better bundle price somewhere else - sorry amazon, it does happen on occasion :)I bought it for my daughters wedding (yeah, no pressure there, right?) and it worked until she was about to take her vows and then - stopped working (on auto).  I freaked out (internally not visibly), but let it go and missed the shots :(This camera is touchy and apparently the lens focus can get stuck (it seems to be a common, unaddressed problem with this camera) when it's on auto.  When that happens, it will not work in auto, period.  When that happens, you have to pull on the lens focus ring, until you hear a click and then it will work again.  And also - if it doesn't work on auto, immediately turn it to manual and it will work (most likely, as it did for me and many other people who own this camera).  I found this out half by accident (the manual part, which I figured out halfway through my daughters wedding), and the other half from finding one awesome individual who had posted the fix for this, and left it online for 2 years.  I am posting this on amazon because I do not want this to happen to Anyone else (and I look at amazon reviews and take them into consideration, before I purchase an expensive item, myself, so I would guess other people do too).  Maybe all dslr cameras are touchy, I don't know, this is my first one.  But I wanted to try and make sure no one else missed a pivotal moment, if the camera suddenly stopped working.  I still love the camera, but I can only give it 3 stars due to the info I am passing on here is Not in the instruction manual(and it should be).I contacted canon about this issue and was told they did not have time to address every trouble shooting issue this camera could have.  Even common issues, apparently.  I was very disappointed in their customer service.  And was even told - gee, look at all our great reviews on amazon.  Which makes me wonder how many of the great reviews were written by people working for canon.  And while I give the camera 3 stars, I give the company that makes this camera, zero stars.                    The 600D / T3i is a excellent camera from canon, read below the good and bad things about T3i*********The Good********No noise at base ISO / Usable Images up to ISO 3200vari-angle High res-displayFull HD at selectable frame rates and HD movie @ 60FPSKit Lens image quality is also improved compared to canon old non-IS kit lenses********The Bad**********Camera struggle to do AF when live view is on,I always use viewfinder for shooting my images and live view display is useless to me due to the AF issueNo AF during movie modelot of hot / stuck pixel issue with my 600D/T3i                    This is a great camera for taking pictures.  However, if you are going to be taking video with it, be aware that one huge defect is that it does not have autofocus.  In other words, while you are taking video, you need to manually focus with the lens and this is bothersome.  Most point and shoot cameras have autofocus, so since this was my first SLR, I was disappointed to see the lack of this useful feature.I can not say anything negative of the still pictures this camera takes.  They are great!  But be aware of this deficiency in the video.                    I love Canon! I have had a few cameras before this one including a few 14 megapixel cameras and this by far blew them out of the water. The clarity and the range that this camera gave me was like no other camera that I have had before. There are a few reasons that I would equate this camera with the best on the market but I cannot say it in only one sentence so here it goes; the good first, then the bad.PROS:First of all the QUALITY that you get for your money when it comes to Canon products is by far the best deal that you will get when it comes to excellent camera equipment. I bought an SLR from Nikon a few year back thinking that the saving would come in handy. However I did not expect the camera to have so many problems! Automatic focus would never work correctly, the white balance was always atrocious even after I would fix it continuously. It just seems like anything that could go wrong went wrong with that camera. That is why now I SWEAR BY THE SUPERIOR QUALITY OF CANON. The last 3 cameras I have owned have been Canon and I willnever go back.Enough with Canon, now this specific camera. The 18.0 MP CMOS sensor was definitely a step up for me. You could see the difference in high-fidelity when it came to the HD images. I was blown away by the processor speed as well. You rarely had to wait more than a few seconds in between shots and the DIGIC lived up to its hype among enthusiasts.The ISO which is denoting the realized speed was AWESOME. Not only was it versatile but the bright to dim modifications that you could change in the setting really set this camera apart in my opinion.This thing is FAST! I love it when electronic equipment can work at the same pace as my brain does, when I am taking pictures the last thing I want to think about is waiting on the camera to finish loading. Not with this. Canon got this right, this could also have a lot to do with the new innovative processor.I had been looking to invest in a camera for a long time. I love taking my camera out at the most inopportune moments and taking pictures of things that no one else would see the art behind. I was really inspired by my sister's camera choice a year back. She chose the Canon EOS but it was a different model then the one here.Another thing that I loved about this camera was the SCREEN SIZE! I love a big screen when I take pictures, it helps me put a scene or object into perspective better in my mind. Don't ask me why or how, it just does. By being able to see the picture that I took on such a large screen, I also can see what I need to improve in the picture and what I need to keep the same.Also, keeping with the screen, the menu options were so simple! I am a guy so the last thing I want to do is open up a manual but this thing to into account people of all skill levels!Speaking of pictures! THIS CAMERA TAKES EXTRAORDINARY PICTURES! Was cap locks necessary? Yes it was. Obviously your thinking, umm, yes of course this camera would take good pictures with the price your paying for it. But as I have looked around online this price point isn't too bad in relation to some other sites online.STARTLING VIDEO QUALITY! Ok I love to talk about this feature of the camera because I love the video camera on this camera. First off, a few weeks back there was an interview with the Japanese CEO of Canon asking him why Canon was seemingly breaking into the video industry when they were already the front-runner in quality when it came to still photography. He said that Canon would like to experiment with adding their quality into the video sector of the industry. Now if I was Sony I would be scrambling to get my cards together because if Canon starts breaking into the video industry you can guarantee that Sony is going to lose a lot of capital with their main competitor increasing their inventory capabilities. When asked if Canon would ever give up its still camera quality to pursue video the CEO said without hesitation that there is no way that Canon would ever stop innovating and improving their cameras. That is there roots and what has made them great and they will never give that up. This is good news for all you purists out there that just want to take beautiful pictures and leave the video to Hollywood and family time.CONS:DSLR's are BIG! Yes, I know, you didn't see that coming did you? Well, it's true and it definitely rears its head when you are at a amusement park or on a long trip and you have to haul your camera around everywhere with you. This isn't such a bad thing when you're going somewhere, like a wedding, to specifically take pictures but it can be definitely a hindrance when you're trying to move fast. If this doesn't bother you then more power to you, it bothers me. However, I knew how big this camera was when I got it and I still got it because the PROS DEFINITELY OUTWAY THE CONS IN MY OPINION. Also, if you have children around then I say BE CAREFUL. My kids almost broke this camera a few times which would have been a horrible thing.  Just make sure if you're going to buy this camera that it fits your lifestyle or you can conform that to fit your camera.The battery life is pretty short on this. I love to take a lot of pictures, upload them online and then edit them or delete depending on how good they are. This battery life was a little hard to do that with because you need to prioritize which pictures you want uploaded before the battery shuts off. This may seem like a pretty bad thing to some but once you have a routine down, like I do now, then it generally gets easier to gauge how much battery life you need to do certain things.These two things are probably the biggest things that I would criticize about this camera. This camera is as close to perfect as its going to get, on a budget, in my opinion.Summary:Life is about give and take and I believe this camera takes the least for your money.  I would love to tell you about every single little detail that I love or hate about this camera but I have told you the most important things in my opinion. Feel free to critique anything I said if you don't agree or post questions in the reply if you want more information, I would love to tell you. I have had this for about 4 months now and I will never go back to a point and shoot, this camera is the real deal and I give it a 5 starts easily.Happy buying!!                    I have waited years to get a Digital SLR camera and after tons of research I chose the Canon T3i. My cousin and my buddy took pictures at my Maui Wedding...they both had the Ti & the T2i. The pictures turned out Awesome (it was Maui) you know. They loved their cameras, and I had to get one. I looked all over the internet for months. I finally pulled the trigger from Amazon, and I am very pleased. Great service from Shutterbug, and it arrived regular mail (free shipping) plus no tax! This is simply the best deal out there. I love this camera! Can't believe I waited this long.I have taken about 200 awesome pictures (well a few needed some work due to user error) but it am totally impressed so far. More to follow as soon as I can update you.                    Easy point and shoot for awesome photos.  I have had a Canon PowerShot S3, which is what I could afford 5 years ago.  It took good photos, but this T3i is amazing quality for $600. I recommend this for amateur shutterbug like me, whose is always taking family photos, wedding, parties, etc.                    If you want a DSLR to shoot video and you don't have a lot of money to spend on it, this camera is perfect for you. I bought it for a very good price and now I enjoy doing a lot of shooting and I'm getting all kinds of accesories for it. Btw, the 18 - 135mm lenses is the way to go. Do not get the 55mm because they won't get the job done.                    We are very pleased with the video on this camera. We are using Class 10 San Disk cards and getting superior quality. We have shot a few stills on it, but purchased it as an economical choice for pro HD video. The unit does shut off when it overheats - which is a good thing. If using for video, we recommend not shooting over 10-15 minutes in length on any shots at full HD. We also recommend a spare battery, spare cards, and allowing time for the unit to aclimate before using. This is a great choice for film makers on a budget. It is compatible with our Macs as well.
!###I made the switch to Canon after being disappointed by my Sony DSLR. Every photographer I know and respect has a Canon in their hand so I knew there had to be a reason.Right out of the box, this takes amazing photos! It's done surprisingly well even in low lighting without a flash. I've had very few blurry shots and the few that I did have were when the subject moved abruptly.So far I've just been using the auto settings, but this weekend I plan to read the booklet that came with it and really learn about the manual controls. With that said, if you're a beginner, I think you'll be impressed at how well the auto controls do for every day shooting.The HD video exceeded my expectations. Just know in advance that this is not intended to be a full fledged camcorder. If your video becomes too long, the camera will overheat and it will stop recording. This is what I've read any way. I haven't shot any video longer than a few minutes, so I haven't been able to test this theory. But I do understand I can't expect a DSLR to do what a camcorder does because they don't have the same mechanics. Still this camera is more than sufficient for short video clips and the clarity is very nice. It's much better than carrying around a DSLR and a camcorder on vacation!Just make sure your SDHC card has the number 6 or higher on it. The sales person didn't explain that to me and I got a card with a 4 on it. 4 is too slow for recording HD video. The camera will automatically stop recording after a few seconds.I'm in love with this camera so far and look forward to learning more about its features! The swivel screen is worth the extra money too. It really makes a difference and the colors are very accurate. The screen has a non-glare and smudge resistant finish which helps a lot.As far as construction, the location of the menu button is strange. It's on the left, and as a right handed person, it always feels out of reach. Everything else is being controlled with my right hand and it feels awkward when I have to control the menu with my left.A few people have mentioned the grip of the camera body. I do understand that. When I'm holding it, I always feel like I'm about to drop it. Not sure what to say about that. Just be sure to wear the strap that comes with the camera! :)UPDATE 6/19/12 - I've found the manual focus to be a bit of a pain for video. I am constantly refocusing my subjects and it makes a very loud sound on the video when I do it. This is my first HD camera, so I have no idea if this is common. I did read reviews for other cameras with auto-focus on video and customers often complained that the auto-focus did a poor job and they went back to manual. So I honestly have no idea if auto would be any better. Most people say manual is the way to go.When the subject is in focus, the quality is breathtaking. It's just getting there that seems to be an uphill battle.                    I'm not going to write a long winded review, all I will say is that this camera exceeded my expectations. I'm extremely happy with my purchase.                    The Canon Rebel T3i is the perfect camera for nature and landscape shots where you might hesitate to bring your expensive studio camera. It's perfect for vacations as well. Canon typically performs well, provides superb lenses, durability and great customer service. These are some of the reasons I stay with Canon. Amazon direct is fast and reliable with no surprises.                    Excellent for picture , however for video shoot you need to have a superior class memory card. Video will keep shutting down automatically aft 10 sec for need of better memory card.                    This camera its awesome, great quality picture and great quality materials, it has great price and lovely design i love this camera i used all the time                    All I expected it to be. I am a beginner and it is ready to shoot beautiful pictures right out of the box.                    I bought it for a month, it works very well and i love it very much. I want to tell other person to buy this product.                    Bought this for two reasons:1. As a backup camera to my Canon 5D Mark II, and2. As an APS-C 1.6 focal length multiplier to complement my various full frame lenses, thereby giving me a lot more focal length options.Works great.  Image quality is great.  Obviously not as robust as the 5D Mk II but overall a very good camera for the price.  There are controls quibbles that I have with all Canon cameras as their controls layouts simply do not compare favorably to my Nikons.  However, all cameras involve trade-offs of one kind or another--these are things that you just cope with and move on.Overall, a very good camera for the price.                    Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 Imaging with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS LensI purchased this camera for a upgrade for my Canon EOS Rebel T1i. I am amazed at the picture quality and ease of use. However, for a first time EOS user there will be a learning curve. The included Canon software is fantastic and one does not need to purchase any from another company. Although the kit lens, 18-55mm is adequate, better results will be obtained from optional Canon lenses.I also highly recommend the optional Canon Battery Grip BG-E8. When attached to the bottom of the camera it makes the camera more stable to hold and when two batteries are used, one does not have to worry about running out of battery power during extended shoots.A beginner can leave the camera set on "automatic" and let the camera do all the work, however an advanced photographer can use other settings and control the results more to their liking. Although I take mostly still photos, I am impressed with the video results. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who is seriously interested in digital photography.However, I would give Amazon shipping very low marks for shipping an expensive camera to me without a signature required upon delivery! The camera was left at my front door in the Florida heat for anyone to steal!                    Great Price ... Great Lens (135mm) and  Great shots...Video auto focus not so hot but in Video quality super!
!###This has been the best thing I have ever bought of amazon! I love doing photography and this was an upgrade for me and i have enjoyed this product right as soon as I opened it.                    This is my first DSLR camera and I absolutely love it.  The pictures are stunning and the camera is easy to learn.                    Grandaughter loves this present for her last birthday. Good choice for nice picture and functionality yet moderately priced. Recommend without reservation.                    very nice camera for beginners,lighter weight than i thought!Only thing that im not so happy with is that the kit does NOT include memory cardso i had to buy it seperately.and during video, how do i auto-focus  things?                    This camera is amazing, It takes great pictures and all of the controls are great. I love all of the functions and I think that this camera is a really good camera.                    Completely believe in Amazon and the product. Cannot fight with anyone as to which is better - Nikon or Canon but guys go for Canon....because I am suggesting it...;)                    Pretty good, the auto level on the audio is super annoying. You can't turn it off. So if there's any silence while shooting video the noise shoots way up.For photos and video its great, audio is horrible.Do yourself a favor and install magic lantern.                    Love my slr camera, still learning all it funtions and having a blast, need to lear about lenses and stuff to really get the juice out of it.Loving it so far.                    We are truly impressed, this camera takes great pictures, and especially with this lens 18-135 is one of the best. Thank you.                    This Camera's The Bombay! Mine was used from amazon warehouse and when I got it the thing was perfectly packed with NO sign of use. Beautiful condition and works perfecto mondo. Love the HD video although it's hard for me to focus sometimes manually. Pretty easy to learn the controls and this camera makes learning fun! I had a Nikon in the past and it was a disaster trying to learn everything on it. By the way........... after I'm done with my shots I go to photomonkeydotcom to edit and the pics come out so much more clear.
!###Love this camera! I decided to buy this once I was shelling out hundreds every time I took my kids to get pics done.  I took a 1 day class on how to use it and I must say I am so glad I did.  The product itself has worked out perfectly for my needs and the price I got on here was fair.                    It's a nice camera but hunts for focus in low light.  The images that come out of this camera cannot be beat. Since I take most of my pictures inside, I had to return it because of the erratic inside focusing. Outside, it was wonderful.                    Incredible piece of equipment. Hearty, handles well, gets the job done. I am a filmmaker who is using the camera mostly for the video sense. Shoots great in low light, beautiful images, professional quality, and so affordable. Highly recommend. Would also recommend buying an additional battery and memory card because you'll want to do a lot of shooting, and then buy a Nikon lens adapter and find some cheap MF Nikon lenses on ebay and play away.                    Best camera of all times good investment and high quality and features guaranteed, Canon makes the difference, do ur part!!!                    I am new to the DSLR world so take this as is.  The camera works for my use perfectly the controls are all easily accessible.  The screen is bright and perfect for viewing the pictures in the way you wanted them to be shot.  The kit lens that came with it works for my uses i am still getting comfortable with it.                    I really like this camera. Ive been eyeing this camera for a while now and thanks to amazon I know own it. I has a really comfortable size that makes it easy to carry around, the quality is incredible and takes amazing pictures. The camera arrived in time and had no problems with the shipping.                    I have already rated this camera, I have purchased two of them, loved the 1st. one destroyed it in a motorcycle accident took great pictures so much detail easy to use so I purchased a second one which my youngest son who is studying art in Italy is enjoying now,great camera. Peter C.                    The camera is everything that was promised and more. Amazing pics and videos. Easy to use and lots of cool features.                    My precious!!! A dream come true!I'm an amateur photographer and this camera has all I want, with an excellent price!!Canon rules                    This is absolutely my favorite camera I've ever owned. Going from simple point and shoots to a DSLR is like jumping from a sensible compact into a sports car.The features are immense. The quality of shots is just fantastic.The auto focus works great, the zoom is really impressive. I just can't say enough good things about this thing, and yet, my review is over.
!###This is one of the best cameras out there at a decent price for recording video. All of your settings are super easy to adjust and there are lots of good, free instructional videos available on the web.                    A refurbished product is every bit as good if not better than a brand new item and worth every penny. The only difficulty I had was coordinating with the UPS service they are not very customer service oriented.                    for years been doing my  photography hobbies with a little Kodak EasyShare an this my first pro level hardware it can almost run it selfgot it as a gift it has so many options it runs rings around most cameras even other DSLR it can run with most 35mm lens it speed is pare with higher end type  my  great uncle HERRAL LONG used one an hes a pro says a lot for what people class a starter level camerabattery runs longer then 2 hours  on full charge sating are easy to learn no touch screen like T4i but that's just more hardware has same trek sat up as T4ihas  a point an shot sat that makes it run like a point an shot type makes it real handy an anti shake works in film mod only thing that make it cooler is if it came in red                    Love everything about it. Only problem I had was the memory card that came with it was too small too even take a 4 second video. $20 later I had a class10 memory card and I was back in business :).                    This is a great camera, I purchased it to photograph my first newborn and have been very happy so far.                    Coming from the PowerShot line from Canon, this camera was easy to pick up. The automated modes do a good while we put in the effort to learn the manual mode. Works fine with the third party SD card and battery we got.                    I got this to record videos and it is amazing. I will never go back to my old camera. All I gotta do is change the lenses if somewhat I want a different zooming in view                    After owning a base rebel for 15 years, i was quite amazed at the quality of pictures and video this camera delivers.  I used it on vacation overseas and viewed the pictures on a big screen and was quite amazed how good they came out. Also this camera produces great video and is quite easy to use even though i haven't read the manual just yet.  Thanks Amazon for providing a great selection of rebels at unbeatable prices!                    I bought this camera  for filming music videos, ski edits, etc. and i also use it for everyday trips, and my teams cross country meets. I use this camera for everything and i haven't found any problems with it at all. Just buy it! The camera is fantastic!                    shipping was very fast! i love this camera. the detail on the photos is amazing. upon registering your product, canon gives you a 15% off coupon to spend in the canon store for accesories. It comes with a strap, battery, charger. Now all I need is a case.
!###Bought this as my first DSLR.  Great features for an entry level camera, but wish it did more.  For only $599, and you can get it cheaper here often, it is a great purchase and I highly recommend.                    Just as Advertised BRAND NEW! Factory Sealed! Been Using it for about a week now and love it THANKS!Box, camera, Accessories were in perfect condition!                    This is a real nice starter dslr camera. Solid and has plenty of features for the beginner.Best to develop skills on something like this.I have seen picture from this camera that are as good as those from the top Canon cameras.                    good to know that the expectation of a refurbished camera would be so high... in fact i was surprised to find out it was not so far from a brand new one.                    Works like a charm, is extremely reliable, and I just love the flip out screen. It makes any photoshoot a breeze and I take it with me everywhere. Its pretty light, and very fun to handle.                    Nice weight  and features . Not crazy about the standard lens that comes with it. My fault I should have paid attention when I ordered I was looking for a Zoom lens . Once I get to know the camera better and all it's features I'm sure I will enjoy it that much more . Great for what I need right now and that is to capture my life and family events .                    She has enjoyed the camera and has not expressed any issues. Thinking about getting one myself. Quite pricey. But, the quality is worthy                    This camera takes amazing pictures. Still learning about all the neat stuff that can be done, but I am very happy with this camera.                    I love this camera. It is user friendly, takes great, clear pictures. I'm an amateur photographer and it has been a lot of fun learning how to use it and try out all the different settings. Definitely recommend this camera to others.                    It works!  It's amazing!  My GF loves it and is exploring all of the features and settings.  Seeing how its a gift from me, I can't give much in the way of a texhnical review except that it was well received and is getting good use!
!###I'm pretty satisfied. Didn't know what to think because some of the negative reviews but got it at a great price and it works well.                    Look at what I filmed with my own dslr!Amazing experience indeed! Best camera ever, easy to use and stunning results.Enjoy the movie!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WU2z8HnCzGc                    The camera arrived in perfect condition. It has been easy learning to use it and the pictures are great. Don't know why I waited so long to get a digital SLR. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great camera.                    I'm new to the DSLR world, and I wanted a good camera for my upcoming trip with my Fiancee to Europe.  This certainly did the trick.  Lightweight enough to carry around all day (in a camera case backpack) with the second lens we bought at the same time as this.  This camera takes FANTASTIC pictures in all sorts of light.  2 weeks and 1800 pictures later, we're sold on it.                    I bought this camera based on a famous photography recommendation when he reviewed between t3i and 60D and he recommended t3i becouse there were not major feature on 60D so that people would buy. I made my decision and I am happy with it. never regret.                    Has the 24fps option for film-like video. Can get a nice and shallow depth of field. Good white-balance features. Footage can get some extra noise in low-light. No image stabilization.                    Its not a 5D, but it shoots nice video along with excellent still pictures. I had to relearn the button positions from my old 300D, but that is coming along. It has a ton of features. The image quality is right up there with anything that doesn't have a full frame sensor. I like the sturdy feel of the build and the relatively light weight, again, considering all the features. I shot a lot of pictures on my old 300D and made enlargements of up to 16x20 and printed them at home and they are awesome, and that was with just a 6.3 mega pixel sensor. I'm looking forward to blowing some of the new ones up to that size. it is interesting because even when you use Photoshop, you really have to zoom way in to see the actual pixels for sharpening, and i am not seeing much, if anything,  in the way of loss or distortion.                    I started my SLR journey with a 35mm AE-1 and F-1, so I already had a preference for the Canon brand.  I spent a lot of time looking before I jumped into the digital pond.  I didn't have the $$$$ to get a D series body, and I was not too happy with how the early EOS bodies were set up.  What changed my mind was the fully rotatable view screen.  It is nice to be able to turn the screen so I can hold the camera high or low and still be able to see what I am shooting, or to turn the screen completely around so it is protected by the camera body.It has been replaced by the T4i (the video mode is now accessed with the on/off lever and not the wheel), and the T5i (the video screen is now a touch screen)If you want to start doing digital, I highly recommend picking one up (and since it is a couple of generations old, you should be able to score a good deal)                    I'm just in love with the quality of pictures but such is to be expected: a first DSLR camera is a lot like a first girlfriend.Except it doesn't fall apart when things get rough. Both the camera and the lens survived several drops including one off my belt during a casual bike ride. Tumbling off the moving bike left some scratches in the plastic, took off chunks of the edges, and bent the aluminum flash shoe, but the camera functionality seems unaffected! I have no idea how the lens mechanisms still works. The thing is a brick.                    This camera is okay I love it the price picture quality is very good I have no problem with my T3iCanon make's good camera this is my second and looking for my third.
!###I spent hours and hours, days upon days, weeks upon weeks trying to get good jpegs and videos from my T3i to no avail.  Sharpness was only fairly good (even when manually focused) with two different lens - not razor sharp like most of my previous Olympus cameras.  Colors were not fully lifelike so the images looked "digital" instead of filmlike. Here again I was spoiled by my previous good experiences with Olympus cameras.  I did generally like the T3i's video, but here again colors were often inconsistent and the .mov files were huge and a pain to work with.After three months of fustration I bought an inexpensive Olympus Pen camera and was delighted with it's still image color and sharpness.And I also bought an inexpensive Panasonic SD90 camcorder for video because it's delivers superior image sharpness, image stabilization and zoom capabilities compared to my T3i in the more efficient ACHVD format.  I will sell the T3i because I want top quality still image and video and the Canon T2i, T3i, 60D and 7D deliver only mediocre quality in my opinion.                    get this item very quick ! about in 2 or 3 days. camera is still good . if have enough money , want more                    It is easy to get tunnel vision with all these glowing reviews on Amazon.  However, this camera really doesn't have any standout features.  Its the same old technology that has been around for years.  You are still going to have to wait a ton of time between shots, the burst mode is slow, and the burst mode does not support focusing between shots.  The view finder is not going to actually show you the picture you are going to get since it is an optical viewfinder.  And the viewfinder is going to black out when you actually take the shot.  Sure, all these traditional SLR cameras take great pictures, but really, what camera at this price doesn't.  What are you really looking for at this price point?  For me, it is fast between shots and can burst fast so I am sure to get a great shot.  I hate cameras that make me wait between shots until the camera is ready to take another picture.If you want the hidden gem in the SLR camera world, check out the Sony SLT technology.  It is a new technology that is much faster and allows the viewfinder and focus mechanisms to function like they should.  I have the SLT-A57 and I think you can tell from the reviews that it is as good or better than any of these SLR cameras.No, I don't work for Sony.  I just think that someone should point out the fact that there are other options out there and better technology available.                    great product! great product! great product! great product! great product! great product! great product! great product! great product! great product!  adsfasdasdfsdfasdfasd                    I did not have much to say about the camera itself except that we are OK with it. What I would bring to your attention is the $400 rebate that is offered when you buy this camera and the Canon PIXMA Pro9000 Mark II Inkjet Photo Printer, which I never got. I placed the order for both the camera an the printer back in March 2012. Then I only received the camera, the printer did not come. Amazon refunded me for the printer and told me to place another order for the printer and said that it would still qualify for the rebate. I did as they told me and submitted the rebate documents. And then I waited and waited and did not receive the rebate. I contacted Amazon so many times but they did not solve the problem. For a typical call, the customer service staff would say "Let me do some research here" and put me on hold and then he would say "you'll be contacted via email". Then I got the email saying they needed more information from me but did not specify what they needed, so I had to call them again. Yesterday they finally forwarded my case to their promotion and rebate department. But then I got an email from a promotion and rebate staff saying " I suggest that you place a new order for the item, Canon PIXMA Pro9000 Mark II Inkjet Photo Printer (3295B002)so that you'll be able to avail of the $200 rebate.  Make sure that the printer is shipped and sold by Amazon.I hope this works for you."  I am not quite sure what this staff was thinking by making this suggestion, but it reflects how Amazon customer service works, i.e. fooling their customers.                    I really hate to say this, being a Canon guy who has tons of Canon camcorders and cameras, but this T3i is pure JUNK.I got the 18-55mm kit lens and tried it out.not a single image is sharp! I am a pro photog and video guy with 40 years of experience, so I know how to take a picture or shoot video.Set the camera on AUTO mode, what can be wrong here... well the same blurry image. Nothing in focus, yet it showed it was in focus. Yes, the LIVE VIEW or the optical view does show a CLEAR image, but when loaded onto a computer, it's all blurry when you look at it a bit closer. I compaired with several Nikon DSLR just to make sure maybe my eyes are not good as use to be... the Nikon images from a low cost D-40 is far superior with a kit lens than this 18mp image is full of noise in full sunlight, on AUTO mode or ANY OTHER settings.This was out of the box BAD.Sent it Canon and they sent it back as 'fixed'. NOTHING has changes and they say it's normal and all is OK.Am asking you, If I shoot a 1.2Mp setting on a D40 Nikon and a 18mp setting on T3i and the Nikon is superior quality and sharpness then this T3i what do you think it's wrong? To Canon repair it is fine.Then I set it to 1.2Mp or slightly higher on the T3i and the images is sooooo blurred even a toy camera can do better.Next I used an old Canon SD-800 camera set at 1mp (close to it) and it's image is superiour to this Canon 18Mp !So, it's not me and  not knowing how to use a camera. I have six DSLR and many other cams.Canon refuse to replace this LEMON and just giving me the run around.In addition the Movie mode shuts off with a Class-10 SD card after a ten seconds. NOT selected the 10 seconds shots... but it does it on its own. After five tries, finally gets to record in video mode. The image quality is so bad, with the kit lens and other lenses from 24mmm to 50mm. Makes no difference, but the prime lens is a 'sharper' BLURRY image... if you can believe it.So, I have a $1K down the toilet and Canon don't stand behind their products.I urge everyone buying any Canon model DSLR to check it out within a few days and if no good, take it back to the STORE!I missed that opportunity and now stuck with this 'repair' revolving door and getting nowhere.This maybe a refurbish by Canon or someone taken this back to the store, repackaged and sold as new.... at Walmart.I don't blame Walmart, and I don't think they have anything to do with refurbish or re-sold cameras without indicating as such. The inventory showed as NEW camera.                    There are many excellent tech reviews there for this camera. I won't repeat.Hope these little details help you to make your mind:(1) Photo quality is good. I wish some controls would be easier to set/access (e.g., HDR, ..)(2) Video talking is an obvious after-thought. If you take lots of video, buy a point-and-shot or a real camcorder, which makes video-talking a lot of easier and more fun.(3) If you have Mac running 10.4, you should know that none of the new software coming with this camera works! You would have to buy a new computer too! (Probably not the first time being forced to upgrade?)..                    BE AWARE!!!!!! MADE IN TAIWAN!!!!! sorry Canon/amazon but you really dropped the ball on this one!!!!!! I have experience in purchasing Canon cameras, so, I know what I'm talking about. This is a joke to the knowlegeable photographer. may work great, may take great pictures, but and only BUT.....made in Taiwan? Really? sorry Canon, this is a joke and a really bad one.                    I bought this camera on Christmas sale with FREE bundle of backpack, UV filter and 16 GB memory card. This free bundle was a selling point for me as a price of a camera itself was not the cheapest around. After receiving a shipment I found out that extras are not in. I have waited a while and after a week gave a call to amazon. It took me an hour to explain the situation. Finally, operator agreed to issue $50 credit so I can buy the above mentioned items. Guess what? Two month have passed and there is no credit and no bundle, still.This is beyond me that a company with such reputation let such things happen to their loyal customers. Although, I'm satisfied with the product itself the way they treated above mentioned issue is unacceptable, they completely ruined my shopping experience!!!                    I bought a new T3i and they gave me an old one. The "remove" button doesn't work well. If I have time I will return it.
!###Nice product.As an entry-level photographer, it's enough for me.Two bad things:1) the grip is a little bit loose.2) I can see a small white spot inside of the lens glass, probably a dust.                    I have had several cameras in the digital Rebel series. Each a little better than the last. I reviewed the newer models and can't see enough improvement to warrant the extra cost. To say I love the Canons would be an understatement.                    Everything was the way it said.All parts came,and camera is working without problems.I'm very happy with a product. Love it                    This camera is great. Amazing quality. For the price it is at i'd say that's a great deal. it doesnt get any better                    Wonderful camera, works great! Bought it like new - came as if it was brand spanking new! Manual tells you everything you need to get started. So start clicking away!                    There enough settings on it to keep you busy learning and testing.  It is the best thing I have spent money on, and I don't think anyone will regret buying this camera.                    This is one the best I ever worked with, the way it handles and works with all the projects. This cameras makes life a good thing.Thanks so much!                    I just received this camera today, refurbished, in the mail and I am absolutely in love.I previously owned (borrowed) a Canon EOS Rebel T3 and that was mind blowing compared to the land of point-and-shoot that I had previously been wallowing in. This camera has impressed me even more, even though it is supposedly a step up. The resolution of the LCD screen is astounding and, as always, Canon is able to produce the most crisp and vivid colors that impress even with the kit lens.Once one begins to familiarize themselves with the Manual setting and adjusting the ISO, aperture, and shutter, there is no limit to the quality of artistic photography. As far as video, this camera is not really ideal for recording children or sports events, but more short clips that change focus or take on a more movie-like approach.Overall, I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who is looking to step up from the basic DSLR camera.                    Love it so far.  My only complaint is the autofocus seems to spend a little too long trying to decide what to focus on, so I'm mostly using manual focus.                    Perfect for an entry level in photography. It only fails in Linux support for its software. I really love it.
!###I bought this camera as a gift to my co-parent so she can use it to take lots of pictures of our amazing son.  While I am not a camera expert I have owned a couple of good SLRs in the film era and take good pictures for an average owner.  I am just so happy with how good the pictures are coming out.  The lighting and the colors all look great to me.  I don't use it for motion, only stills.  My last great camera was a Canon A-1, and so far I like this camera just as much.                    Looks and functions as if new. Sealed in factory refurbished box. Great value. What more can I say. Lots of fun to use this very nice camera.                    It takes fine pictures although improved kit lenses would make some improvements.  The price is very appealing and the brand name &#34;Canon&#34; assures upgrade cameras will be available.                    Lots of features & settings, but produces excellent photos. Not a lot of helpful info in the owners manual on how to get the best pictures, but I have learned a lot from other photographers. Very different from a point and shoot camera. Always use the flash for the best shots. I would definitely recommend this camera.                    its a pretty good dslr but there are a few things i've noticed. the lens that it comes with isn't very smooth so if your planning on a nice smooth zoom in for the video... think again. otherwise yeah good pictures great video. i'de suggest shooting 720p at 60fps. less motion blur and no one really notices its not 1080. anyway i like the camera but if i ever damage this one i plan on getting a d7.                    I wanted a camera for my stock photography and personal use. So far I can say that the camera does well in both departments. In the case of my stock photos I have so much control over how i want to picture to look like, this is coming from how i used to take photos using my sisters old nikon. Its a great improvement, and shooting in raw lets me bring out every bit of color when i develop my photos using light room. Haven't had any problems with it and its been a year now. For what it cost me I definitely place this in the worth it list. Long term this camera and I are going to be great friends, and i highly recommend this for anyone looking into buying a dependable camera.                    I ordered this camera thinking it might be a little worn down. NO WAY its like brand new! I love it and I am totally recommending this seller. They sent it even a day early! :)                    Excellent camera, my dad absolutely loved it!!!Easy to use and light compared to his other cameras.He wouldn't stop talking about it. Really glad I decided to get this for him. =)                    Gave it to my wife as a gift. Shes been having a great time with it. Our Daughter in-law took all of our wedding pictures with it!                    After an 8 yr hiatus from my 35mm Pentax, which was lost in the flood waters of Hurricane Katrina, it feels great to have this heavy cam in my hands being able to manually push my own settings.  I actually just wanted to share photos, since everyone else seems to have covered all aspects of this cam.  I can't wait to invest in more lens and filters!!
!###This "body only" purchase is our 2nd T3i.  A year ago I decided to switch from 13 years with Canon GL1 into the DSLR HD world and the T3i was highly recommended by a videographer friend.  Cumbersome at first, but have enjoyed the jump in quality and versatility of DSLR. Need a good understanding of manual settings (basic photography).  Found a good 18-250 zoom needed for outdoor action videos at a summer camp.  Adding Magic Lantern has been just the ticket.  Would not recommend for run-and-gun style video as is typical with camcorders though.  I had to re-think and change my camcorder shooting style, but have adapted successfully.  Added facility has been the quick availability of mixing stills and video which was impossible in the camcorder era.                    Bought this camera for a present. Before the t5I came out or i would have sprung for the T4i since it seems that the price seems to have come down after a new model is relased. But other than that its a great camera and its all you need if your shooting family photos or some action shoots. would recomend this to anyone.                    If you plan on using an external microphone (which everyone should), google &#34;magic lantern.&#34;  It will allow you to have mic levels displayed on the info screen while shooting video.  So important.This camera is of such high quality, you will be using it for at least 5-10 years.  I just now got rid of my Rebel XT (circa 2005-ish) and it was still taking great photos.                    The rebel t3i is a huge upgrade to the t2i. The flip screen makes a huge difference. I do some video production at home and I use it quite a bit. Also, the camera holds up quite well.                    I am an architecture student just starting out in the world of amateur photography and this camera has been nothing but great for me so far.  The folding screen is really nice for protecting it when not in use and can be useful for certain weird shots, but obviously I mostly use the viewfinder as most people will.  The kit lens is decent, and I bought the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens sold on Amazon as well and that can provide some really amazing crisp, low depth of field shots when combined with this camera.  I haven't used many of the modes, pretty much just set it on aperture priority and go for 90% of my shots, but nice to have all the options available.  Good for HDR imagery with the 3 level bracketing but if you want 5 levels this doesn't have an automatic way of doing those.  All in all a great camera with a serviceable lens for beginning photographers.                    Love my camera! Already have one now this is my back-up one. I love the ISO button on the top. Great camera would buy it again.                    Very complete camera! Easy to use, several functions, great picture quality! Took great shots from nature and landscape, motion subjects, it was a great purchase,                    This body is rock solid and worthy of purchase for ANY and ALL people entering or needing an advanced DSLR camera. I purchased the body only - I have several lenses from my previous Canons which are NOT currently 'IS' lenses. I've been shooting people, places and other things for more than 45 years and LOVE this camera. It's extremely mobile. I can just flip open my tripod lock and GO! My only issue with the T3i concerns the GRID functions. These work only in LIVE VIEW MODE (as I've found so far). As soon as you move up to manual for full control, you lose the grid (I use the 3x3), which helps me set my composition. Yes, I can use my eye to place an imaginary grid in the viewfinder, but WHY when one is readily available.With my additions on the camera already, video/image reviews will be plentiful. As I learn new tricks and shortcuts, I'll inform the public so they too can enjoy ALL of the features of this outstanding camera. The articulating screen wasn't necessary, yet it IS what made me choose this model over the T2i. The prices were just too close to pass it up. I'll be adding more T3i and T2i cameras to my photo biz in the coming months, as well as trying out the 'IS' lenses. This camera is very tight on power consumption and has extreme accuracy when you set it for pinpoint focusing as I do for model and portrait photography work. The macro features are also on par with its more advanced (and WAY higher priced), big brothers to this camera. Now, the 18.1MP sensor.....WOW! The image sizes of the CMOS sensor allow me great latitude in adjusting and tweaking my RAW images anytime I wish to be creative. If you are just starting out, are bored with the out of date "point-n-shoot," want to upgrade your digital cams, or you want to move from film to digital, the T3i will not disappoint. It's an excellent camera for ANY level of photographer - beginner or experienced pro, this camera really shines. Oh, and the video.....It's 1080p HD, nothing more needs to be said.I ordered it here at Amazon, really a great price: http://amzn.to/128qxby                    this is my first digital slr and I'm impressed with all the features, picture quality, easy upload to computer & ease of use                    Very good camera and easy to use. This is my second Canon camera I have and love them both. I'll stay with Canon
!###Beautiful screen, review your photos on the spot more effectively than ever before, great quality photos with extremely high resolution, love shooting with the night mode which practically invalidates darkness as a negative condition.                    This camera is a great buy. Easy to use and takes nice pictures. Many options make this camera fun and feeling like a professional photographer.                    I also bought a 55-250 mm ISII lens to go with it. They made a wonderful pair together. The quality, sharpness and vivacity of the colors were astounding. I am an amateur photographer and I thoroughly enjoy this camera for its features and ease of use.                    Overall good performance. Built in flash disappointing. Auto focus performs poorly in low lighting situations. Will be buying a real flash which hopefully will improve results. This is a complex camera and will take a learning curve to determine what it can really do.  With the 18-135 lens you don't really need a telephoto because the 18 MP allows severe cropping with little loss of image quality.                    Great pictures, very clear. Phots's of people come out very clear, so easy to use can make anyone a good photographer                    This is a wonderful camera. It works great when using video/recording as well as the picture quality-both settings are great. Great product period.                    I am not the only one who loves this camera, my friends at work and on facebook are amazed at my photos and what the camera can do...I am not disappointed!                    This camera is everything I expected and more.  I haven't gotten to really read the manual as of yet, but being a Canon EOS person I can make it do what I want in most of the modes.  The picture definition is totally awesome.                    Best camera ever! I am just starting photography but I picked up this camera and started using it manually with out reading the manuel and it was easy to use and takes amazing pictures! Check out my pictures at [...] You'll love this camera so stop looking and get it now!                    Great  camera, just what I was looking for.Much better then the one I had before.I really like the ease of operation!
!###This was a nice company to work with, no hidden or surprise fees. it arrived promptly and I am so happy with my new camera!                    This is a replacment for an old camrea I had. The pictures are incrediably impressive and if you read the manual, which from the reviews some have not, you will find that this camera will create some of the most amazing pictures. If I had to nit pick anything on the camera, I would have to say that the lens cap should have a tie connected to it as I almost lost the lens cap twice.                    Great quality!!! I love it!!!Clear pictures!!! Video looks like a movie to me.I use it to do short documentaries and capturing special moments in my life.                    I love this camera, I bought it as a back up for my 6D and it takes beautiful pictures! It's affordable and even takes videos with AF!                    I researched several SLR's before deciding on the Canon T3i. I'm happy with my choice so far, having purchased the camera first of all to take high quality photos of fairly small works of sculpture art, using the Canon lens.Reliable, was delivered in terms of time and works perfectly, I recommend this product and its selling at 100%                    just sold my T3 to get this model and am loving every minute with this new version. with all the new features on this compared to the T3 is amazing. The flip out screen is awesome, not to mention that the resolution is like 4x what the screen was on the T3. 18 megapixels instead of 12, better build quality with rubber accents, better sd card placement and external mic.I'm not using this camera for any Videos and not sure why anyone would but that another story. I would highly recommend this tho the beginner or the intermediate photographer. has the same sensor and some of the more upgraded Canon's and some of the newer one's like the T4i.All you need is a few better lenes and you are on your way to some great pictures and fun. Best purchase I've made in some time and would recommend getting it on Amazon for the price and shipping prices are much better than I've seen from most other sites.                    Camera has great features and the flip out screen is a must have. Would have gave it 5 stars except the battery life is not very good if video is your thing.                    Just getting into photography. Couldn't ask for a better start-up camera. Very durable and lots of options to choose form in manual mode.                    I was wanting to get a nice camera for vacations and this is the one that I seen recommended. Got it here for a great price. Camera works great.                    LOVE the T3i. With 18 megapixels, full HD video, and the Canon name, it'll still be high tech in 10 years +. The two main upgrades from the T3 are 12.2 vs. 18 megapixels, and the fact that the T3i has an articulated screen. And you WILL use the articulated screen often -- for overhead shots, low angle shots, self portraits, setting up tripod based video/still shots (flip the screen around so you can see your shot as you tweak backgrounds).Bought mine as a package deal from Cardinal Camera (best prices ANYWHERE).  Skip the package with the 75-300mm zoom.  Get the package with the 55-250mm IS zoom.  (more below on that)The two main T3i upgrade points (megapixels and articulated screen) do make it cost a good bit more than the T3, but the upgrades are well worth it. As for the 75-300 vs 55-250 IS lens -- IS is the key - image stabilization. A friend of mine with the 75-300 lens said, "It's practically worthless. I'll sell it to you for 10 bucks. I hate that lens." Without IS, you're doomed unless it's a cloudless day at high noon, or you're carrying a tripod around with you, or you're zoomed out to less than 150mm or so. I don't recall the exact numbers, but I believe IS gives you something like 4 additional stops before your shots get blurry. That's major, and again, well worth the extra money.  And with the 55-250 IS lens, you won't miss the 50mm difference.  In fact, if you want to zoom in that much, you'd be better off blowing up your pic taken with the IS lens.  It'll still be sharper than a pic with at 300mm zoom.After an exhaustive search, I found Cardinal Camera had the best deal on a T3i package. In fact, best deals anywhere on the T3i and a number of other cameras I was considering. Came quickly in a carefully packed box. Lots of goodies, though I will probably get some higher quality uv filters to protect my lenses - filters with multilayer coating to reduce glare. If you want to carry the goodies around, they practically fill the included bag. Not enough room for all of it, plus the camera.Next time I'm in the market for photography supplies, Cardinal Camera will be my first stop. I don't know when that will be though. I'm perfectly happy with my T3i. Like it a whole lot better than I would a T3 or anything similar, and I didn't see a need to go way up in price to a T4i.If you're still on the fence about spending a big chunk of change on a camera, just go for it. This camera isn't a piece of technology. It's a stack of priceless photo albums. It's vacation pictures worthy of framing. It's family portraits. It's memories.
!###Great camera, good price, and it takes great pictures.  It is easy to use, although I have barely scratched the surface on all the features.                    This was my first try on any DSLR camera. Had the T2i for my brother last year and used it for a bit. But not a complete go through.After a thorough research on all Canon cameras out there (did not try nikon as out of budget), preferred this over some higher ends and better prices compared to the lower end ones.Pros: Good picture quality, great lenses available (using 18-55 and 55-250mm IS II), Good screen functions, Great manual functionality.Cons: A bit on the heavier side, Body looks a bit dull but is solid, Some settings not available as compared to some higher versions(which is not actually a con but i felt they could have added it)Requirements: A tripod, External Flash (if clicking many night photos), Remote controller...Get these get better picture qualities.All-in-all a good product at a great price...                    I though all digital cameras around 10 megapixels would be the same. No way this baby is amazing our 10 month old son looks so much better on this than with any other digital camera we have ever owned. That includes some of the canon mid rang units like the s10.It is Rey easy to use on auto, but also has millions of custom options which we are still learning. I would absolutely recommend this camera to friends and family.                    Feeling constrained by my point and shoot and having played around with friends' DSLRs I decided I wanted to take this step, but its not for everyone.Is it for you? Its not worth getting a DSLR in general if your just going to keep it on auto-shot and really you don't get much from the camera if you do so, especially considering how large it is. If your just looking for better image quality I'd say go for a mirrorless interchangeable lens or "compact system" camera (as they call it on amazon)but if your willing to learn ( or through trial and error) you can get stunning and beautiful shots in conditions you never thought possible, I have really been breath taken by some of the photos as they appear for the first time on my computer monitor, then my jaw really dropped again when I started shooting in RAW format and editing in photoshop, but again, you have to be willing to tinker with settings/modes and eventually lenses, but once you do so you'll never want to go back.  Well now that your looking at entering the field of semipro/ enthusiasts photography this is one of, if not, the best entry cameras you can get. The camera delivers in almost every front, in terms of image quality, options, versatility, and only falls slightly short on its continuous shooting rate, as well as the auto focus can and will fail in low light and tricky conditions, this can simply be overridden by manual focus which isn't difficult once you get the hang of it. If you can afford it, get a new lens, the lens this comes paired with is decent but the auto focus is slow. Cannon (as well as 3rd party companies like sigma) have a huge range of great lenses and while lenses are expensive, keep in mind they will last a lot longer then the camera itself. Moving on, the flip screen is very useful for low/ high angles and I've taken some interesting backwards shots. In terms of video, the built in microphone is good for what it is, but if your a little serious, you want to grab and external mic, which it does have support for. Now the only tricky thing in video is that it does not have continuous autofocus, so time to beef up that manual focus skill. It has a HDMI out, so you can view directly on your TV, and the neat software by cannon allows you to view and control your camera through your computer when its hooked via USB. The battery lasts for ages and can be swapped out, the flash provided is fine but is rarely used as it makes most situations harsh without the ability to control the strength like an attached flash does/some DSLRs(it does have a standard mount. finally I wish this camera had GPS for geotaging pictures, not essential but would be nice.In Review, this is a great camera, and will get you very far in photography, with few limitations except your own knowledge and imagination.                    Love this camera. I like the flip out screen. I miss my rotating selection on the body though, so clicking through each photo is annoying, but I'm glad it shoots HD video and has a flip out screen. That's really helpful.                    This camera is so easy to use and has the best results!  More than I expected.  I should have bought this a long time ago instead of thinking about it so long.                    C'mon . This is a Canon Rebel. You just can't go wrong with this model, this manufacturer, or the name. I bought this for my daughter as a step-up from a film camera. She couldn't be happier.                    After reading all of the reviews, I purchased this camera.  My friends with Nikon's in the same price range are drooling over this t3i.  I am admittedly a novice photographer, but this camera provides plenty of room for me to grow and even takes great pictures with my currently, limited knowledge.                    I am not a professional... I just like taking pictures of my kids and occasionally my friend's kids. The quality of pictures is amazing for someone who doesn't have any idea what she is doing, and to me that is all that matters. I read the reviews, decided to give it a try, and fell in love with the camera. My kids are only little once and I wanted amazing pictures of them to capture their youth and this camera achieves that. It very simple to use.                    For my purposes this is a great digital SLR.  I also picked up the zoom lens so I feel very fortunate to have the flexibility for for money.  I have the fold out LED screen which is a nice feature.
!###Reminds me of my Canon AE-Program. Takes great pictures. Love the 55-250 zoom lens. More than happy with the purchase.                    I have taken Over 4000 photos so far and it allows me to come up with amazing photos. I do not recommend it for doing video if you are thinking of using it for video because it does not have auto focus.                    It's a good camera for begginers.The problem is that the camera  have a dead pixel!But all the others things are ok!                    Faster shipment and right price, I liked it, If I have to buy it again I  will purchase with you guys .                    It took some to get the order shipped but worth waiting. Having single lense for most of the occasion is a b I g plus.  Will recommend to anyone.                    I love it!I've taken pictures in the day, at night, and at a baseball game.So far so good.No complaints.                    The design and materials are very slolid, but the camera its light. The photo quality it's amazing with out even trying.                    I've had this camera for a number of months now.  I am amazed at how detailed the images come out.  They are outstanding!  I was able to buy a a Pentax PK Lens to Canon EOS EF Mount Adapter and use some old lens with the newer mount (the old lens still perform as good as the kit lens).  First of, I am coming from a point-and-shoot camera background, but I did have prior knowledge on how to operate DSLR's.  out of the box, I was able to take stunning images with a breeze.  I even took some close-up images of the moon with a telephoto lens.On a side note, I also installed Magic Lantern(free) onto this camera, and was able to get high end camera features easily.All in all, this camera is the way to go for new or moderate DSLR users.Ratings:Image quality  10/10Ease of use  8/10Weight  9/10Kit Lens  9/10Durability  10/10Features  9/10                    So i have been using this camera for well over a year now and its the best camera out there. It takes the most beautiful pictures and stunning video, but since there is no auto focus for video its really hard to get it perfect. Its time consuming, but for taking pictures there isn't much to say. Only ITS THE BEST CAMERA OUT THERE THAT THANKS THE BEST PICTURES EVER.                    I still haven't used every single feature on the camera, because there are simply too many on it.  The pictures we take come out great, even in the auto setting.  Video looks great as well.  For an entry level DSLR, this thing fits the bill perfectly.  The addition of the tilt and swivel screen over the previous year is a wonderful change.
!###I'm a camera noob and this thing takes terrific photos.  VERY good purchase and will be used for many years to come.                    Excelente compra.  Pude usar los aditamentos de mi vieja camara Canon de rollo (lentes, flash, cobertor, etc). Es una gran ventaja que estas compa&ntilde;ias dieran la alternativa de usar otras partes del equipo fotografico y no tener que tirarlas a la basura.  El desempe&ntilde;o de la camara es ideal.  Las fotos son muy buenas y el video es de gran calidad.  Estoy muy contento con mi 600D y ademas no tuve que tirar mi inversion anterior                    Canon T3i is just what I expected, it's quite easy to learn how to use it, everything is on the manual. It works as well as for an amateur than a professional, is just perfect                    I've had this camera for a few months now, and I must say I've enjoyed it immensely. I bought it mostly for the video mode and it has not disappointed. The stills I've taken have come out beautifully, with the RAW workflow allowing for indescribably control over the image. The specs speak for themselves and Canon dependability is second to none. If you're looking for your first, or second or third DSLR, the t3i will not disappoint.                    I'll get right to the point.  This is my first DSLR and I just love it! There's a bit of a learning curve, but not too difficult.  The camera's easy to use and the pictures are incredible. The HD video will make you look like a pro. In fact, this thing makes taking great pictures unbelievably simple and at least for me, makes me look like a much better photographer than I am. If you have an eye on how to frame a picture, do it and the Canon T3i will do the rest. Want to take great pictures?  Grab a T3i. It can make a cardboard box look great!  6 Stars!                    I'VE BEING USESD THIS CAMERA FOR AOUT A YEAR AND IS AN AMAZING CAMERA, IS MY FIRST RELEX AND WORKS GREAT FOR VIDEO...!!!                    Awesome camera, easy to learn features and great seller for this product!  I can't begin to tell you how happy I am with this purchase!  I have borrowed "good"cameras from a friend who knows and told her I was looking for a camera that I could change out lenses for wide angle and telephoto and extreme telephoto use.  This is exactly what I wanted for the times I need that and the times I don't.  Awesome camera for the price!!!!                    I got this product on a deal for the thanks giving .. working very well and I am highly satisfied for the price I paid for it.                    just as described, a fantastic and easy to learn DSLR camera. a great choice, just make sure to select your lenses carefully and don't get the stock lenses.                    Purchased for trip to Africa, one of the best purchases I have ever made. Easy to learn, as a beginner, and gain confidence to take better and better photos. You can grow into this one and have it for a long time.
!###Wonderful starter camera, bought it for the wife and she absolutely loves it. Has many features, though it will take some time for the wife to familiarize herself as the amount of options is plentiful.                    This camera is my first DSLR camera and I am impressed every time I use it. This camera make me look like a professional photographer. Easy to use standard settings as well as the ability to create custom setting for the enthusiast. The included Lens takes amazing close up photos because of its included images stabilization. I would buy this again and again. Worth every penny!!!                    First canon rebel and it seems to be a great camera for a starter. If you are like me you will need to buy a book on how to effectively use this camera or just buy a cheap digital camera.                    Camera functions are so awesome & I love it Cant wait for a trip to come up.I love everything about it, the fact it was sent on time to was even a better deal.Canon software for computer editing sucks but I use iPhoto & it's superior.True deal!!!!!!                    This is a great camera. My husband and I are totally just beginners/hobby camera users, and we've been able to produce pictures that totally wowwed our family and friends. We hope to learn more and more about photography and I can already tell this camera was a great option!                    I would recommend this product to someone else. Camera is everything i need and  takes good photos. Will stick with Canon                    I love this camera!I know that I will not have to buy another one unless this one just stops working!  Make sure to get the more advanced memory card though if you plan to use it for Video.                    Pictures come out amazing. I never knew what I was missing until I bought this camera. The only feature that it is missing is the continuous auto-focus during video mode. I believe the new T4i adds this functionality. I am no professional, but I have taken some photos that come out amazing.                    I am writing this review not because I purchased t3i but because I purchased 6D. I've had t3i for 2 years and must have taken over 50,000 pictures if not more. I decided to "upgrade" and got myself 6D for 2.5K. And guess what? I do not any SIGNIFICANT improvement over t3i. What do I see is how light and easy to use t3i is. I am sure a 2.5K is much better than t3i. It has to be. However, for the amateur photographer who just likes to shoot pictures of his kids, friends, vacation sights t3i is the best camera. I will still probably keep 6D and use t3i.                    I like the item but was very disappointed by the way the item was packaged! Camera needed a lot of cleaning.
!###I finaly chose this camera and I'm glad I did, it's great, especially for the price. I did after buying this find a bundle that has everything in it for only a little more. The bundle is the way to go in my opinion. You get everything you need!!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0062N6VHA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0062N6VHA&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwworkoutwei-20                    I bought this for my wife at the recommendation of a professional photog...oh my God! This camera takes the most amazing photographs! Not one con. Only pros! Buy it, or save money to get it!                    The camera takes good photos and it's easy to handle. I only do not recommend the 18-55 lens, because doesn't have zoom.                    I'm amateur photographer, this camera let to me take excellent pictures and record video in high definition too. Perfect pictures, easy handling and light weight, You can dispose of many accesories a good price, lenses, filters and many others implements for photographers.                    This is the best gift i could ever gif to myself, i was getting crazy for it since the first time i saw it in publicity. Thank You :D                    just great great quality great controls perfect camera, i recomend this camera to anyone looking for a high quality camera in this price range                    Bought this camera as a replacement for a T2i.  It is a great camera with all of the features you would expect.  Everything works great, but if you have a PC running Windows 7, you may have connectivity issues when you try to connect the camera to the computer.                    I already have the T2i and when I decided to try out the T3i I was not disappontied.  I love the features and the video HD is really sharp.                    I bought this camera just a few days ago and so far am very impressed with its low-light abilities. I don't even have to use the flash indoors at night! I think this is a wonderful camera. The colors captured are very true to life, and with the flash it seems to get pretty crisp results. I definitely recommend this camera. I don't know about sports or intense action shots yet, I read from Cnet.com that it may not perform well in those areas, but we shall see! I do notice that it is MUCH slower in the Live View mode, so I've been just looking through the ancient peep-hole, and it is very quick!                    The camera arrived promptly as promised and behaved exactly as advertised. It is very easy to use and takes very good pictures.
!###I just received my camera today and I bought it take videos because on YouTube it look like great quality but my quality was terrible. I know that the videos on YouTube have been color corrected but my videos are coming out very pixely. I also own the xsi and the quality of photo on that camera is much better.                    I had to return this item and Roberts took it back no questions asked. Great service. I hope to be able to do business with them in the future. A+                    After a long search comparison , I found this reliable camera !Picture quality is very nice , easy to use .                    Hi, I am interested in buying this camera, but I would like to know how it was used and how many shots have you done? the surface of the lens is completely untouched? was not scratched? thanks                    I got this camera with the kit lens and was so disappointed in general with 1. the horribly slow, hunting, and soft focusing of the lens and resulting blurred and unacceptable images at any ISO, and forget about using live view to focus either manually or on auto. You have to use the viewfinder but that's not such a big deal and I expected that as well as with any DSLR, but not such inferior images in all cases, skin tones off, colors off, super soft edges...nothing looked good right out of the camera hand held or or on a tripod (minor improvement only). 2. the build looks and feels cheap, all plastic flimsy parts...feels exactly like it was made in China by human robots with cheap cost saving parts.My old 35mm Canons (built in Japan with superior sturdy materials) were built like little tanks and were still in excellent to pristine condition after decades of use and this model Canon just can't compare. Even the kit lens felt and looked cheap.The good: fairly easy menu and GUI.The possible good: maybe this camera with a very high end lens would make all the difference in image quality.Next: going to try the Nikon D5100 which supposedly has a better kit lens and superior image quality in all cases.*Please fanbois...don't get upset like you always do when someone posts their own opinion from experience with using a product that you adore and will defend no matter the facts.                    I recently purchased the newest canon t3i camera and lens from this company. I am very pleased in how fast they shipped it, packed it so it wouldn't get damaged, and it was here in less than a week.  I have used my camera a little bit as I am learning how everything works on it.  I love this camera and how the screen moves it takes amazing pictures.  The description he had on it was perfect.  I will definately do busniess with them again                    I like it and its cool. It's fun and takes really good video. It's black and it takes pictures and stuff                    I guess it was my luck to have gotten one of the many faulty cameras out there. A month after i purchased this camera i tried booting it up one morning only to see that my lcd screen said "Error Cannot Read Memory Card Try Formatting" so i formatted my card, and it would still say error. I thought maybe it was just my memory card so i borrowed my friends memory card and still it would give me the same error message. My memory card wasnt the problem because i tried it on a t2i. So now my camera is on its way to get repaired. Its a real shame cause theres a big huge family party coming up and i wanted to take pictures but my stupid T3i had to fail me. Next time im going to go for a Nikon.                    Piece of crap! I've had it for about a year and a half.  Have really not used it that much.  I went to turn it on the morning of my daughter's wedding and no response.  Bought a new battery, still nothing. Apparently it's dead and has to go back to the factory to have the internal fuse checked.  Will never buy a Canon again.                    I got tired of point and  shoots where a tiny movement or shade ruin the photos,and are very slow, especially since I use the camera to photograph my children indoors. Bought this camera, my first SLR, without any knowledge in photography. The camera is user friendly for the automatic mode, but I find that the automatic mode isn't much of an improvement from a regular P&S: colors aren't great, camera is slow to focus, moving kids- pictures far from great. For the cost of 4 good P&S cameras, I would expect MUCH better pictures.  Either I take a course in photography, for which I definitely I don't have time, or take it back to the store, save some money and keep getting mediocre photographs with a cheaper P&S.Another minus- got the lenses that come with the kit 18-55 and 55-250. The 55-250 doesn't shoot people that are close (you get the whole surroundings), but the 15-55 isn't enough zoom. Exchanging lenses in the middle of taking photographs- not doable (then you miss the picture you wanted, which was the idea of buying an SLR). Have to get some lens that covers more (such as 18-200). I understand now that if you want good photos, you really have to get into it, not for everybody.
!###I am a professional still life photographer and this is my family snapshot camera.  Nice feature set and quality for the price.  But I would definitely recommend getting it without the kit lens and buying something like a 28-70mm f2.8 to use with it.                    I love the easy to use basic guidelines and am looking forward to educating myself to it's further attributes.  Wonderful prints from recent visit to botanical gardens.  Lens are easy to change, love all the automatic features.  GOOD OLD CANON RELIABILTY!                    a surprise christmas presnt from my husband along with the super zoom lense - the zoom lense i am using alot. i am finding the camera easy to use - the rapid fire is really fun.also received slr for dummies along with the camera i would recommend this to for a beginner like me. very happy !                    This Rebel T3i is amazing especially for beginners. It's relatively cheap for the quality that you get out of it. My passion for photography was always with me from a young age but I only recently really got into it. I bought this camera in future shop downtown Toronto last year December. The body is made of plastic and if it gets lightly scratched or nicked rubbing the area with your finger removes the scratch. I was blown away by the quality of the pictures this camera provided me with. It was my first DSLR ever. I used to use a Kodak 5MP point and shoot and then moved to my Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc 8MP phone. When I got this camera I dived straight into using manual mode. It is the best way to learn. I live in the Caribbean on an island called Trinidad and Tobago. It's too expensive to ship items out of the country or fix here so I needed to make sure the camera works perfectly. I used this camera in doors and out doors in very cold weather and it held up amazingly. I was a bit skeptical of the Flip screen, living in Trinidad if it broke off or damaged it would be too expensive to repair. (Might as well buy over a new camera body). My fears are no longer, I constantly flip the screen whether it's for video recording of picture taking. It's well designed and built. It is a crop sensor camera which means the lens length is longer. Multiply the 18-55mm standard kit lens by a cropped 1.6 sensor and your lens becomes 28.8-88mm. While it is true most times that the glass (lenses) you buy for your camera are what make the image look amazing because of the optics etc..I have read online many times where people cry down the standard kit lens you get with this. This kit lens is an amazing lens for learning on, so if you're new to photography go ahead and get the lens on the body. If your more of a seasoned photog well you will know to buy the camera body alone and hopefully you already have some prime glass. Checkout some of my pictures on flickr at amazon won't let me paste the link so here is how to see my pictures. In the URL type in [...]  Many of these pictures were taken with the Canon EOS Rebel T3i.Update Wednesday 20th March 2013This Camera Body is the best, I have taken thousands of photos with it already and it's still going strong. Definitely be careful swapping out lenses in any windy area that you know could potentially carry dust, dirt or sand particles that could get into your camera. I took my T3i on the beach last week to get some shots. I got down low enough to get a couple shots but it never touched the sand. However I was swapping out my telephoto lens for my kit lens and some sort of particle got onto the mirror of the camera. I could see it through the viewfinder. Got me scared I tell ya! I was lucky though I was able to blow it out on my own right there at the beach without it going anywhere further inside near the sensor. I got some awesome shots. It rained very lightly so the camera did get a few drops of rainwater on it. Stashed it in my camera bag till I got to shelter and gave it a quick wipe down. Still works. I flip the screen out more than I thought I would, up to now it's still solid as a rock. I only used one battery that day I didn't need to swap another battery in, the camera was on for more than 4 full hours and got around 550 shots that day. I did notice at times of above average use the grip area near the battery compartment did get relatively warm as the battery got hot. When I mean hot I don't mean extremely hot but you can tell the difference. Check out some of my shots on flickrUpdate- Wednesday 4th December 2013Hey Everyone, just giving a quick update. My Canon Rebel T3i will be making a year in about 14 days or so. I am still in love with this camera, even more than on day one actually. I only shoot in Manual Mode and RAW files. This Camera is a BEAST!! Since I last updated my review of this camera I have used it particularly at outdoor,water and powder based events. IN particular Hardcore Caribbean, Water Wars and Kaleidodash Trinidad. Each brought a different challenge. The hand grip area is perfect for holding for long hours. All buttons are still in tact and none are loose. The Flip screen is in perfect condition. 0 scratches and 0% failure. This camera did get soaked down at the cooler party called water wars. I was literally soaked down by a similar hose to those firefighters use. My camera was soaked, all the buttons got wet all the screen. Ended up giving it a quick dry down but seeing as I was soaked as well the camera stayed wet for that entire evening event. At kaleidodash, powders were thrown on me and got onto the camera body, lenses and flash. I tried my best to clean out the crevices of the camera but to this day the coloured powder still remains in between a couple of the buttons and the Canon logo. I used one lens in particular for these events, the 24-105mm F4 L lens which has a small rubber gasket to help fight water from getting in. The flash used for these events was the Young-Nuo YN 560 3.As of today I have clocked 26,155 shutter actuations on this camera in less than a year. The camera is starting to show some signs of wear. The front of the hand grip area of my camera is now slightly pushing out. It could be the sealant is giving way. This could be because of the soaking it got (did shoot in light rain a few times as well) mixed with the constant heat in the Caribbean. My camera screen did flicker once when I put it on but at the time it did this I was using an after market battery. I don't usually record video however i do small tests for my personal use. At times I do find there is a white noise line in the playback of the videos. Not sure what that is. The lens checks out fine. I noticed when I set my camera lens to auto focus in relatively dim light it forever searches for a subject to focus on which is too slow for me. It's faster for me to manually focus and shoot at the night parties. The highest ISO I mostly shoot at is ISO 800 but am noticing a bit of quality degradation.I am looking to upgrade to the Canon 70D for the new year due to the 'better' specs. I need the higher ISO for many of the night events I do. Double the shutter speed is a bonus even though I haven't had the chance to shoot at the T3i's max 4000. The Weather Sealing is much better for the shooting I do. If I had the finances I would have moved directly to the Canon 5D Mark 3. I don't look forward to built in Wifi or Touch screen. Especially having used my cell phones touch screen with a slightly sweaty hand. I won't be putting my T3i down altogether yet though. The T3i will act as a backup of mine when I get the 70D. I have recently met a person who invested all his money in buying a T5i and a backup T4i both brand new with some basic lenses. Had I met them before they bought what they did I would have strongly encouraged them to buy the T3i with one good quality lens and a couple extra batteries. Even though the camera isn't a year old yet and is showing many signs of wear and tear, I would say it held up pretty well towards everything I put it through. Definitely a fantastic camera.Find me on Flickr~Go to Flickr~Then type in a "/" then "photos" then "/" and last type in "suipeter"And that should take you there.                    I did my own research of course and this is a great value for the type of camera.  The photos are brilliant and the smart mode makes picture taking for novices very easy.  Videos are pretty good as well.                    This is everything I have ever wanted in a camera. When this came in the mail it was like Christmas and my birthday all rolled into one. I had originally looked at the T3 but upgraded to the T3i for more features. The T3i also has grips on the camera making it MUCH more comfortable to hold for long periods of time. I was happy that it came with so many different cords to hook up to my various other electronics.The SINGLE downside to this camera is that it has no internal memory. You have to have an SD card in it to use it. But really, that's not big deal. I bought 2. They're really cheap.                    All in perfect conditions. Perfect timing and procut. Thanks! I dont have a memory with me so i can't test it the right way yet, but it seems it's perfect.                    It works just fine.  Just what I wanted.  I do not have any complaints about this camera.  Now I just need to get out and use it.                    great at reducing camera shake a very slow shutter speeds. creates amazing pictures with excellent control of the depth of fields.                    awsome camera. worth every $I got an amazing deal. everything that came with this camera was great. if you want nice camera go with this one
!###Muy satisfecho con esta compra, lleno todas mis expectativas, realmente es lo que estaba buscando desde hac&iacute;a mucho tiempo. Producto recomendado 100%.                    I bought this for my daughter so I can't really give it a very in-depth review only to say that she's very happy with it. I own a T4i which I love and they say a T3i is basically the same minus the touchscreen.                    I love this camera, I recommend it for honestly anyone, like I'm 14 and I love it, I know a junior in highschool that has it and loves it, and I know an adult in her 30's that loves it! Anyone would be happy with it. It's easy to figure out and comes with easy reading directions and tips. It's awesome and the pictures on your camera are easy to upload to your computer, if you're looking for a nice camera, this is the one!                    I am a beginner, and from everything I read on a great starter camera, this has been it and more. I started taking a lot of Portraits and people cant believe they are not professional taken. The quality is amazing. I ould recommend getting a better snap on lense such as the 55mm for portraits but this is a very easy user friendly camera for DSLR. Would buy again                    Amazingly clear, this Canon produces the clearest pictures I've ever seen.  I'm not a professional photographer, but I found the settings easy to control and easily adjusted for any scene.                    The video quality is amazing, only problem is sometimes it automatically stops recording so i had to get a good sd card. If you know what you want from the camera you can get the best pictures.                    I am a videographer, who was looking to move from standard def, and resisted the notion of shooting video with dslrs for some time, eventually after some research i decided to go for it and chose the Rebel T3i because of its features and cost and having seen what could be done with it, i was sold. the delivery time was amazing with my Amazon Prime trial membership and its performance in the first gig i used it for validated my purchase decision, there was no way i would get such beautiful video from  any camcorder in this price range, I'm now looking to invest in glass (a 50mm f1.8 to begin with)  to really get the most out of my new favorite piece of tech, many thanks Amazon !                    This is really more camera than we need just for our toddler around the house, but it is wonderful. Love the quick shutter speed and high quality images. Don't know how we functioned before this!                    This is a great camera, and is amazingly simple to use. This was my first time buying a DSLR. It was for my sister who had no experience using a DSLR before. We used it in manual mode, and were able to use it well after a week of practice.I'd definitely suggesting getting the 18-135 instead of the standard 18-55, even if you get the 55-200 as a separate lens. It is always better to have one lens, and not have to keep interchanging lenses. A great starter lens.I also got a 50mm lens along with the 18-135 for taking portraits.                    The Canon T3i is the perfect "my first camera" for a beginner photographer. Its easy to use interface makes finding and switching settings a breeze.The Canon t3i has an nice amount of weight here you know its not cheaply built but not to the point you want to carry it around. The tilt lcd screen is also a great attention to it letting you shoot from all angle without worrying about if your lined up or not. The only problem i received from  this camera was a battery back that does not charge fully
!###It came really fast and my husband loves it. He use it everywhere we go he takes very good pictures                    So far, I've done little with the camera. It will do so much more than merely take pictures so it will take me some time to become familiar with the many features. I have not had a camera for many years so I am just now getting back into photography.                    It seems to be a very fine camera.It has a steep learning curve.I would recommend it to anyone interested in a good entry level camera prepared to put in some time learning it.                    I purchased various Canon cameras but finally ended with T3i, starting from SX40HS, SX50HS, T3. The fun of manually managing the lens is just beyond comparison. I am currently using the automatic modes and learning to use the manual mode which might take some time but overall a fantastic camera a little heavy with the lens but totally worth it.The T3i essential accessories is definitely needed with this camera.                    The Camera is fantastic and I enjoy it a lot using it. I am still learning the manual for better understanding. I love it very much.                    I was really torn between this and the t2i. I think the pop out screen really is worth the extra price and plus when time comes to sell and upgrade your going to be able to recoup a larger amount than you would with the t2i. Great dslr overall though.                    I'm new with professional cameras but I'm loving this one. I use it the most to take some teeth pictures cause I'm a dentist and the photos are perfect.                    Better than expected. My daughter uses it an loves the pictures and features. A great but and wonderful Christmas present.                    love all the possibilites especially the flip view screen. Better on the neck and back when shooting at low angles. Great manual                    best camera i have ever owed. thank you amazon for the low low price! i switched from Nikon point an shoot cameras, to this Canon DSLR. best decision i ever made.
!###I'm super happy with this camera! Absolutely NOTHING to complain about! I shoot professionally with it and absolutely love it.                    Canon is a great company and they make wonderful camera's and lenses. I have used many DSLR's in the past and this one is great.                    Very nice pictures.  Alot of buttons and features so it will take some time to master all its capabilities.  Wife loves it.                    This is a nice sturdy camera, which fits comfortably in hand while taking shots.  More importantly, it does a phenomenal job with close up and distance shots.  Good choice for serious shutterbugs.                    I was at first set on a T3 but figured why not look at the next step up? I'm glad I went with the T3i because of the rotating LCD that also has a higher resolution. This camera also has the IR sensor to interface with a wireless shutter remote which I'll be purchasing for this camera soon. I love this camera.                    Been wanting to upgrade & did lots of research....so far, I love this camera.  I am just using the basic settings now but look forward to learning more about the many options to choose from.                    I'm just getting into photography and this is just a fantastic camera. Yes, it is a crop sensor so you won't get full frame out of your lens, but overall it's an amazing camera. Just beware, once you start shooting, you'll get addicted and it's an expensive hobby. Although the auto modes are good in a snap, some of my best pictures have come from fiddling around in the manual mode which you just can't beat! If you want to delve into videography, this is an awesome camera as well and can get you that filmic look that you want. I won't profess to be an expert at the t3i (I'm still learning stuff everyday), but the features are intuitive and it's a great camera! BUY IT! There are a few features that really stand out in my mind:- Swivel LCD screen - This is not cheaply made, it's got a nice sturdy feel to it and can be switched into a variety of angles to help you get that perfect shot!- Kit Lens - I've tried the 50mm 1.8, but the kit lens is pretty sweet too. You've got to really have ideal settings to get good footage, but it helps you learn how to use a DSLR- Video mode - It's pretty intuitive and takes great HQ video! I'm impressed!- The camera itself has a nice weight to it! It doesn't feel cheap or fragile (I wouldn't drop it of course).I haven't had the camera long enough and I don't know enough about photography to figure out any of the cons of the camera, but I've got to say, I'm more impressed than I ever thought I'd be. Definitely a great investment. I can't wait to learn more about photography and the t3i.                    I bought an SLR a few years ago as a gift for a relative of mine.  I decided to get one for myself.  I decided that I needed to grow up from the phone camera and get something for special events.I took it outside and used different lenses and tested the different options.  It took great pictures.  I am glad I bought and will continue to test it.                    Even knowing the smallest amount of operating information, I've still gotten some really great shots already! Very simple to use with great results, and that's just a small fraction of this camera's power. I can't wait to learn everything there is to learn (which will take I while by the looks of it, but that's a good thing!) Overall, I'd definitely recommend. I got it fifty bucks cheaper than the current price, so some of you might be wondering why you don't just get the t4i as they're currently the same price - to that I say, if you plan on going up to bigger, professional DSLR's, stick with the t3i because you're going to need to learn the buttons and you might as well start now. If you're a casual user, then I'd go with the t4i, it's minimally better but it IS better, so if you see the touchscreen as an upgrade, might as well get it for the same price.                    This is an incredible upgrade from the digital cameras we had! I've only scratched the surface with the features and I am already impressed.
!###Always wanted a fancy camera... this is a good one I think to start on. Took photography in high school, but never had time to &#34;play&#34; with what I learned. I think this is a good starter model.                    I finally gave in and purchased this camera after years of using point and shoot.  I'm glad I did. It's a very good camera for beginners like me going into dslr photography. I like the lcd display and the instructions on it. I own a canon point and shoot camera and they are quality products, but the pictures from the dslr are way better (night and day) I just started but so far it's been great.  I'm still learning the camera. i would recommend getting the t3i book &#34;From snapshots to great shots&#34; if you purchase this camera.                    This is a great entry level camera.  My girlfriend and I run a small photography business and we use this camera, along with a 60D, and T2i.  This camera is a mix between the T2i and the 60D.  You get the flip out screen like the 60D, but the features/quality are similar to the T2i.Build quality is great.  This is a sturdy camera and it feels good in the hands.  It is also pretty much and lightweight.The best part would have to be the wide selection of lens that Canon has to offer.We also make short wedding trailers with these cameras and the video quality is superb.  You get to shoot in full HD 1080p!For the price that these DSLR cameras are today, you can't go wrong buying one.  I do suggest buying a battery pack and a flash.  These high res videos and pictures will take a toll on the battery.                    I was a little worried to buy something this expensive in the internet but the product came out intact and very well protected. I am very satisfied with it.                    It does what it is supposed to do. It takes great pictures. One problem I had with it. It does not warn you when there is no memory card in it. Missed some awesome shots..                    This camera is the best work great its take great pictures its give you professional looking shots and its pretty easy with this camera, and I highly recommend it to anyone thinking of purchasing an SLR camera i take alot of picture of my kids and they are perfect shots and i am just learning to use the camera                    Great product!!! Super fast delivery!!!  Nice price and quality.I recommend to all. Will enjoy with your friends and family together every day!!!! =)                    New to DSLR, very nice camera. Many options for a new user to play and learn! Features are user friendly just takes some practice!                    It is a very good camera.  My kids are loving taking pictures.  The clarity and speed of the camera is awesome.  We have taken many action shots and the pictures have always come out clear.  Glad we got this camera!                    I was going to buy a SLR because I had a SONY WX9. The WX9 was nice but the photo looks not good in the computer. Because the pixel is 16mp, but the component is small. I did some research before I got this SLR.I compared Canon T3i with Nikon D5100 and D5200. I also compared T2i, T3 and T4i. I found the T3i is the best. You'd better not focus on the pixel. Pixel means nothing. Especially for the new SLR users and the basic SLRs camera. 18MP is much enough for new user like me. Although many people said T3i didn't have many updates from T2i. But I saw many photos from the Flickr which were taken by the T3i. I think the price is nice. I got this camera with the basic lens, 50mm-250mm lens, 16GB Class 10 SD card and an amazon brand camera bag for $690. What a amazing price is. So, if you are a new SLR user like me, and you don't have a lot of money. This one is your chose.
!###This camera was my first DSLR and I love it! The image quality is absolutely phenomenal (love the bokeh). Most importantly of all, is the selection of lenses that Canon offers. There is a lense for any occasion and they will all take phenomenal pictures. There are many great features packed in the camera and the only slight oddity is the video mode. I find it a little superficial and don't like the focussing modes. But other than that, this is a fantastic camera for taking pictures. If you are looking to buy a DSLR camera for the first time... any Canon Txi series will be an excellent choice. Then later, when you've built up your lenses you can switch to a better body if desired.                    Started off with a XSI last summer just to play around with and decided to upgrade to a newer camera. The t3i fit the price right and had  a boat load of new features. One of the things I really like is the flip screen (I know some people hate it), but using it with video is just so useful especially when you are at a concert and have to raise the camera above your head (hey how else are you going to get the shot?!)haha over all , 5 stars! Love this camera                    i tried it out and the first photo i took was AMAZING! and then i took more , same results!!! Dont Bother Reading anymore, JUST GO BUY THE CAMERA!!                    After having point and shoot cameras for the last 10 years I made the leap to a dslr camera. The picture quality is amazing and I'm a complete newbie at it. Being able to take clear pictures of my new baby has been wonderful and I now have been able to capture many moments with this camera that I never would have been able to on my old point and shoot. Everyone in my family has talked about getting a dslr camera after seeing what great pictures it takes. I don't have a frame of reference for this camera over other dslr but I would buy this one again!                    Got this for my wife for Xmas...she's had her eye on it for awhile. I tested it out before and now after that I have given it to her. NO issues or problems whatsoever. Gorgeous photos, smooth, beautiful Full HD video. SO many settings. Love how it can output to RAW for extended editing options with the photos. Just a joy to play with. Even the budding photographer can get some truly excellent results. Very much recommended. Plus that swiveling LCD is just the icing on the cake.                    Great seller, camera arrived early, packaged great and wow canon is as always awesome! The camera was easy to figure out and we are thrilled with the quality!                    Great pictures, easy to use, long battery life. I was between this one and a comparable Nikon (D5100?) and am glad I ended up with the Canon.  As a new comer to the DSLR community I found this camera easy to use and took great pictures, even when I screwed up and had it on the wrong settings.                    This is a real good camera, the fact that has 18 MP allows you to prosperar in the future, in case you want to acquire better lenses. Overall this has allowed me to do a lot. I started as an amateur photographer and now thinking of becoming a pro.                    I would recommend this product to anyone. I really like my camera! It is perfect for taking quality photos especially for my photography class.                    This is my second Canon Digital SLR and I've loved them both. This is by far the best camera in its price class that Canon has produced.
!###Excellent camera that does a lot of stuff.  However, for a beginning photographer it would have been helpful for a quick guide to show me how weverything works.  I been using the trial and error method. :)My friend stated that I should have just purchased the body only and the lens separately.  She stated the kit lens doesn't always do everything you want and you pay about $150 extra for that.                    Love it! I use it for everything and think Cannon is hands down the best. I also own the Cannon D10 and was looking at the D20 when I decided on this one instead. Great camera with great accessories!!                    Fantastic Purchase!  Pictures are great and it is easy to use.  I would absolutely recommend this for any amateur photographer.                    Camera arrived in excellent shape and on time as always.  What can I sayabout this camera that hasn't already been said about the quality, ease ofuse, and picture clarity?  Nothing, all the accolades have been said, andthey are all correct.  Finally, the camera I always wanted.                    as a long time canon shooter this isn't like my first rebel, the tech is so far advaced now and perfect small camera                    This is my first dslr, this feels like a great starter camera with great potential!  The picture quality is better than expected.                    Real nice Camera, the photos are so clear, camera is easy to handle yet so professional. Great Camera for the price                    I'm definitely not a professional photographer but this camera is amazing! You have full control on how you want your pictures and videos to turn out simply by adjusting the lens! I love it. Highly recommend.                    My hubby was thrilled to receive this camera.  He had done lots of research and the Canom came out on top!  We are going on a dream Vacation in a few weeks and are looking forward to some wonderful photos.                    This camera is absolutely great for the price, and for beginning filmmakers such as myself, it proves as a very useful camera. The manual focus is great depending on which lens you use, I use the 18-55 mm and the 55-250 mm lens. The layout is great and the quality is pro-looking! No problems except for the built in mic, but that can be easily fixed with a separate boom mic. No other major cons!

!###I bought this for ny son and daughter-in-law for Christmas and they love it. The pictures are great as are the HD videos.                    I really like this powerful user friendly cam, it is really what i was looking for, great pics, high resolution, great performance, im really satisfied! Thanks Canon                    This is a straight forward basic camera. Very easy to use & customize, and it's fairly light weight. If you take a lot of shots you will want a back up battery as with any camera. I have another Canon which I love, also Nikon & an older Pentax. The T3i is by far my favorite & have been using it solely for two months.                    Great camera.  Easy to use. Takes awesome photos.  Was given as gift to a beginning photographer.  Highly recommend this camera.                    Great buy for an amateur photographer... Camera has easy to use functions, rotating display, affordable lenses and accessories.. I am very happy with the camera!                    Good for armature ! Clear and great photoes. Good and many functions. Easy to handle for newers. Great and not much expensive.                    This is my first DSLR after having 3 digital point and shoots.  It is going to take some time to really appreciate all the capabilities of this camera but so far I am very pleased with the T3i.  In the very basic mode it is an expensive point and shoot that takes great pics but I will get to the level of using the various custom settings to utilize the power of the DSLR as it is meant to be.                    I haven't had the camera very long but it is everything that I hoped it would be.  I am just learning how to use it, but doesn't seem to be too difficult.  Will just take some time.  Pictures are very nice.                    I bought this for my wife who is over the moon with it. The 18-135mm lens is well worth the extra spend, and supprized me with how well it worked in low light conditions.                    Great camera.  Very durable and easy to work. I am slowly working my way up in the camera category.  I loved the picture quality and different features of the camera.  The camera has traveled the world with me and has gone through a lot of punishment and still is a great camera and works great.  Easy to handle and learn how to use.
!###It's my friend's recommandation and it's really good. If the backbag is changed to a normal one for camera it will be better.                    Very easy to use as a point and shoot camera, as I will be taking some classes to really learn how to use more features.                    A great non-professional DLSR camera!Really easy to use (even easier than the Nikon d3100, that a friend have)My first DSLR camera and i am loving it!A must buy for all people that is planning to buy your first DSLR.Good price for a Great product!                    thanks for the black fridayI bought it in low price.As a gifts to my husband . he like it.                    I purchased this camera primarily to use as a video camera for some YouTube projects. The depth of field and clarity of this camera is amazing for the price point, especially if you can't afford the big boys like a Canon 5D Mark II or Mark III. The camera saves the files to an SD card, which is convenient to hook up to your computer (or with the provided USB cord). The video files are easily recognized by Adobe Premiere, and easy to work with.While the kit lens will get the job done, I'm looking forward to getting a &#34;nifty fifty&#34; lens to start doing more video and photo work, and recommend everyone else to do the same.                    This was my very first camera and I love it! It's so easy to use and makes it easy for me to learn how to use it.                    I am so happy with this camera. I'm definitely still a novice but playing with it and exploring has been really fun!I love the screen that rotates.                    Great camera! Would recommend to anyone. Easy to use. Still learning all the features, but still takes great pictures on auto focus.                    My previous camera was a Canon Rebel Xt. When I saw that iPhones had the same MP as me, I thought maybe it was time to upgrade. I had also finally come across enough money to do so.I'm not a 'super pro' but I do like to take some professional looking pictures from time to time. This camera is within your price range if that's the type of photographer you are.                    this is my first SLR camera and the results have been perfect so far.Very easy to use. I didn't  try all the features yet.Image quality has been excellent. if you are used to point and shoot and are planning to buy an SLR this is one i would recommend.
!###So much more advance than my former cameras.  It suits my need perfectly! Hope to try out the 75-300,, f/4-5.6 IIITelephoto Lens, soon.                    Great first time SLR camera.  So far, the results have been outstanding.  Crisp & clear stills, and high definition videos.  Night time pictures are great too.  I Simply love it.                    Love the camera and get great pics. A upgrade from the small cameras. Have many of the lenses and can see the difference.                    Bought this as a gift for my wife. She is very excited and happy with the camera so far. The camera is very easy to use. Purchased it with the 18 to 135 mm lens and very glad we did. Really looking forward to learning how to use all of the features on this camera. Would definitely recommend it for anybody looking for a nice digital SLR camera.                    Does much more than I expected. The only draw back is the flip out screen. Video quality is very good.                    This is one of the best cameras in the market... Also for the price I bought this camera, it's quite a deal.                    I received this camera as an early Christmas present to replace my old Olympus digital SLR. I have to say, I'm extremely happy with it. I've been playing around with it taking some different shots and the results are fantastic! I even tried taking pictures last night when it was dark with the only light coming from my computer monitor and using the flash from the camera. I was totally amazed at the clarity of the pictures.                    I chose this camera because its affordable. Not only it's affordable but has an excellent review from photo experts. Would definitely recommend this product.                    My first DSLR, having replaced a KODAK camera that I killed from taking way too many photos.  With less than 3 days experience, I took some incredible photos in Israel with this camera.  Did phenominal in low light, without flash.Would recommend getting the external flash if you intend to do a lot of low light photography as it will increase quality tenfold.  Regardless, it creates some spectacular photos.  With it being lightweight it was easy to take photos at water level in the Dead Sea.  Be careful if you try that, because the minerals in the Dead Sea can cause damage to the metal.                    I am an amateur photographer who loves to shoot videos and photos of my family. Although I am also hankering to own a full frame camera, someday, at the moment this is what I can afford. I bought this Canon T3i to replace my old Rebel.  I love to shoot video and I wanted to upgrade to 1080P.  I also used to lug both a video and a still camera, now I don't have to.  I don't have to buy new lenses as the 3 lenses I have for the old Rebel are compatible in size.So far I have shot hundreds of videos and thousansd of stills.  I have brought it everywhere from parades, to beaches in Delaware and California, to Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, Shenandoah mountains and to Florida. I usually just bring a monopod for better portability.  I shot indoor videos and stills, in particular, with my daughter's ballet recitals and my kids' school concerts an plays.  Using a long zoom (not with the expensive fast lenses but decent), a monopod and setting it to 1600 ISO, I can shoot hundreds of pictures and get more than a handful of great photos.To shoot videos it is recommended to use faster SD cards.  I am using 16g Transcends class 10 SD cards.  The price of memory cards have fallen so much that I could afford to buy several of them - just under $13 for the class 10 Transcends at the time of this review.  There are a few times when the video recording stops automatically after a few seconds, but usually that is when I  have used the card so many times (record, delete, record, ...etc), I just defragment that SD card and the problem stops.I uses iMovie to process my video clips.  The Canon video format import very easily.Overall, it is an excellent camera to shoot family stills and videos to preserve and record lasting memories.  The size is just right for me, it's not as big and heavy as a full frame camera.
!###I really like this camera - mostly because it's my first DSLR and I really like what it can do.  I did take a basic photography course to teach me how to use it which was highly useful.  If you've had a Canon before, the basic menu and layout are similar to your previous cameras.  This is one of the reasons why I wanted to stick with Canon since I was already familiar with it.  In general it works great and the pictures are good.  Of course a camera is only as good as the photographer and since I am an amateur I can't really comment on all the details like I'm sure others can.I knocked it down one star b/c I've owned it less than a year and I've had to send it back for a repair that I hope is covered by warranty.  The flash isn't working at all in auto mode.  It pops up and fire but the pictures all come out underexposed.  If I manually lower the flash after it pops up, the pictures come out fine.  There's something wrong...just don't know what exactly so they're looking into it for me.  I will come back and update on their customer service once I find out what they're able to do to fix it.ETA:  Got my camera back from Canon in perfect working order.  Since I was still within the one year warranty, I mailed it to them (on my dime but it was only around $12) to be repaired.  The repair was covered under warranty and I now have my camera back!  Yay!  I'm so excited.                    In the Help Forum, a thread was started asking what was going on with customer images: on June 26, Amazon removed them from product pages.  Perhaps that was a dry run because the images were back up on July 10.  But on July 15, Amazon removed all customer-uploaded images from all product pages.  And by August 31, 2013, all images will also be erased from our profile page image galleries.Please see:http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/forums/ref=cm_cd_pg_pg5?ie=UTF8&cdForum=Fx2NFGOONPZEXIP&cdPage=5&cdThread=Tx2YR5LNIBXTE84Several reviewers here have hundreds of images on their profile page.  How many were displayed at the top of this page?  I don't know...I got here too late to see.  But now if we want to compare this $600 camera with another, all we have to go on is the words of other customers and the images of the seller.A picture is worth a thousand words.                    Hey guys, I'm sure if you were as excited about your DSLR purchase as I was, I am not the first review you've read. So let me keep it short and simple.If you're new, this camera with a kit lens is NOT going to disappoint. There's so much to learn on it right off the bat that you will not notice any of the things more experienced photographers might complain about (then again, you're spending way less too!). Excellent pictures. Excellent videos. As one reviewer put it 99% of people looking at your photos are going to see a beautiful picture. The other 1% are professional photographers who are nitpicking things you don't care about or notice.Camera takes brilliant pictures in auto, and even more brilliant pictures once you learn you play around with the settings. If you're trying to decide between this and another camera, do what I did. Write down what you want. Then go watch review videos with a pad and paper. Write pros and cons of each, then see what works best for you. I was comparing to the Nikon D5100 and found that since I want to do more with video, I wanted this for its better manual video and audio controls. While the 5100 has somewhat of a continuous autofocus, many complain that it doesn't give you much control and I find the T3i manual focus a breeze to use in video. Allows you to get more creative too.Anyway, whatever you decide, the Nikon and Canon DSLRs are all great cameras. Write down what you want your camera for, write pros and cons of each camera, quit stressing, order, and start shooting!Good luck!                    Everything is relative when technology is considered. Between different brands you'll see one does something better than the other. In this case, the T3i's direct competitor (Nikon D5100) is a little better with low light performance, but the T3i does video better. D5100 also seems a little more 'newbie' friendly control wise, while the T3i offers ease of access to more advanced functions. Overall though they're almost identical!I could go on all day about how this camera compares to others, but ultimately that is something you should research yourself when you're making an investment such as this! Consider the ergonomics, the interface, what you're going to use it for, your budget - so on.. Find a camera that works for you!With that, I'll continue with some pros/cons. I'm not going to list things that are available on all DSLRs though (mirror lockup, manual control, etc):Pros:- T3i's quality. The body has a high quality, durable feel to it. Nothing really feels cheap on it.- Image quality. Sharp images (sharper yet with a prime lens), good color quality, minimal lens distortion (18-55) with some minor vignetting (nothing that can't easily be fixed in post processing). The picture quality will ultimately be decided by your lens (and your photography skill).- Video. DSLRs aren't really that great with video, but the T3i offers a "sensor crop" zoom function. Basically it'll use a small part of the sensor to record 1080p without skipping pixels on the sensor. This works well for some things but it means you're getting a 3x zoom level so your FOV is going to be very narrow, especially with a telephoto lens. This sensor crop video mode eliminates/minimizes  moire/aliasing issues typically associated with doing video on a big DSLR sensor. There's a whole lot more on this video topic for DSLRs ("Jello" effect, getting the proper shutter speed for the framerate, lighting, lens, etc), more than I can possibly include in this review. Google is your friend when learning DSLR!Cons:- Low light ISO noise.. One thing the D5100 does better than this T3i is low light iso performance. Less noise at higher ISOs. That's not saying this camera can't produce some superb night photography, but you'll be using a tripod to get those results.- Lens quality.. both the 18-55mm and 55-250mm IS II lenses are all-plastic body.. It's hard to imagine lenses that costs hundreds of dollars could feel cheap like this. The focus ring on the 18-55mm lens feels gritty and the inner body of the front lens element wobbles within the lens body. The 55-250mm is better overall, but the focus ring still doesn't feel as smooth as it could. Overall they get the job done (and quite well), but I feel kind of gypped when such an expensive (again, it's all relative) camera has such cheap lenses. You can expect to pay as much as your camera body costs (and more) for some good quality L lenses that don't have these minor setbacks.Neutral points to consider:- This is a crop-sensor camera. What that means is the sensor is 1.6 times smaller than 35mm film. This effectively multiplies your focal length by 1.6. So, with an 18mm lens you're actually getting the field of view of a ~29mm lens on a 35mm film or full-body DSLR camera. The big thing here is that with Canon's "Nifty 50" 50mm lens, the FOV will be like an 80mm lens (narrow and not very useful inside).- Live view. While this can be very handy for getting good framing, autofocus is slow as hell in live view mode. The camera can still function quite well, however.All in all, this review may have been weighted more towards the "Cons", but that's only because it's far easier to address shortcomings than identify things a DSLR does well at in a sea of DSLRs! This camera has everything you need to get great results if you know what you're doing. Overall the camera is superb and the shortcomings aren't remotely close to being dealbreakers. As I said early on in the review, make sure you do your own research and find a camera that works for you!Regardless of what camera you get (assuming this is your first DSLR), get a decent tripod (Amazon has an affordable Dolica Proline tripod that is great), a good 16GB+ Class 10 SDHC card and a DSLR cleaning kit. Other accessories (external flashes, nicer lenses) are quite expensive and things you shouldn't really worry about until you've learned the basics of DSLR photography.                    It takes fabulous pictures and video. Nuff said.But really, this camera does all you ask for and more. It has so many customizable/manual possibilities, you'll never get bored. You'll learn something new about it every time you use it.You'll fall in love with it.The grip feels natural in the hand.I recommend getting the 18-135 mm lenses because 18-55 is sometimes too short and 18-200 is a bit too long. 18-135 is a great walkaround lens so you don't have to carry any awkward camera bag with you.Also, something that might be helpful: The large jpeg is 10.9-11.0 MB. Just if you wondered. 18 MP is a pretty large file size, after all.BUY ITand the flip screen is nice, if you're deciding between this and the t2i.                    I bought this camera and it is my first SLR.  Always being interested in photography and being somewhat creative I thought that the point-to-shoot area has come to an end.  However, it is of course not a cheap investment - especially when you buy the T3i with the 18-135mm lens.  So you are perhaps wondering - was it worth the money?  And the answer is yes!  Even without getting to creative and playing with the variety of manual settings you can make photos in the auto-modes that will make your point-to-shoot camera photos look like photos taken with a cell phone.  The colors and focus on specific objects give the photos more dynamics.  The different modes allow you to select the right auto-setting for the object you are trying to capture.  The screen info on the T3i helps compared to the T2i (my dad has one) when you are new to such camera.  Overall I am very satisfied.  If you are considering to purchase the T3i, then you should think about getting the 18-135mm lens compared to the 18-55mm lens.  Reason being that the 135mm lens gives you more tele and you can zoom more than with the 55mm introduction lens.  If you are planning to get a tele-lens anyway and want to go higher up (i.e. 300mm), then the 55mm should do it.  However, I know myself and do not want to necessarily change lens depending on the distance of the object and the 135mm seems to be the right fit.                    I was having a tough time chosing a camera since im not a pro i was almost sold on a cheaper camera however i knew i was making an investment so I went with this one. I was very happy to find out that the camera was very easy to use and there was very little learning curve. Granted the longer I used the camera the better I became. It was the most fun i have ever had with a camera. If you can spend the $ I highly recommend this.                    Purchased this camera for my wife who wants to get into photography.The camera is very easy to use and takes amazing pictures even with automatic mode.This can be a manual camera or you really can use it as a point and shoot.The camera is lightweight and is fun to use other lenses.Highly recommendedAmazon shipping is the best alsothanks                    Amazing camera, I was between the T3i and the T3. The difference was about $100 (the T3i was on sale) and the flip out LCD and increased resolution were well worth it. I take it out at night for photographs of the stars and the 18MP vs. 12.2MP is a noticable difference. I also photograph airplanes and so it helps to have that little bit of increased resolution when I blow those photos up to poster size. If you are only wanting a camera for head shots in a stuido or close up shots of yourself and other people; for a tourist camera, then I would go with the T3 or even the T2, but if you do landscape photography this is the only option. Get a fish eye lens and you will have the best photos of expansive landscapes. I take mine hiking, camping and bouldering.  Definitely invest in a UV filter protector though; it's only about $7, but it has saved my $500 lens from being cracked and is really durable. Tiffen makes a great one 58mm fits for the T3i. Also, if you go hiking, get a camera bag, a back pack case works best because it doesn't swing around and hit things as you walk or climb and you can put other accessories and snacks or drinks in the bag.                    I am in LOVE with my new Canon EOS Rebel T3i.  I was stuck between canon and nikon for a while, but in the end I went with canon simply because I liked the feel of it better.  Anyway, I'm in college studying photography and this camera was actually way more than I even needed.  They recommended at least a canon t3 but I wanted to get a better one so I could start some freelancing a little here and there.  It takes amazing pictures, but remember...you can get the nicest camera on the market, but it doesn't mean you'll get amazing pictures because of the camera's quality.  It's the PHOTOGRAPHER who makes it happen. :)
!###love my new camera.it was just what I wanted.Thank you very much for the fast shipment. I will have a great time with it on Christmas morning.                    My wife wanted a camera like this for a while so I broke down and surprised her with this.  She loves it.  It takes great pictures, fast compared to our old point and shot, takes a little getting used to looking through the viewfinder instead of on the screen.  Looking forward to buying some other lenses to be able to shoot different distances.  I bought this based on recommendations about great pictures and easy to use because we will not be getting into serious photography and could use this easily right away.  Still a lot to read about and learn but so far its been great.                    I shot commercial events and weddings with three of these cameras, and every time people see my portfolio, they think I use 5Ds. It's not about the camera sometimes, it's about how it's used to it's full abilities! My 5DIII works with better iso for video recording and has onboard headphone jack. Other than that, these things pack quite the punch!                    The depth of color on this camera and the features - especially the swiveling display is a really useful feature.                    For the longest time my wife and I have wanted to buy a nice DSLR camera but for the price we never got around to it.  This holiday we decided it was time to stop putting it off and we dove in.  We received the camera and immediately went out to start testing it and were very presently surprised.  The arguments that the picture quality is not good enough to justify the price increase from your run of the mill 180$ camera are easily squashed when you see what this camera can do.  It takes a bit of reading on the functionality of the camera before you can really get the best of it, but simply on the preset and automatic settings you can tell the difference.  The camera consistently gives great pictures and for a mid range DSLR camera I would defiantly recommend it.  A sturdy or manageable case is recommended as the size of cameras like this makes it more likely to be damaged if you are just carrying it around unprotected.  If you are on the fence about taking the leap into DLSR cameras you won't be disappointed with this one.                    Oh I love my Camera!  It is awesome!  Makes wonderful photos and great memories!  I have always wanted a Canon and now I have it!  Very impressed with my photo's!  Also fast delivery!  Thank you!                    Need more details of what comes in the box. It didn't mention that a charger is included. Not a big deal, but now, I have two chargers.                    I got a very good deal on this camera and bought it for my husband's 20th anniversary gift. He loved it. The lens on it isnt the best especially for close ups but it was a very good buy and the camera is super nice! Glad I bought it.                    Actually the camera is my son's purchase.  He enjoys it a lot and has been experimenting all the manual features (e.g., manual adjustment of saturation, etc.).  The photos he showed me look great.  The protected LCD screen is nice feature.                    For a beginner who aspires to &#34;grow into it&#34;, I found this camera idea. I didn't buy the kit lens. Got the body and practice on a nifty fifty. Most of my pictures are indoor potrait shots and are great!
!###All i can say is wow, clear amazing crisp images. Very user friendly. I have been waiting quite sometime to purchase a canon SLR and i am so happy i purchased the T3i. plus the price was excellent this holiday season. I can't set it down!!!                    We have had the camera for a few weeks and absolutely love it. I especially like the ability to wean yourself off of automatic mode and, as you learn more about lighting, aperture, shutter speed, etc..., move on to manual mode. It is a great camera for learning and takes great pictures in any mode.                    VERY HAPPY!! excelent Camera!! fantastic!!Ha sido un gran regalo!  CANON T3IUna compra realizada en CAMETA CAMERA!! THANKSBLACK FRIDAY, THANKS!Caracas-Venezuela                    A great camera.  This was purchased as a gift and they love it.  Takes excellent pictures.  This is not for a beginner, the person should have some experience with cameras.                    This camera is awesome. I am just jumping into the DSLR world and had my heart set on the Canon EOS M because I wanted small.After reading the reviews of the EOS M, I decided I would go with the tried and true. I am thrilled that I did! Yes, it is bigger, but it is certainly no heaver than any woman's purse!! So, move the purse to the other arm and pick up the camera...it's worth it!                    Easy to use. Love that the LCD screen flips in all directions. Takes excellent sports shots. I use it to take pics of my cheerleaders doing jumps.                    This was an upgrade from the Canon XS and I just have to say that it is worth it by far! Thanks!                    This was a gift for someone that already had the lens  so the basic camera was perfect! She loves it!                    I upgraded recently from a T1i and this can do all that the other could, but more! I'm sure once I learn all the extra features, I'll love it even more than my other camera!                    I decided to step up from pocket-friendly digital cameras to the Canon EOS Rebel T3i, and I'm glad I did.  This is a great camera for the beginner, but it also has an incredible number of intuitive features.  It has made me want to learn more about photography.  I love this camera.
!###Fast and realiable. It has all I need. The screen faciltates to take pictures in inconfortable conditions. Easy to operate; you don't  need to be an expert.                    I had a canon before this camera and loved it. It never failed me and this camera is so far living up to all my expectations. Simple to learn for the beginner and lots of options for the advanced amatuer. And most importantly, beautiful & amazing pictures every time. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!                    nice. a good camera. it worty to bought.all thing is worked well. but what you need to do is extra bought a UV and SDcard.                    I've tried others and am always confused by the menus... although could just be what you're used to.This camera has been great though. Even though it's an older model it does everything I need and then some. The upgraded ISO and DIGIC is a nice step up from my previous Rebel. A great full featured but reasonably priced DSLR.                    Excelent camera. I used it for about a week, testing all features, and it's a good choice for a mid-level photo camera.Everything was exactly as promised.                    I purchased this camera with the intent to get into photography as a hobby and I couldn't be happier! To be honest I wish that I had waited until the new T4i had been released so it would have been cheaper but still it was a great investment. It is very user friendly and produces great photographs. I have all macs and I was little worried that it wouldn't work that well with my computers but it works great! I highly recommend this!                    I haven't used this camera for photography beyond basic curiosity, but I just recently was cinematographer on a full length independent movie and we shot on this. I can tell you that it gives beautiful results. Pair it up with a nice 50mm manual lens and a wide angle and you'll get gorgeous images 1080p. The colors really pop and the ISO levels are pretty sturdy until you get way too high. If you know how to use it (or learn how to use it, there are great websites out there)There are a couple of things that might be a problem, but if you are aware of them I can't imagine them being an issue. Firstly, it doesn't output to a monitor in full HD, so you're better of getting a cheap lcd viewfinder or magnifier to see more details. Second, It will only record clips that are 12 minutes in length, which really shouldn't be a problem unless you're trying to remake Touch of Evil. Lastly, the camera did start to overheat and shut down on me once, but it was out in the sun all day and I did get a warning on the screen. The camera worked fine after a little rest, however.So don't do super long takes, don't leave it in the sun, and don't use a monitor, and this baby is good to go. For DSLR filmmakers, this is the best camera you can get on a budget. You'll love it.                    Just got this camera last week and so far loving it. It takes amazing photos and is very light weight. Im still trying to figure out some of the features and functions of the camera but so far its pretty user friendly! Overall great camera for the price!                    Exelent product, more tan I expected, it comes with all the manuals and cables. I have red some reviews but the camera is better than what most of the people said                    I have had the camera about two weeks, and am satisfied. I am currently learning how to use it. But I am so impressed with how well lit my photos are with the kit lens and only natural light coming in through my windows without the flash. I will update this review later if I find any problems, and to better explain how well I like it after learning more in manual mode.
!###The camera arrived ahead of the scheduled delivery date and was in excellent condition. I have only had the camera for a few months so I have not had the opportunity to really get a feel for what the camera can do.  As a beginner, I am looking forward to using it more as I become more aware of what photo ops I will have.  Great buy and once again great service.                    Nice camera with lot of functions. Works for who knows about photography and also for amateurs in automatic mode. Highly recommend it.                    This is my first dslr. Starting getting into photography. After messing around with my canon sx30is other settings, i was hooked. Ordered this kit along with canon 50mm 1.8. Shipped was quick if you have the prime account. Being new to dslr this camera is ideal for ppl who are making the upgrade from point and shoot camera. Menus easy to navigate and very simple layout. I havent used the 18-135 yet cause i was hooked on the 50mm lens. I highly recommend purchasing the kit w/ 50mm. Its a great start for beginners.                    Excellent item, a great experience in my first photografy course. The price is fine but it should be sold with its case included                    This Camera is really awesome! True high definition quality for the pictures, powerful lens and many shooting modes! Perfect for night shots.                    Just recently recieved this camera and so far I am enjoying it. I toyed with its Nikon couterpart in store and this one if definately user friendly, atleast for the beginners. Picture are amazing. If you are invensting in dslr, I also suggest buying atleast one prime lens to see its majic at budget cost.                    The camera is way above the excelent. The automatic function works like a charm. I am really impressed with it.                    Kind of a must have for anyone looking to get into photography and videography. It's a great product for the price with tons of features. However, with the T4i out, I would recommend getting that. If you can find a great price on a used T3i, maybe, but I'd get a T4i.                    This camera is outstanding. I really appreicate the extra effort the vendor took to help me make sure this camera was the right one for me.  He also took the extra effort to ensure I received in time for my vacation.  I would highly recommend this vendor.                    Love the quality of the camera and the pictures it takes. It is confusing for a novice but easy to pick up once you start using it more. Im not liking the zoom on the lens it came with it shows like its focusing close but when you take the photo it is small. guess i will have to buy more lenses, overall I would recommend the camera
!###Awesome product! Will take me quite some time to fully learn to use the features but am looking forward the experience!                    This is my first Canon camera and I am in love!  The camera is easy to work on auto while I work my way through the manual to find out how to be more creative.  So excited to take tons of photos!                    I am writing this review after using it for 6 months.Excellent camera with great features.Working absolutely fine without any issues.Would certainly suggest this camera for all great photos.Slightly on heavier side. Would not be comfortable if your involved in fast moving sports and entertainment [ Kayaking, Water sports,....]                    Awesome Camera, Good one - as described, it has loads of features, getting to know each one of them might take ages no complains at all, excellent cam and awesome features.                    This camera is a ideal for amateur professional photographers who want to capture both stills and video photography. Its swirl LCD panel allows one to shoot videos of oneself and is very convenient. Plus the pre-defined configurations allow one to experiment with different modes without having to set them manually.The body only allows you to choose the lens that is not available as part of the standard kit. I chose the Canon EF-S 18-200 IS to provide a wide range shooting as well as optical zoom.If someone wants the convenience of point and shoot and at the same time the clarity of a DSLR then this is the one.                    I am still learning the camera but it is nice so far. I have owned many Nikon cameras including 35mm SLRs. This is my first Canon and I had my reservations. I plan to use it for astrophotography and there is a lot of support for the Canons so I went with the flow.The 18-135 lens "feels" cheaply made. The focus ring is very loose. It does work though and I have taken some nice test shots.The camera is loaded with features but some are not that intuitive. I do read the manuals and about half-way through this one. The instructions are good. I will probably use this mostly in Manual mode but the other options are good.Access the memory card is nice. You can get to it with the camera on a tripod. The battery cannot be removed without taking the camera off the tripod.The kit includes a video cable and USB cable. I have not used them yet.The LCD is easy to read and the articulated feature makes it easy to see regardless of the position on the tripod.                    This is the first DSLR I got.I will not tell you how this is the best since I only played with the Nikon D3100. I liked this one best. They were on the same price range (Nikon being a bit cheaper) but this one just felt right (Menus, weight, the ergonomics- buttons, dials).I had it for two months and I love it each day more. I also considered the 60D and the 7D but for the money and features I wanted this as an entry point into DSLR photography.So, I liked it so much I got one for my wife :)Next stop depending on what comes out will be a full frame camera.You can see some sample shots at stefansip.wordpress.comI got the 50 mm 1.8 and the 75-300 no IS no USM cheapo lens that came as part of the kit (not so happy about the last one)The most popular review for the T3i here at amazon is actually an article you can find on the web by google-ing any of the text.                    Was looking for an dSLR camera to purchase before my trip to Germany. This camera came highly recommended. I was torn between the T2i and this T3i. The main difference seemed to be the swivel screen. Luckily I found a good deal online for the T3i and am pretty happy i went with it. I am a tall guy (6'3") and the swivel screen is perfect for positioning the camera down and around in positions to get the best shot. Also, im paranoid about scratches on it so it is great to swivel it and snap in inwards to protect the screen.The picture quality is amazing. The pictures i got on the "no flash" setting at sunset and nighttime in downtown Frankfurt will probably stick with me forever. The video is also rather easy to use and provides some good quality. Just need to focus as you go at times. I am a novice to put it lightly when it comes to photography so have not really tried too much with the more manual settings on the camera, but for all you novices out there looking for a quality dSLR to start out I would recommend this camera. Good quality photos, provided quick snaps and series on the right setting, and the canon software included is super easy and quick to use.                    This camera captures a beautiful video image. The 18-55mm kit lenses is adequate to get started with and can achieve that cinematic shallow depth of field look. Just take a look at this short documentary I shot using this camera to see how it performs [...]                    I have only had the T3i for a week but it is an amazing camera. It does everything I want plus more. The quality of the pics and video is amazing. There are unlimited features in which to utilize this great instrument in like HD video with internal/external audio, camera able to use both internal/external flash, sports mode, or just point and shoot auto. I got the 18-135mm kit lens with mine because I just wanted the ease of having a one size fits all scenarios lens. The lens does great under any circumstance you desire to shoot or film. I am not a professional photographer but have been a amateur hack for over 30 years and this is by far the best camera I have ever owned. The technology put into this camera makes amateur pics look very professional. The buttons, menus and info functions are actually simple to navigate and program after reading the manual and testing a few times. I love the LCD and how it can be opened and positioned. You won't go wrong choosing the T3i or the 18-135mm lens.
!###With this camera I have the opportunity to get better resolution memories I have left of my travels and family events                    This is a very good dslr camera for a beginner. All the functions work very well. I bought a EF 17-40mm lens with it. Until now, it work very well and I took a lot of beautiful pictures.                    This is my first real camera! Before this I used disposable film camera and my webcam! LOL! :)PI bought this because I'm taking a photography class and I wanted the best possible camera.It was very expensive for me so I had to get a loan from my grandma but I'm glad I did!I absolutely LOVE this camera! The shots I've gotten are spectacular!Definitely worth the money!                    Just got this camera as an upgrade from my old Rebel XS.  Mainly got this camera to take pictures/videos of my new puppy.  It is an Alaskan Klee Kai for those of you who care.  The video quality is superb and the settings are very easy to use.  I'm not pro but my pictures are coming out wonderful.  The menu system is easy to understand and simple to teach someone who knows nothing about cameras.  Overall I am VERY happy with this purchase.  Maybe someday I'll be good enough to warrant getting a full sensor camera.                    This is my first DSLR Camera and I think I've made very good choice. The more I use the more I like this!!! Even though I like it very much, I have two problems using this camera. Shooting movies and taking pictures using LCD monitor are really bothering me now because I cannot make right Auto focusing with these two performances. Somebody can help me if you can.                    I love my new camera! It has a lot of feature, but its easy to use. Im just a mom that loves to take picture and this is the way to go. I've had Canon products before and I love it.                    I used to have Canon cameras before the digital age, then went from Olympus digital to Nikon or Fuji for digital.It feels great to be back to Canons and have a quality digital camera.  It has all the features I wanted for close-ups/macro, indoor and outdoor photo, SLR.  And the price on Amazon was really attractive!  I am very happy with my new acquisition.                    This is my first time using a dslr camera, however it makes it a lot easier when you have a camera that helps along the way.. I would also suggest a training dvd or book though.  The instruction manual is good however it leaves a lot to be desired.  Other than that I would  buy again with or without the instruction book.                    This product arrived exactly as described in the caption.  Everything was included, I can't believe that it had to be listed in the used section- because it is brand new!  I am very happy with my decision to use this method of purchase and have added it to my shopping list of places to research for the best price.  I haven't had a chance to fully use every function but plan on doing that shortly.                    LLego todo perfectamente embalado y muy rapido. La camara funciona a las mil maravillas. Unas de mis mejores compras. Saludos
!###I purchased this after much consideration between the T2i, the 60D and this, the T3i had the flip out screen for above shot viewing. They all seem to have the exact same sensor, the only difference being the size, mirror actuation speed and image processors. this fit my budget perfectly. I upgraded to this from a Rebel XS, and a major difference was the lightning fast focus speed and the video capability. this is the best camera for the money (in my opinion) HANDS DOWN                    Bought this camera about 4months ago, with no experience with a DSLR. Got some pointers on aperture & shutter speed, and WOW! The pictures are amazing! I now only shoot on the manual setting. Super easy for those of us with even the littlest of experience, and the end result is professional-grade photos! Would highly recommend!                    excellent product, it was how was described. i'm very satisfied with this purchase and i will not doubt to buy something like this again because fulfilled all my expectatives                    Dream camera, I've been saving up for MONTHS for this. SO happy! I bought it used, and it looked new to me! Bought this over the t2i because I'm a filmmaker.                    I am a painter/illustrator who primarily uses a camera for photographing reference (live models, objects, locations) and making images of my artwork. I previously owned a 40D and was very happy with it. There were some back focusing issues but Canon had recalibrated it and it was working great. One day, though, when I was trying to photograph a painting with some very saturated reds, I noticed the camera just couldn't handle this spectrum of colors--they were strangely murky and smeared looking, lacking crisp details. I wondered if perhaps some of the newer cameras could handle reds better.I then looked at the review for the T3i on dpreview. They test all their reviewed cameras at varying ISO's with an elaborate studio still life; the results can be seen at the end of each review on a page called "Studio scene comparison (RAW)". You can view the images at full resolution and compare sections shot with many different cameras. There are several small bright red fuzzy balls in the still life that are excellent measures for red. I noticed with interest that most cameras (including the 1D!) did not capture the reds well--they had the same murkiness that I noticed with my 40D. There were, however, a few notable exceptions, including Canon's T3i, 60D and 5D Mark II; and Nikon's D3. The red fuzzy balls shot with these had well-defined, clear details, without the problems other cameras suffered from. The 60D, unfortunately, had an orange cast in its reds, leaving the T3i the undisputed winner among lower priced models. Please note: most reviews claim that all the Canon 18 mp cameras have the same sensor--this comparison seems to indicate that they have redesigned or tweaked it for these most recent models.I purchased the T3i and, because of past problems, carefully tested its focusing accuracy. I ended up exchanging the first one because it seemed a bit sluggish, although it was accurate. This was a big mistake! The second one was accurate in the outside points, but back focused in the center point. I exchanged this one and ended up with one that had an accurate center point but back focused with the outside points! This is a fairly minor problem--it's off by about 1/8". Targeted details are on the edge of the zone of sharpness rather than the center, and it's only noticeable in critical close-up shots with the aperture wide open. Still, it could be a problem for portrait and macro shots. I kept it but may send it in to be calibrated.Aside from this, it's a great camera. Beautiful, detailed images, great dynamic range, and the extra resolution gives me room to crop. The high ISO image quality is infinitely superior to the 40D.I also enjoy playing with the video function, with one disappointment: the digital zoom starts at a 3X magnification and goes up to 10X. That means you cannot shoot without any magnification when the camera is switched to digital zoom, a limitation which demands considerable room to back up from your subject. I don't know why Canon designed the zoom like this; it renders a potentially wonderful feature almost useless in an average indoor setting.                    Excellent Camera, great to hold in hand and handle. Light weight to carry around. Provides plenty of features that you can try and learn. Overall, great for learning the concepts of SLR at an reasonable price.                    I love this camera.  It takes wonderful pictures with good high ISO performance.  It feels good in the hands and with a battery grip it balances with bigger lenses well.  It has almost all the features of the 60D minus the bigger viewfinder, faster shooting rate, and extra cross type focus points.  I would make sure the smaller size of this camera fits your hand well.  If it is too small then you might as well get the 60D instead of this version, but if you like the feel then save some money and get the T3i.                    I am a "hobby" photographer, so I hope that you consider this point when you read this review;As a Canon user for almost 20 years, I'm never disappointed any Canon products I've used. I bought this EOS T3i after using my EOS 350D for 7 years.  Although this camera shares the same base with 350 D, it has some critical "update" that I find important; - T3i sensor works definitely fine and 18mp image quality is quite successful. I had a chance to try 60D before and I can say that image quality of the picture taken by these two cameras are almost same. If you support with good lenses, you can have high quality images with T3i body. - The movable LCD screen is far my favorite. It gives a pleasure when you use the camera. In fact I feel like I  am playing a new toy. - The IS system on lenses works fine. I have several picture taken in low light, but they are quite sharp.Other than that, it is a very great DSLR...I have not try the video option but I am sure it gives satisfying results.                    I love the T3i.  It produces good quality images; even in low light, the image noise is not horrible.  The rotating LCD protects the screen, but is still convenient to flip out quickly when needed.  The menu is easy to navigate, I have always been able to find everything I need within a few seconds.  So far, it has been a very user-friendly camera in basically every way.The kit lens is great for the price.  If you are looking for a good beginner camera and plan on buying 2 or 3 lenses to start with, then I would recommend it.  Being a beginner myself, I was looking for one lens to use for several weeks before buying another.  The lens is great and performs exactly as described, but I soon felt very limited as far as aperture goes.  To other beginners looking for a single lens, I might recommend the 50mm f/1.8.  Otherwise, this lens has been great to have on hand and I have learned a lot using it.This camera/lens is by far one of the best investments I have made!                    Camera arrived before time and has proved to be a great piece of kit.  Image quality is outstanding and features and operation are faultless.  A good buy.
!###I shot some pretty impressive music videos on this camera. It doubles in value, when you are able to make your money back by doing professional work with this camera. I definitely recommend this camera to all. Make sure you upgrade to Magic Lantern so you can really unlock the full potential of this amazing camera.                    This is a great camera and I'm very happy with my purchase. The only thing I would do differently is that I would have just bought the body and then purchased a better lens. The kit lens the T3i comes with (EF-S 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 IS) is fine for a while but if you take a lot of pictures you might notice that it can give you soft pictures at the telephoto end. Especially if you have the lens wide open. Stopping it down does help a little. If your pictures will mostly be taken using the wide angle range with the lens not wide open then you might not notice many issues.                    This is my first DSLR and I am so happy I purchased this camera. Their is so many advantages this camera offers and the pictures are sharp and lively. I am working on getting more lenses but I am on my way.                    This camara amazes me on all characteristics, it's our first camara of this sort before we would use a little handheld camara. You always think it's too difficult to get to learn how to use these, but it's in fact quite simple, although you have to take it step by step. We're halfway in trying out all possibilities and enjoy working with it a lot. Great buy, magnificient price quality relation!                    The initial learning curve is fairly steep for a beginner. However, once that is achieved--or if the user is even moderately acquainted with digital cameras--usage become intuitive. I am astounded by the variety of "tweeks" available in each shooting mode. I suggest using the basic modes until familiar with the buttons, then dive in head first! Of course, ALWAYS check the histogram after shooting. This is classified as an entry level camera. I suppose that keeps the cost down ($700 is down?) but who could ask for anything more?                    I am very happy with this camera. It is my first HD camera and my first still shot camera. It shoots images at 4k resolution and video at 1080p. I am an amateur filmmaker and this camera is working wonders for my short films. It takes getting used to to get excellent video but it is more than capable of doing so.                    The product is fantastic. I had another Canon Reflex, but this ona is realy different: The colors are more highlighted, and with 18 mega pixels I can take really good photos. And the seller did all right, i recommend the seller for any purchase.Tank you!                    Purchased the Canon EOS Rebel T3i camera for my daughter. She has just started using it and is wowed by it. She says the picture is actually better than real life. Received from Amazon very well packaged and fast. Hope to have many years of fabulous picture taking.                    Very nice camera with great features.  My wife takes many photos of the kids and nature.  We replaced an older Cannon digital Rebel.  Great for the money.                    One of the things I like about this camera is that it is light.  A friend purchased another brand and it is heavier and she wishes she had one like my Canon.  I am really enjoying it!
!###Hi, I got this camera for my own Christmas present.  I wanted to upgrade my camera but I wanted a Canon, because of the movable LCD monitor.  Its very confusing with all the buttons but I love it.  Pictures come out great.  I still have a lot to learn. Just keep on practicing.                    This is exactly what I was hoping digital photography would be. Well it hasn't been until recently and even then it came at a huge price. NOW this camera is everything I've hoped for. Really good automatic pictures with the built in flash, Excellent shots with the different auto / manual settings. The wireless flash control with the speed light flashes is incredible. Its my Canon AE-1 with A-1 features only without the extra charges for high speed film etc. In short, I love it. Battery life is excellent too. If you liked the AE-1 you'll love this!                    Easy to use, took great pictures. Much better picture quality than the T1i which I gave to my kid. Video auto focus is not as good as traditional video camera. So video sometime is out of focus even it look clear in small screen.                    I received this camera as a gift from my parents. Though I am not a pro, I love how this camera works! Great pictures, great features, 18 MP! It's easy to use, great for carrying with you everytime and everywhere!                    This is my first dslr camera. I'm loving it.It has exciting features and countless possibilities.If you can afford it, go for it                    Purchased for my daughters photo class. She was taking great pictures within minutes of opening the box. Easy to use. Picture quality it great. Would definately recommend it.                    This is a wonderful, easy to use camera camera. I personally hate reading instructions and with this camera I didn't really need to. All of the functions are either clearly labeled or are easy to figure out, so far I have only had to look up one item in the manual. I have used a Rebel XT in the past and the T3i is a vast improvement. Also, Amazon sold this camera for $100-$200 less than anywhere else I looked. Very pleased customer.                    This is an awesome camera. It has lots of features that you can learn and grow into. I love the rotating screen and feel that it is worth the extra money.                    I have had a number of digital cameras, including a very good Canon that let me control everything manually if I wanted.  This Canon SLR is SO much better - faster, better pictures, and it's easy to use.  I have never had any camera that took portraits that I liked using the on camera flash or a flash attached to the hotshoe, including my film SLR.  This Canon T3i DOES!!  I love this camera!                    A great camera.  Just what I was looking for.  I love the flippable screen and ability to shoot photos as quick as you like.
!###It's simply great! It's easy to make high quality pictures with it and it performs admirably in low light without the flash. The kit lens is good enough but I will soon be going for a 50mm prime lens to make the most out of the camera. The flip LCD screen is a real plus.                    i have been working with this camera over a month. i am very happy with this camera. the picture quality is beyond my excpecations.                    I primarily shoot landscapes and pet portraits. This camera is versatile in all kinds of light quality; I am very impressed with what its been able to capture.                    It's all it says on the description. It has a great image in the LCD screen and the video in low light is amazing.                    I just received this t3i SLR this morning along w/ a 55-250 lens. I was actually quite hesitated about this package purchase since it really cost a lot, around 850 dollars in total. But the moment I saw this camera, I so loved in it! It's made of high quality in terms of the material and the details. I took several sample shots. The speed was amazingly fast and with the 55-250 lens I was able to get a quite impressive shallow depth of field. It captures low-light conditions very well.                    I am so in love with my purchased item!The quality of pictures is absolutely amazing! I am very pleased with the night snapshots as this camera makes them look great!It is easy to use but sometimes it wont take a picture when needed as I guess something wrong with the settings. Before using this camera you definitely want to read the instruction book that comes with the item.If you are really interested in photography than YES you MUST have this camera!                    The T3i was part of a bundle that included the camera kit, 2 additional telephoto lenses, printer and UV filter all for a cost equal to the camera kit itself after a $400 rebate.  I received all of the order sooner than expected as I selected free shipping.  The camera mirror was damaged when it arrived and Amazon replaced it with next day delivery allowing me 30 days to return the damaged camera.  I was really impressed with Amazon!  I haven't used the Canon PIXMA Pro9000 Mark II Inkjet Photo Printer yet but the camera with the image stabilization lenses produce really sharp photos.  I could not be happier with this purchase and with the Amazon's fine service.                    This is a giant step up from our Nikon D40, we also sold a Sony A1u (older HDV camcorder) because of the 1080p video functions that the T3i brings. What a great trade off! This delivers great pictures and great video at a quality price.                    Great camera with alot of features to do just about anything. fairly easy to use, lite weight, and takes some great pictures!                    Update: Heads Up, the new Sony NEX-5N is now giving the T3i Canon a powerful contender for less money. Pity there aren't enough lenses for it but that could change soon.The Canon T3i comes with the best lens in the market, far better than the D5100 kit lens. The Nikon kit lens is a soft lens, the Canon kit lens is ultra-sharp and it has a greater depth of field. Also Canon lenses are cheaper.Color reproduction is noticeably better on the T3i. The Nikon camera lacks saturation, specially in the red spectrum. Sunsets look completely wrong on the Nikon, dull and grey instead of yellow and red. However the Nikon D5100 performance in ultra low-light conditions is spectacular, the D5100 noise reduction is impeccable and beats the Canon Rebel by a long shot. This make the Nikon a better choice if you plan to use super-telephotos or shoot at night.The T3i photos look amazing as long as you keep your exposures between ISO 100-800 but the Canon T3i responds poorly at ISO 6400, no just noise but white "hot pixels" ruin the image. Photoshop filters can remove some of the noise but are unable to remove the white pixels successfully and who wants to work that hard anyhow? For this reason I cannot recommend this camera for low-light shooting such as wedding photography (ie. inside a church)Warning to filmmakers: It is not impossible to shoot a movie with the Rebel T3i but it is extremely impractical and I question the sanity of people who would recommend DSLR cameras for movie production. You would be just asking for trouble. Instead, if you must shoot HD video with a still camera for some reason, just buy a Sony TX9 or TX10 for one third of the price, the 1080p video quality is the same and it offers continuous autofocus, oh, and it fits in your pocket, perfect for traveling.
!###I'm using this camera for DSLR film making. I own both the D60 and D600 and this camera wins.-The D60 is far heavier, but the construction is exactly the same (same plastic/rubber). There's no justification for the added weight. Seriously canon, why is it so heavy? It's the same sensor and software.-The larger LCD is useless since you'll be mounting an LCD viewfinder on top anyway.-$300 price is totally not justified. Save the money for lenses or other gear.-The camera can shoot at 5.7fps (vs 3.1 on the D600), only useful for still photographers. Also, it can shoot at 1/8000 vs 1/4000, again, useless for film.I think most people who buy this camera are doing so purely because they believe it looks and feels more professional, they don't really understand it's the same hardware. My advice is either step up to a full frame body, or buy the T3I. The D60 is an odd one in the lineup, not sure what canon was thinking. They're charging 40% more for added weight.When someone talks about shooting film with a D60, I don't think "professional".  I think "you don't really understand your camera."                    Just got off Canon's website. The camera is fine but my lens had some problems with reaching an f-stop of 3.5, it would go no lower than 4.5. This made it a little difficult to shoot in low lit environments. Canon doesn't seem to honor their warranty. I went on their website and everything was fine. They gave me an RMA slip to ship with the lens. I shipped my lens to the factory and received a fix it ticket for about as much as the lens itself. I paid for my shipping expecting some help from Canon with a price tag of $0(RMA price), only to get a response that it will cost me $100. I can buy a new lens for $50 more. Why buy Canon lenses when they do not support their product.The camera works fine, I am pretty happy for the price, especially for video. But I would avoid their products from now on. What if it was my camera that had problems, that may have cost me a 7D.                    I am an amateur photographer. This is my first SLR camera. It takes great pictures even with low light. I haven't had time to check out all of the features yet or read all of the way through the Manuel. I have two other Canon cameras and much of the design is familiar to me. Because of the similarities it was easy for me to pick up the camera and use it right away. I like having the camera with me as I am always looking for great shots!                    I wanted to take pictures of bridges. Since retiring from my days as an outlaw, I have been traveling the American countryside taking photos of bridges. So I needed a great camera to do it. This more than meets my expectations. It is everything you can hope for when producing photos of bridges. One day while looking for a bridge I met a woman named Francesca Johnson. Her husband and children were away at the Illinois state fair. She had become restless and disillusioned with what her life had become after having to make a very difficult choice in her youth when she was known as Sophie. We bonded and proceeded to have a 4 day affair that embodied the true love of our lifetimes. But our paths led to separate lives. Her with her family and mine as a photographer for National Geographic magazine. When I pass away, I hope to have my ashes scattered off Roseman Bridge.-Robert Kincaid                    Good camera.Everything is good except the following:1.Price goes down too quickly.The price of 18-135mm kit was $949 in Nov.,$874 now and lots of free assessaries.2.The rubber around the view finder is easy to be dirty.3.Battery life is not as long as others.4.Video shot needs too much space and no auto focus.After one year, still works really well, nice camera.                    I read quite a lot of the reviews on this product and was filled with much confidence when ordering that this was the camera for me! Unfortunately the auto focus could never, ever focus on anything. I mainly want to use the camera for pictures of my professional cakes and my pets.The images I did manage to get were much lower quality than I was expecting.When trying to photograph my hamsters the focus just kept trying, and trying, and trying, and trying...it could never focus on anything and would miss lots of great shots. When it finally decided to focus everything was blurry. Rubbish.I tried to test the focus using the macro mode, where the instruction booklet tells you to get as close as possible to the subject - I chose to photograph a flower in a vase. The stupid thing could not focus on the flower. I wasn't even able to take one photo. Not one!I'm not expecting the world's best DSLR for this price, but I do expect to actually be able to take photos.                    Err 05 The built-in flash could not be raised. Turn the camera off and on again. This happens every time I try to use the flash. Canon wants me to ship it insured at my cost, and they don't have anyone outside of Virginia to service it under the warranty.                    This is a great camera but it doesn't work all the time. One thing I am complaining about which is a major part of this camera (t3i)is the continuous shooting mode (3.7fps). The camera shoot great for about 5 or 10 minutes of continuous shooting then it slow to less than 1fps. There nothing I can do or change to speed it up. Only after shutting it down for about 20 minutes to cool down will the camera return to normal. Somehow, everyone gives great reviews and no one mentioned about this problem. I am wondering if I got a defective camera.                    I bought this as a Christmas present for my girlfriend. But she broke up with me a week before Christmas but I still gave it to her. I never got to know how she liked it or even see pictures she took with it. I later found out it was stolen after taken a photography class. It was stolen from the car of the guy she was cheating on me with. I guess she dont care cause she was not the one who spent $700 on it and didnt spend on a Christmas present for me anyway. I wish I kept it. It look like a good camera just by holding it. I just wish I could have used it and give a more detailed review.                    I really wanted to like this camera. I really did.When it functioned correctly, it took some very good photos. However, for video; this thing is sadly lacking. For one thing, it would constantly overheat; even when being used in an air conditioned space. It could never record more than 6-8 minutes of 1080 video  without overheating. Attempted to record a school concert, what recordings were obtained; were awful.Images taken, quickly become grainy when the light is anything less than optimum.From my viewpoint, the menu system is too cumbersome. With large hands, it was difficult to hold and use the camera. It was awkward to access the various wheels and buttons.The screen was difficult to view while outside. ANY glare rendered it completely useless. Used inside, you have to shift your head or screen to find the right angle for viewing. Even then it was often hard to read.Barreling was noted in some test images. An image with a flag pole against a bright blue and slightly cloudy sky turned the flagpole  into an arc rather than straight line.The auto focus would function adequately for pictures, but only with absolutely optimum lighting. When you shoot video; you could never get the image crisp using either auto or manual focus. Even when you mange to get the subject crisp, any panning quickly resulted in blurred and/or soft images. If you prefer to shoot video with all in focus, forget about the included 18 - 55 mm lens. It was painful to try and manually focus this lens and of course the auto focus never worked correctly.It's probable the unit tested was defective. But unwilling to risk an exchange, the camera was promptly returned for refund.I've generally had satisfactory experiences with canon products, however; this one failed to meet my needs, expectations and preferences. My advice would be to try before purchasing. This one could quickly turn into an expensive mistake.
!###From the few days I've owned this camera, I can tell you I'm very happy with it. My wife and I wanted to start learning advanced photography and move-up from our point-and-shoot Canon Digital Elph 8900.First we were thinking Nikon, but I can safely say after experimenting with most Nikons that you wouldn't understand half of what the camera can do.Then the salesperson showed us this camera, the T3i. I loved the built in 1080 video, adjustable screen, and most importantly, the fact that Canon has made it extremely easy to use.Each mode has a 1-2 sentence explanation on the screen telling you when you'd want to use that mode. What I also like is that it's not too basic; meaning, you won't outgrow it right away.Granted I've only owned mine for a few days, . . . so far, I can say that you should absolutely strongly consider this model if you're in the same position that my wife & I have found ourselves in.                    I remember the day I bought this awesome machine. I ripped open the packaging and could smell it as I fondled the black body, firm and right for the job. My T3i had arrived and so had I. I was ready to shoot the world!I'm a newbie but I know quality when I feel it, this was one quality beast I was going to tame, nothing was going to stop me before I captured a slithering series of perfect pictures to show off to ME, MYSELF and I! It's mine, my very own and I'm so excited- I can do what I want with this beauty.Stylish, solid and secretive, it holds a presence of its own. Absolutely festooned with features and benefits, my T3i helps me find my way intuitively across the wasteland of photography. All other machines lie in the dust as if to beg for just a glance from me, the master handler, the crowd controller and magician of our time. I have the world at my feet now that my 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR is tethered to my neck. I look down on anything else that can't compete- everything in the world shouting from the shelves to be considered. But no, there's nothing out there to compare with my beautiful girl, she's mine and I'm in love with her!Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 Imaging with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens                    I'd consider myself to be an experienced amateur photographer, having for years shot with SLRs and medium format cameras, but this is my first digital SLR.I've been very pleased with the images and settings available on the T3i. I've been able to get great images shooting in aperture priority mode...and the learning curve was pretty short given my previous experience with both Canon SLRs and high-end digital point and shoots. The T3i has a nice grip, good battery life (but be sure to get yourself a couple extras anyway) and the flip out screen is great when you're shooting product photos on a low tripod, which I do a lot of.My only complaint is relatively slow auto-focusing in live view mode, but it's a minor annoyance.                    This SLR is everything the beginning or experienced camera buff could want.  My husband is thoroughly enjoying his gift.                    I feel I should state that I have been a point and shoot user my whole life, aside from a foray in photo club in high school. That said, I always had higher end point and shoots, and frequently put them in manual mode and such. As such, I am not comparing against competing models or lenses, just on what I see after upgrading from a point and shoot. Anyway...I have had this camera for about a week now and have taken a few thousand shots. I am absolutely blown away by the quality. After using the T3i, I feel like I have never actually owned a camera- all my previous cameras seem like useless toys. The control and ability that this camera gives you allow you to really take your pictures to the next level. I took outdoor action shots of my dog that I wouldn't even have attempted in the past. The colors that popped in my outdoor shots really captured my neighborhood in spring bloom. One somewhat unpleasant surprise is just how much detail was picked up- skin blemishes and dust in my house were all very visible! This camera will allow you to capture moments that you can frame on your wall forever, as opposed to the typical posed portraits that you are generally limted by with point and shoots.I upgraded to the 18-135mm lens, and it takes great shots and never requires you to dance around getting closer to a subject. The lens feels solid, and is not excessively large. I live on a bay, and was able to get nice shots of boats 1/4 -1/2 mile away without a problem. I also picked up the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens for indoor photography. For the $125 price, it is a great deal and takes considerably better indoor shots with lower light.                    The DSLR works great and is of amazing quality! Perfect camera for those starting out with advanced photography or entering the world of DSLRs                    no words for this. Perfect for the novice user.i don;t think there is something wrong with this i saw the review for many other band DSLR camera but all are almost same.easy to operate and use and even give best shot with auto focus and auto intelligence mode.Perfect those who wants to test their photography skill or start career in it.                    Camera arrived as advertised, brand new in box. Absolutely love it, already had a ton of fun with this setup.                    I bought the refurbished version of this to save a few bucks. It arrived on time and looks brand new! Not a mark on it.So far I have not had much time to use the camera, but the few pictures I have taken have been IMPRESSIVE! The speed o ftaking pictures is great. One thing that has always bugged me about digital cameras has been the LAG! I am an old 35mm guy and have been used to being able to turn the camera on and instantly start shooting. This camera comes as close to being able to do that as I have found.                    I really enjoy the quality of the photos. I used this to video my son's wedding and the ease of use and the quality of the video really impressed me. I like how the LED screen swivels and allows me to use the camera without looking at the view finder. I am an amateur photographer and this is not the first Canon DSLR that I've owned. I'm glad I made the upgrade. You can't go wrong buying this camera.
!###Such a great camera for capturing clear and crisp photos. Several settings allow for great options no matter what venue you are shooting. Professional video quality as well.                    I owned old 20D. This camera WAY cheaper and WAY better. I love display, adjustments, quality. I would highly recommend this camera even for those who shoots professionally.                    I am a beginner so this camera is perfect for me. A lot of my friends recommended it and I'm glad i purchased it. It's a little difficult to get started if you're someone like me and know very little about cameras. I eventually got the hang out of it. I knocked off a star because the strap that came with it broken a week or so after I attached it to the camera. I was simply walking and the camera just fell off my shoulder. It hit the ground hard but luckily it only hit the lens cap and it works fine.                    Great product to do it all! It will take care of many pictures and memories! It is ok for us.                    I bought this camera back in December for my trip to Africa and Latin America. This is my first digital SLR as I finally joined the digital club when the my 35MM SLR finally broke (yeah, I'm a bit late). I've used numerous canon products before (Elan, Rebel, SX110, 120), So I'm kinda familar with SLR and digital functions. I decided on the rebel series as a point of entry to the DSLR world due to the price to function ratio being extremely attractive. I needed a full function of an SLR that allows me to attach a long telephoto lense (Sigma 120-400mm - see my other review on this lense) for wildlife. My expectation was in the mid range due to the canon namesake and various functionality (3.7fps, B&W, HD movies and tilting LCD) and compatibility with my older stuff from flim days (70-210 mm and 380EX flash - TTL even works too!).I'm goign to pass on the pros and cons for this camera since most of them has been discussed thoroughly by other reviewers. However, the biggest suprise for me is how robust the camera body is. My camera fell off my backpack while I was galloping on horseback in the mountains of Ecuador and subsequently and after careful inspection, I found that the camera remains fully functional with only cosmetics issues. When it happened I thought that I need to purchase another camera for the rest of my trip as I was quite convience that the fall would have shattered my camera. Just FYI, I was not galloping at full speed and it was on dirt trail, but still I am very impressed by how solid the camera was build to sustain such impact. On the disappointing side, at higher end of the ISO, the performance of the camera definitely is not as good as those higher end like the 6D and up.Bottomline : I would recommend this camera to those who wish to venture into DSLR as price point to performance is very attractive, especially now with newer models of rebels. Also, works with your older equipment from your flim days (if any of you guys are still around). Plus, the robustness of the body definitely deserve a 5 star rating!.DMAN                    My camera arrived exactly when they said it would. The pictures are of a very high quality and I could not ask for a better value for money.                    My dad purchased this for himself.  He loves this camera and uses it in constantly.  Canon SLRs are a superior product.                    I am not a professional photographer and use the camera for car show images, product photos for our website and instructional videos. Will need to learn a little more about aftermarket audio options; however, at this point I am very staisfied with the purchase.                    This is my first semi pro camera and i have to say it take my pictures to another level. I love the resolution and the display. Im still learning about it every day.                    With a name like Canon, you know to expect exceptional quality products.  The EOS Rebel T3i is no exception, it surpassed what I expected from reading other reviews, and is user friendly, and capable of taking the most beautiful images I have seen out of an SLR I had access to.  If you want an exceptional camera, than this is the one for you.
!###I believe this to be a very adequate camera for my purposes.  You get a lot of features and capabilities for the money.                    The canon t3i is amazing everything was just as the seller said. Perfect Sharpe! Arrived on time, soon as I took I out the box put the lens on I was in love after my first shoot :)                    The camera works great! I am very happy with the quality of the camera. It was exactly what I was looking for!                    Great price for a wonderful camera with so many features.The main issue I have with this camera is with the video; autofocus does not work in video.  You could press the shutter button to refocus but that messes up the few seconds of video.  There is also no good way to add a good mic because there is a problem with the automatic gain control so if you use an external mic, you will notice a hiss when there is silence in the recording.So T4i is out now.  This camera will be cheap soon and you should get it but only if video is not that important.                    This was my very first DSLR. I've been interested in photography for some time and finally decided to put down my mega zoom camera and pick up a real camera. I received this camera for Christmas(2012) So currently I've been using it for a good two months. Just comparing this camera to other DSLR's this camera feels very plasticky, and the exterior body will scratch fairly easily, its a tad heavy for how cheap it feels but that could be a good/ bad thing depending on the use.The kit lens (18-55 mm) does a decent job obtaining high resolution images paired with the 18 megapixel sensor.  The swivel screen really isn't a big deal to me and seems more like a gimmick than something people will actually get use out of, since I do not use live view mode very often to frame my shots. Autofocus is horrendous, just warning any first timers out there who are like me and had no clue at the beginning. Using the autofocus in live view mode could possibly be one of the most frustrating things I've ever experienced in my life. This is a good camera for still frame/portraits,and not so much action shots just due to the fact the autofocus sucks.The battery life fairs pretty well for what I use it for(trips to the zoo, the occasional landscape shot, and everyday use) and I find myself charging it once every week or so. That being said people who are far more serious than I about their photography will probably need some sort of 3rd party equipment to help extend the battery life during hardcore continuous use.Though with the few gripes I do have about this camera it really has helped me grow and learn as a beginning photographer. The menus are very easy to navigate and I love creative mode because it helps the beginner to get out of auto mode without losing the extra help auto provides. Canon probably has the widest range of lenses available compared to any other brand. Although I have recently gotten my hands on a NIKON D3200 and I have to say I wish I would have started with that and might possibly be ditching my Canon Rebel t3i soon for it. I can't get over how smooth the autofocus on the D3200 is. I mean if both cameras were like food the D3200 would be like butter, smooth and creamy. The t3i would be like vegetable oil greasy but works for everyday use.                    i actually bought this around 100$ less than it it is in the market for a friend, really neat and beautiful it came with a bunch of accessories and my friend (he's is a photographer) seem to love it so it has to be legit ;)                    I just got this in the mail and, honestly, I haven't even gotten it completely out of the box yet.  I've had a Rebel XT for some years now and decided to upgrade simply because of the new advances in technology and the fact that I know the XT was pretty much bottom-of-the-line.  I'm sure I'll love the T3i just as much as I love my XT.HOWEVER: The first thing I notice while unpacking it is that the battery charger now comes with a CORD!  Really?  This was necessary?  It may not seem like much but for someone who travels, this cord is going to be a pain in the a**.  Why is it that every time manufacturers get something right, they feel it necessary to change it? Usually for the worse.  Perhaps someone can enlighten me.                    We bought this camera about 2 months ago from Canon while all the refurbished cameras were on sale.  I have to say, for what seemed prior to be something complicated, my wife and I were EXTREMELY pleased with the ease of use.  While we certainly don'y stray to far from the "auto" set on the dial, every setting comes with a good description, and the camera is so intuitive when we use it.  The autofocus settings are great and the quality of pictures taken are absolutely INCREDIBLE.  We've been in the market for a DSLR for some time and went with a Canon over a Nikon on the advice of  a friend and I can say that we are EXTREMELY happy with our decision.  For anyone looking for a good starter DSLR, this camera is PERFECT. Capable of professional quality pictures with novice level user knowledge!                    First of all, this is my first DSLR. I've been an amateur enthusiast for years with many point-and-shoot cameras. I've played with this T3I camera for a few weeks now with differing lighting conditions both indoors and out. I've also tested near and far photo shots, with hand held and tripod mounts. I've included filters and telephotos as well. I have not played with any wide angle lenses yet.LENSES USED:  Canon 18-55mm (Image Stabilization)  Canon 75-300mm (Non-Image Stabilization)  Sigma 18-250 Macro (Image stabilization)  Sigma APO 2x DG EX teleconverter  Vivitar UV filters  Precision Design 2x telephoto  Precision Design wide angle 0.45xPHOTO QUALITY:-T3I camera takes nice photos, but while holding camera by hand, there are some hits and misses of blurred images when subjects move. I have tried different settings including the sports setting. I assume this is due to my not getting used to the camera settings yet? When images don't blur, pictures are awesome.-Another of my cameras, point-and-shoot Canon SX260, takes better pictures than the T3I. I set both cameras on the same tripod and take photos of the same objects in daylight, then with multiple other objects at different locations. Different zoom ranges used for each camera. SX260 takes better photos when viewed at same size using Windows Live Photo Gallery. Possibly me not knowing settings on T3I again? Please note SX260 is one of the best point-and-shoot cameras out there.PHOTOGRAPHER'S VIEWPOINT WHILE TAKING PHOTOS:-With many of my point-and-shoot cameras including the Canon SX130IS, when I manually change the exposure (such as trying to lighten a person's face to show in a really bright background) the screen shows the face darker or lighter, and the photos come out lighter or darker accordingly. If I can see the person's face on the screen, I can see the person's face in the photo. With the T3i, the screen doesn't reflect this. I may be able to see the person's face on the screen, but the photo actually comes out too dark or too light depending on how I manually "guessed" at the exposure. It amazes me how a DSLR is inferior to multiple cheapy point-and-shoot cameras. Sure, I can take multiple photos to see which is best (but only in a perfect world will all things stand still for me).VIDEO QUALITY:T3I is my only camera ever with absolutely worthless videos. All my point-and-shoots work fine in video. When subjects move closer or farther from the camera, everything is out of focus except for when the subject coincidentally is in that specific focal point. I have played around with the settings. The best I can do is use the shutter button to reset to a new focal point when the subject moves. Even then, the camera takes a while to lock in to the new focal point, by which time the subject has then moved once more. Perhaps videos might work properly if all subjects stay at infinity focal point eventhough they move? The manual confirms camera is not capable of keeping subject in focus if subject moves.                    I had to return this camera because it came defective; however, that was not the reason why I didn't return it for the same thing.  Canon makes great cameras and I chose them over Nikon after doing exhausting research.  The clarity of the pics were amazing.  The only hard issue I had with this camera was the speed.  If you are looking to take rapid pics, this is not your camera.  This is my first DSLR and even I thought it was slow.  After doing more research I found out that if I paid $40 more, I could get the T4.  Why wouldn't I do that?  The T4 is faster, it has more MPs, it has a touch screen, and it can hold two memory cards.  It has in camera HDR and video autofocus.  Now when it originally came out the price was much higher and the T3 was a better bang for your buck, but ever since the price of the T4 came down, it makes no sense to to get the T3.
!###Camera is awesome with lots of features and the lens that it came with rocks. It comes with software to edit and convert pictures to jpg or other formats. This is a professional camera that allows for many adjustments to pictures prior to converting to jpg or other formats. Software in the included cd must be installed first prior to opening pictures as your computer will not recognize their format.                    This camera is useful already and took several pictures. I just caught the right light when it flash. Worth to buy!                    Great item and reasonable price. Great csr service too. I have purchased this camera for my nephew who is crazy about photograph and video, and this camera suit for both of his needs. Thanks,                    This is a great DSLR camera, but I must admit that I erroneously bought it for achieving a cinematic look to video. I read and heard so much about the wonders of shooting DSLR video that I gave it a try. After using it several times, I realized that the work flow is so challenging and time consuming compared to true video cameras that I sold it and went back to my video camera roots. I picked up a canon XA10 to pair with my HF G10 and I've been totally happy. This is a great camera for still photography, but for video the limitations on clip length, sound, ergonomics, and rolling shutter jello just don't cut it for me.                    I was very nervous about buying something as sensitive as a camera online but I'm so pleased! Everything was absolutely fine. It's SUCH a great camera...now to build my lens collection =)                    I have had this camera for about a month ,am very happy.  Great when on automatic setting.  Still working on different settings since I am new at Photography.  Very good experience taking photos working with all the settings and my next step is to attend classes that will teach me to work with F-stop,speed,aperture setting, etc.  I would advise this camera for a starter since the price is also very reasonable for this great product.  You can't go wrong with Canon products.  I bought the camera through Amazon and again can't go wrong with the wonderful service.                    This DSLR Camera is the best to start with for photography starters. I you really want to dig into the photography world, I recommend you start with this type of DSLR.                    For beginners this camera is a really good option.I'm learning photography techniques with it and the results are great!                    I have been using this camera for a while now and the more I use it the more I like it. I have a couple of other cameras that are much more expensive and do way more stuff, but I enjoy this one the most. It's easy to learn and very user-friendly. Highly Recommended!!                    I bought this item through amazon used "like new" and everything was great BUT, yes BUT, the battery and battery charger were missing. So you wonder why i gave 5 stars? The customer service from amazon was great and they solved my problem in 20 min or less, so i know they can have mistakes but if you buy from amazon you can be sure it will be solved. The camera works awesome and i love everything about it! Enjoy you camera!
!###I got this camera to do short films, and it's a HUGE step up from my previous cameras. My short films are already getting more recognition because of how much more professional they look now. Here's the first project I worked on with this great piece of technology: [...]                    I have never owned a DSLR camera in my life. Never as much even touched one. By following directions from Canon EOS Rebel T3i / 600D: From Snapshots to Great Shots, I was able to learn how to use this wonderful camera. I love it! I will never go back to a point and shoot camera. You will not be sorry when you buy this camera. I've received nothing but great reviews on the pictures I have taken with this camera. I have only owned this camera for 3 weeks. Take a look at my example picture of my daughter up above. Have fun with your Canon EOS Rebel T3i!!!                    Not gonna write a huge, in-depth review, you can find millions of those. I just wanted to make sure this thing got my 5 Stars! Its truly AMAZING!!!!! I am so glad I spent the $.                    This camera is amazing for skateboarding. The pictures and videos are amazing quality. If would want to see the quality go on my youtube channel and subscribe to heshcentral some videos are filmed with this camera                    Just wanted to add something about this camera that I didn't read about or nobody posted onYouTube  about it I bought this camera a week when it came out I first hadCanon xsi  and  that camera had more room for your hands I don't. Know if it's just me that I have. Big hands but it seem kind of small for me My middle finger always leaving the side of the lens all scratched  I don't knowIf someone else. Has the same issue that's the only reason I gave it four stars butThis camera is really nice takes amazing pictures and  video with the 50 1.8 issick with it in other words amazing Just looking to buy the tamron 18-200 can someone tell me how thatIs with this. Camera still undecided  two year old threw my camera and the 50 1.8 broke so need aNew lens                    Camera was as described, packaged not to be damaged in shipping. This camera is all that I would ever need. My pictures are sharp and I can now take those little insects or whatever I so desire. Good camera at a good price. Thanks Amazon.                    I have been determined to get this camera for about two years now and would look at it every time I went to Best Buy.  My dad told me it would be best to get it from Amazon and not Ebay even though I found it cheaper there, and not get it from Best Buy because of the no tax and free shipping with Amazon.  To my advantage, the extra penny's gave me piece of mind and worked in my favor.  It shipped to me quick and was nicely packaged.  Also, if anything went wrong I paid through pay pal and Amazon would refund me my money regardless.  I absolutely LOVE this camera, it not only takes AMAZING pictures but it is relatively easy to use.  I am an aspiring fashion designer and photographer and I believe for this being my first personal camera its a perfect start.                    I bought this camera when there was a promotion. My husband and I love this camera at the first sight. The quality of the photos are great, especially the color. The convertible screen is very useful for saving the battery and avoiding dirty touch.                    This is my first good digital camera. I grew tired of the point-and-shoots poor to mediocre image quality. This camera is absolutely amazing. I couldn't be more pleased. And as I learn more about it, i.e. reading the manual, the better the camera gets. While I don't aspire to become a professional photographer, this camera is going to turn me into a decent photographer. I really doubt that I needed a more expensive camera. At this price point this camera is going to keep me happy for a long time.My only complaint is the user manual. It was translated into English...there are some curious and confusing sentences from time to time. The index is not complete. The overall layout of the manual could be better. But it's passable.                    The interface of this camera is much clearer than the 60D. Even though it can still be improved.I don't like the Lock button on the 60D that you have to press down before you can change mode (from Tv to Av for example).Image quality is practically the same between the 2 cameras. This is the key consideration for me.
!###This camera has all the features for pro photography, plus it has really great video features And it is easy to use!                    Definitely worth buying at the price of deal! The Screen of T3i is more considerate than T2i, easy to use and looks fantastic~                    I love this camera.  Its light weight and allows me to take awesome pictures.  its easy to use and has loads of great features.                    I got this camera for my birthday and it is amazing.  The picture quality is great and it is pretty easy to use.  There is an automatic setting incase you do not want to mess with the customized settings.  18mp images look great on the camera and blown up on a computer or poster.  Highly recommend. Battery life was surprisingly good.                    This is an awesome camera for beginners. I have had some awesome shots from this camera and everything falls in right place.The manual controls for the video just adds to the quality of camera and the flip screen is also great value add compared to T2i!!Recommended!                    This is my first DSLR camera and so far I am Loving it. The learning curve seems steep but I have tinkered with some point and shoot cameras and have watched tons of video on photography so alot of the features of my Canon T3i seems familiar. The image quality on this thing is just mind blowing, I feel as though I am able to reproduce those photos I see from professionals, remember I said 'I feel', not necessarily I can at this point (lol). This is going to be one wild ride for me over the next few months; stay tuned.                    This camera performs absolutely amazingly! I've owned a few other cameras made by Canon, but this is by far my favorite camera I have ever owned. The quality and clarity of the pictures are amazing. On top of that, every video I have ever taken is very clear and picks up the sound wonderfully. I bought the camera right before my niece's wedding, hoping to take some quality shots for her. She was extremely happy with how they turned out. It is also very easy to use. If you are looking for a new camera I would strongly recommend the Canon Eos Rebel T3i.                    I LOVE THIS CAMERA. BEING ABLE TO VISULIZE MY PICTURES WITH OUT USING THE VIEW FINDER IS GREAT I WEAR BIFOCAL GLASSES AND USING THE VIEWFINDER HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CHALLENGE. ALSO BEING ABLE TO USE IT AT ANGLES WHERE YOU CANT GET TO THE VIEWFINDER IS VERY HELPFUL                    For the longest time I went back and forth between the t3i and nikon 5100. I chose canon because my friend has the t1i and I was already used to the menu setting and button layout.I love the swivel screen! I own an etsy shop, so it's going to be easier from now on to take pictures of myself with my items!Picture is soo clear! The only thing that I don't like is that when you enter the live mode, you can't see the focus points like how I'm used to with the T1i.I bought this when they had the promotion of the all the rebates with the extra lens, filter and printer.I got all that with taxes for under 900 bucks!Can't beat a deal like that!                    This DSLR excels in every way. Still pictures, videos, low light, special effects all superb. Make sure you have a Class 10 memory card for great video.
!###Overall, I'm really pleased with my new Canon T3i DSLR camera.  This is a replacement to my T2i.  Love the camera and the updated on-screen user interface.  No complaints about it.                    I am a film student, and I love shooting with this camera. The true 1080p picture quality with full manual controls are exactly what I needed at exactly the right price. The kit lens works fine for most wide and mid range shots, but not so good for close ups, unless you want to be 6 inches away from your subject....Overall, great camera. I would recommend this camera to anyone who asked me.                    I got this with the bundled promo at Amazon which basically gives the 55-250mm lens and the Canon Pixma Pro for free (after you consider the rebates).  Debated between this and the Nikon D3100, but at this price it can't be beat.Basically the same as the T2i so it is not worth it if you plan on upgrading from T2i. But for someone first buying a Canon DSLR, it is almost like buying the more expensive Canon 60D.                    I bought this camera bundled with a 55-250mm IS lens as an upgrade to my rebel xti. I noticed that the ISO as a major enhancement when compared to my rebel xti. Overall a great camera.                    I have been an Olympus shooter up until now. I'm starting photography school in just a few weeks and had to have a camera with video (oly e30 did not).After reading review after review, I decided to go with this wonderful camera. I'm so glad I did! I never thought I could get the colors out of another camera like I could my Olympus, but the image quality is excellent. I'm a female and the camera fits my hands perfectly. Another rave is that the controls are so easy to find and adjust, BIG plus for me. It was basically down to three cameras for me, the 7d, nikon 7000 , and the T3i. After taking many test shots in the store and getting a feel for the camera, this one won me over.The only complaint I have is that I wish it had a faster burst rate. I know the 60d is faster but after reading all the issues with that camera, it was off my list. Other than that, I have no other complaints.Buy it and enjoy it!Happy Shooting!                    Light camera, easy to use, excellent image and video. A perfect camera for beginners and for whom bought a first LSR camera.                    This is my first DSLR Camera and I did a lot of researching before purchasing it. I wanted to camera mainly for filming purposes. The camera did not disappoint. Filming was easy to use and came out beautifully. Now what surprised me is how much I ended up using the photo side of the camera. The pictures are almost unreal. I would highly recommend this camera to those looking to both take pictures and film.                    Received the camera as a gift and it has never worked. Attempting to return for repair and the Canon representatives are having a field day forcing me to jump through hoops due to no receipt. Have you been a given the receipt for a gift? There website states that without a receipt it will slow down the RMA process but DOES NOT state that they will require anything else for proof of purchase. It also doesn't say that they want to charge you $200 to repair a product that is currently under warranty! I was told that a copy of the warranty card would suffice for proof of purchase and am NOW being told that it's not enough. Canon - you not only have lost a good customer, you will lose many others with an attitude such as this!                    Great camera, takes very nice pictures and video.I still have a lot to learn because of all the features, but will have fun learning how to use it.                    This is more a review of Canons warranty and support than the camera itself.I bought the T3i + kit from Amazon late in August 2011.  My T3i camera will occasionally take pictures with compression lines running vertically through the picture.  This is about 1 in 10 pictures.  It is sort of like looking through wavy privacy glass.  I have lost critical wedding photos to this.So far over the course of 3 weeks trying to get a repair from the manufacturer Canon has blamed my laptop card reader, my workstation usb port, Windows 7 picture importer, Picasa picture importer, Lightroom picture importer, my class 10 SD card, my new class 10 SD card, My very newest professional 35mb/s SD card, and low batteries.  I have been run through multiple camera resets and I have actually been hung up on.  I have always been calm and professional when talking to support on the phone.Finally after multiple calls to Canon support they agreed to check the camera.  Now I have to ship it to Canons repair center paying for shipping and they will be keeping my camera for 10 business days for in house repair plus shipping times both ways.  There is no guarantee of fixing the problem or of swapping out my camera.  They actually stated on the phone that the 10 days could be longer as it is a busy time for them.  I am waiting to send it to them after years end as I do not want to be without a camera during Christmas two of my children's birthdays and New Year's. 1 in 10 bad photos is better than zero photos.  Canon will not advance replace cameras.I think if I had received a fully working camera this would be a 5 star review.  Instead I have to work with very poor customer support for a fairly expensive purchase.  I deal with Dell, HP, Microsoft and Cisco customer support at my work every day and Canon has by far the worst support or warranty I have had to deal with in recent memory.Hopefully your purchase will not need the support or warranty and you can simply enjoy a good product.  Personally, I will be looking to other companies when it is time to get a new camera.
!###I'm sure you bought this DSLR for the video capture feature, and that's fine.  However, at best this camera is a B-Camera.  It will not replace your camcorder due to the fact that it does not auto focus while recording.  In the manual, it does show you that you can AF while recording, but you constantly have to press the shutter button halfway.  One of the bad side effects is that refocusing is slow.  The AF speed isn't as lightning fast as if you're in Photo mode.  By the way, the AF is snappy quick when you're doing still shots.  So while you video record and press the shutter button to refocus, the camera CAN take 1-2 seconds until focus confirmation is achieved (HD video focus set to "AF-Quick" for those wondering about my settings).  This has been my experience with my Canon 17-40mm f4 L lens.  Another bad side effect (and the manual mentions it) is that if you are video recording and you press the shutter button to refocus, your video's Exposure changes.  Let's say it took 1.5 second to refocus, your recorded video will have sudden dark and bright scenes in that 1.5 second.  IT IS NOTICEABLE and VERY DISTRACTING.  I need to do more test to see if I can eliminate that.  The manual does not recommend this style of refocusing and to just do a manual refocus by hand using the lens's focus ring.Another thing I hate about this camera when video recording is that it will NOT let you select a slower shutter speed below 1/30 sec.  I own a Panasonic AG-HMC40 3CCD camcorder, and I can adjust the shutter/Aperture independently.  I can shoot at 1/12 sec at 24p.  But with this camera, I can't go lower than 1/30 sec if I shoot at either 30P or 24P.  At 60P, you can't go lower that 1/60 sec.  This was something I was not aware of prior to purchasing this camera.  Others will say, why would you want to shoot at a low shutter speed?  Well you can do strobe effects, or more importantly, the lower the shutter speed, the more light you can get.  Sometimes I use 1/12 sec for static night shots.EDIT -- I just realized that I can get better video footage under dark lighting when the "Movie Exposure" is set to AUTO.  I've had it set to Manual.  This is counter-intuitive to what I've been used to for my camcorder.Another thing I hate about this camera is the 12 minute time limit of HD recording!!!  From my test, the camera will STOP recording after 12mins.  I am recording with a 16GB SDHC card.  The user manual mentions it and is not a defect (but a handicap, IMO).  So if you set this camera on a tripod and start recording, you have to hit the record button every 12 minutes to continue.  This means that your video will not be smooth.  You'll have segments of video clips that don't seam together smoothly.It's 12min per 4GB on 24P, 30P and 60P.  By the way, I haven't had any overheating issues while recording.  But the camera does become WARM.  I was doing these test on a 68 degrees ambient room temp.  I'm not sure about summer time recording.  The user manual does mention about overheating.I'm really trying to love this camera, but I think I've been spoiled by my camcorder.But if you've read this far in this review, here's what I like about it:CONVENIENCE!  It's great to have a DSLR that can shoot excellent still shots and do HD video.SIZE! I've been to places where I absolutely can't bring both a DSLR (with 3 L-series lenses) and a camcorder at the same time... too much baggage and weight.  This consolidates everything in a nice small package.  It's small enough to not attract too much attention.  It's not as big as my camcorder, hence I can finally use a small camera bag.VARIO-SCREEN.  This is a camcorder trait that's finally on a DSLR.  I LOVE IT!  I can finally take some low or high position shots with ease.IMAGE QUALITY:  I own a Canon Rebel XT and the Canon 5D classic (not MK2).  This camera produces some really nice image, especially if you use some high quality lens.PRICE: I was thinking of getting the 60D, but price became a leading factor.  I paid $659 new, body only.Final thoughts:  I will most likely keep the camera because I already own some nice Canon lenses, but for those still debating about getting the Canon T3i or even the Nikon equivalent, I would recommend you look at the Sony A65.Why didn't I get the Sony A65?  I'm in too deep with Canon.  I've already bought some great lenses for the Canon Mount.  If you read this review and genuinely considered this camera, I suggest you get the SONY A65.  It has all the dislikes that I have about this camera fixed on their camera and more.  But if you already have some canon lenses, hold off until next year.  Canon MAY come out with a new DSLR body that can fix all of these issues.Recommendation:  If you decide to get this camera, then get a battery pack grip attachment with extra batteries!!!  YOU WILL NEED IT.  The battery that came with the camera (Genuine Canon) died before I can even fill up my 16GB card.  I did straight HD shooting with no rest and the battery indicator turned RED.  The screen is constantly on when you video shoot.  The optical view finder can't be used while HD recording because of the mirror flipped and locked.  This is an absolute essential if you decide to get some accessories.Good luck and shoot!                    The zoom is great, the settings are amazing , the megapixels are phonomomal and the Video is insane .. Love the camera , I would recommend it to anyone!!!                    Though the camera takes nice pictures and is in line with the Rebel line my biggest problem was that it developed a power issue after 4 weeks of use.  I contacted Canon for a repair and was refused an RMA, their only offer was for me to send it in at my own expense.Canon removed and apparently tossed out my LCD cover I had purchased from Amazon at the same time; they refused to replace or return it.I was a little taken aback that both as a Canon long time registered user and owner of many high end professional Canon products that Canon really felt no need to admit fault or rectify the situation.My daughter is happy to have the camera that was given to her, only to be taken away for repair, back.Having dealt with Nikon's customer service for over a decade through my job I can say that my interaction with Canon has tremendously cooled me on this company.Customer loyalty is a thing of the past and I believe brand loyalty is also on the wane.Keep your all packaging so that you can just return it to Amazon rather than deal with Canon direct or you will end up in the endless customer service loop where they just give you boilerplate and never solve anything.                    I bought this one instead of the cheaper T2i because of the flip-out screen.I had not had a DSLR before, so I didn't realize that when you use the screen to focus, you lose all the fancy auto-focus stuff that is above on the viewfinder.DSLRs are really designed to be used with the viewfinder. That's where all the good stuff is. When you switch to using the screen like you would with a point-and-shoot, the autofocus is much less sophisticated and slower. So, I do not use it much, and hence do not really make use of the fold-out screen.Other than that it is a great camera as everyone else has mentioned.You will want to get a better strap, as the one it comes with will make your neck sore pretty quickly.                    After many months of going back and fourth between the Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 Imaging with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens and the Nikon D5100 16.2MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens it really came down to price.  The Canon was over a $125 cheaper than the Nikon at the time of buying.  I like the fact that the Canon offered 1080p HD video.  Had great reviews from other sites and at least 3 of my friends recommended the Canon.At this point I highly recommend the Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 Imaging with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens.                    Fast shooting, quality images. Would be better if it could be a little cheaper if you consider prices of other competitors.                    Got this with the lens rebate deal to replace my T2i: Canon EOS Rebel T2i 18 MP CMOS APS-C Digital SLR Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD and EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens.  It has the same sensor as the T2i but with an lcd that's more useful for taking video.  Photos are about the same so if you already have the T2i it's not going to be an upgrade unless you use the video features (zoom) or need the articulating LCD.  I haven't used the wireless flash feature so I can't comment on that.  I received a MkII version of the kit lens which is almost identical to the MkI version (except for some cosmetic changes).The price of this kit has fluctuated quite a bit in the last month (~$60 range) so keep an eye on it.                    Just got the camera.  Started to explore all options and the 3" viewfinder that flips out is very cool.  For the price and long term investment, this is one of the cameras that should be in your top three.                    Love the tilting screen. One of the problems with digital cameras is that you cannot see the picture in bright sun. Problem solved with tilt screen and with view finder. My lens from my Canon Rebel 35mm camera work well on this camera. Wish I had bought camera without lens because I never use the one that came with camera. It is good for taking pictures inside since it has image stabilization but you need longer lens for outdoor shots across the baseball field. It you do not already have lens you will enjoy having the one that comes with camera. Very, happy with camera. It has more features than I will ever learn to use.                    Camera might be great, but amazon says they will ship the camera with a 32GB SD card, guess what, huge back order, so now I have a camera that can't be used.
!###This is the first Apple product for me and I love it. With this 8&#34; size Apple made excellent yob! It is perfect for traveling, good fit in hand and still big enough for watching movies on it. For shore, this is certainly not my last piece of Apple technology at home.                    i can now see the screen..takes excellent pictures..someone told me there is a phone app for it but i cant find it                    These days Apple is losing the excitement factor over the Android phones and tablets that are fancier and come in enough shapes and sizes to suit your taste. I, myself, have tried the Android phones and tablets but have come back to Apple for two main reasons: Consistency and Quality,I have always wanted an iPad but the cumbersome and awkward size was always the turn off to me. I wanted something easy to carry and put away; the iPad just seemed a bit too large. I eventually gave in to an Android tablet and Enjoyed it to an extent but it became clunky and cluttered. The quality felt a bit too plasticky as well.Then Apple announced the iPad Mini and I was ready to give it a try. THIS DEVICE ROCKS! I cannot say enough good things about it; it's the quality hardware and software Apple is known for. I can always count on my iPad Mini to work and do so like it did the first time, never slowing down.So... If you are in the market for a small tablet and don't mind paying the premium I highly recommend the iPad Mini. Sure, it's a bit more expensive but if you have it know you are paying for a slick device that won't turn into a frustrating paper weight next year. :)                    I had the iPad 32gb wifi original. I sold it through amazon sales. I wanted something lighter weight and smaller. I'm a writer, publisher, and a student. I needed something that wasn't going to take up a lot of space in my bag. My macbook adds just enough extra weight that makes my bag hurt my shoulder. So, I had it and invested in the iPad mini.I purchased the refurbished one from Apple. It was sent from China and I got it in a surprisingly short time. I am amazed at how light weight this piece is. I purchased the white because for me I just thought it was very nice looking. I don't put a lot of stuff on the iPad itself so the wifi 16gb is more than enough for me. If I watch music I use Amazon Instant Video or Netflix. I also use this to read a lot of my kindle books. I sold my Kindle fire original on Amazon as well, since I am spring cleaning and trying to get rid of all my excess crap.For this iPad it is small but it is beneficially small. It is perfect for me. I have small hands so the on screen keyboard size isn't a bother. However, I did purchase the white Logitech keyboard case to match.I wasn't concerned about retina display. I think at this size the condensed screen showing HD videos is more than enough. Honestly, if you're that concerned over quality of photos and videos past standard HD then you should be on a full size iPad or a computer itself.                    The apple iPad mini is great. After having an ipad for a year, I love the size of the iPad mini. Small enough to throw in my purse, but big enough to be able to read the print.                    I'm much more impressed than I thought I would be with the new iPad mini.  For comparison purposes I currently use my Nexus 7 tablet, Acer Iconia A500 tablet, Kindle tough and HTC One X. I'm not going to nitpick hardware specs.  Sure the screen isn't IPS but I don't see the big difference unless I have two devices side-by-side.  In actual use,  they all have fantastic screens.=========================10=Good,  1=Bad=========================Browsing  7Gaming  8Reading  8Productivity/Work 6Battery Life  9Adapters 5Connectivity 5 (proprietaryVideo Playback 8Wifi Performance  4CPU/UI Speed  9=========================Overall = 6.9=============================== IPAD TIPS ==========================================================  * Close an app: our or five finger pinching motion  * Navigate open apps: four or five fingered horizontal swipe  * Take a screen shot: Hold the power button and home button.

This is a much better ebook reader than I thought it would be.  In low light situations it is much nicer than a Kindle. The devise is easier to hold with two hands than one. The iPad mini is also great for gaming and watching videos.  I have a larger tablet (10.1) also and this size is just more fun and portable. I accessed my work desktop using Citrix Receiver and it worked great for reading email and other documents and impromptu typing. Sound quality was excellent as usual. The new power connector is easier to plug in. The battery life far exceeds than any other device I own except the Kindle Touch.The things that I thought could use some improvement were few but an annoying few.  WiFi performance is really lacking.  At home, at work and on travel the Wifi is really slow.  App downloads are horribly slow on connections I know to be fast.  I tried connecting at 5G also and it didn't make any improvement. Every once in a while I think the screen jitters.  It would be an artifact from the scree auto-rotating.  I was a little disappointed that it didn't come with some nice Apple earbuds. For the price I would have expected it. The power adapter is yet another Apple-proprietary connector.  So more money on chargers and more chargers laying around.Overall this is a great tablet with awesome performance and has an extremely convenient size.                    The iPad Mini is a great tablet - it gets 5 stars, but it's probably more like 4 stars for me because my eyes just do not like the smaller screens any more.  I actually traded my mini to someone for an iPad 3 which suits my purposes better.  If you need the portability and don't mind the smaller screen, it's convenience and performance are great.  I'd just recommend seeing it in person and using both size tablets (and Retina vs. regular display) to see which suits you best.                    I received my iPad Mini, just as described and I love it!  It might be a little heavier than I expected, but not a problem.  The one thing I don't like about it is the active screen is so close to the edges that sometimes when I'm holding it in my hand, my fingertips interfere with the functioning.  I purchased an inexpensive Khomo case for it and that made all the difference in the world.                    This is an amazing tablet/computer. It's so light and the thinnest tablet I've ever seen. 7.9 inches may seem small on your computer screen, but it's actually a decent size. And light and small enough to hold in only one hand. It's perfect for typing papers with Pages. But I do recommend buying a BlueTooth keyboard, which is what I am using now to type this review. Watching movies is awesome. And games from the App Store are so fun to play. The only down side is that it's not as clear as the full size iPad. But that really isn't a big deal unless you're super crazy about that kind of stuff. Otherwise I highly recommend this tablet to anyone looking for something like this. I hope you decide to buy one, it'll be worth the money.                    I already have numerous Apple products, and I even have a Ipad. The mini offers everything the bigger one has with a little more portability. Fast shipping an good price. Would recommend.
!###arrived on time, works perfectly  I recommend buying it, is a good choice for a good price, FIVE STARS FOR THIS PRODUCT                    It does all the things the original iPad did and it's easy to carry. I just streamed a movie to AppleTV. Awesome for reading. I dictated this review with my iPad mini. It is worth the slight premium. The bottom line is will you use it and I already have been a lot.                    Ordered this as a gift for my kids on Christmas.  Instant hit, very easy to use, and because of the size it is a lot easier to handle for kids with small hands.                    Perfect because it has all functions of the full-size iPad and it is lighter. But it could also include smartphone functions, considering that the SIM card is already in place. If so, I would only need to carry one gadget instead of two today. Think about it....                    I am NOT an Apple Junkie. Yes I own 2 Apple products: the new Nano and the iPad mini. Ive had ipads before but they were too big and heavy. With the mini I get the perfect size tablet. Screen res is not as my Samsung galaxy 2 7.0. But there is more content available for the ipad. I like the mini's ease of use and makes a good 2nd tablet. Now I have a good Android and Apple tablet. If Apple would a better display it would be the.best tablet.                    Outstanding product from my favorite computer company. Works great, very fast, super app's and so many more to find! Love working with it.                    As everyone i love the Apple products, i have an iphone, ipod, mac and to complete the collection the ipad mini, the devices is awesome, the weight is really light, size adequate. Perfect to carry wherever you go and work but you should buy in the store, my box brought a damaged cable, not such a big deal but i had to go to the store and ask for an exchange, the did it without showing the receipt, after that everything was fine.                    Ok so I have a nexus 7 and as much as I love it and love the android operating system I can't lie and say the performance is always wonderful. It doesn't matter what the specs are it stutters with web browsing, a lot of games lag. It's really nice for the price but meh. Anyways I decided to overpay for the iPad mini because i'm an idiot and also because I saw better performance from youtube videos. Plus I wanted some of the exclusive apps. The tablet performs amazingly. Every app, game, and just everything runs great! The screen could be sharper for what I paid but I will take performance over a pretty screen any day. I kinda find ios a bit boring as well because I prefer the complication of android. I would love the emulators but i can't get them on the mini. There's no jailbreak for the mini so no emulators. The camera is ok but I have an actual camera that kills the ipads camera so that's nothing worth paying for. I love the screen size, and the weight. I love how thin the device is as well. All in all it's a great tablet but it does carry a price tag based on the massive ego of apple and not so much the product. 1 star is removed for the price. It's hard to remove more then that because I really like the product.                    Everything about this has been a breeze; my order was filled promptly; syncing to my old iPod's information took but a minute and getting the hang of all its bells and whistles is a cinch. This product is sturdy, well-built and even bigger than I thought it would be; processing is fast and picture is clear. In short, I love it and would recommend to anyone.                    I'm not an "iSheep", I'm not a total tech person and I don't prefer everything to be Apple, but they really do make premium products, and to be honest, I really like this tablet. It's the perfect size.. it isn't too small or too big. It's so much lighter and so much better looking that my previous ipad 3 which I ended up getting rid of just to get this. I bought this at Best Buy a few days ago and I love it! It runs so smoothly, and I can hold it up for a long time before it strains my wrist. It's so portable, I could carry it anywhere. The charger is less clunky.  The tablet is so smooth.. feels really nice. I like the smaller bezels, it gives so much more space. Why I love the Mini is because it's not too small, but it's not big either. It's almost the perfect reading device. I can also type easily.My biggest obvious complaint is that it has no Retina display. Yes, I know the second one will have Retina, but I really didn't want to wait to replace the heavier iPad 3. And truthfully, the screen's resolution isn't horrible, but it's a much better improvement from the ipad 2. However, looking at the Mini, you will notice text will be blurrier and you will see individual pixels if you are used to Retina. Had it had Retina and better specifications, I would've given it five stars. I can't complain, I chose to buy it. Plus, Apple seems to still be selling their iPad 2 for $399. Overall, I am happy with my purchase. This device has potential and it's very fun.
!###Too small, No hard copy instruction book!wish I could trade it for a kindle fire hd. Hate it hate it                    Not only does it crop the pics, especially Facebook. Every app seems to be a preview and you have to pay to get a full version, unlike the Android version. I will never buy a I product again. Pretty good camera though.                    I don't get it why is this company charging $389 when you can buy everywhere else for $329. Simple price gouging if you ask me                    I was really excited about getting an I-pad mini for my birthday. Now, I wish my husband had purchased something else. It took about four hours for Apple to get it up and running. Four hours! I knew it wouldn't be as simple as turning on a button, but four hours is a bit much. One reason I wanted this was to do on-line banking and to deposit checks. I don't have a smart phone. while the I-pad mini has that feature, I am unable to get it to log on to my account. Calling my credit union didn't help. The gentleman kept insisting that I had to be entering in a wrong password. I wasn't.There is a problem with this I-pad mini. I have had other difficulties with it. One is that when I turn it on, I have to attempt to slide the buttonthree times then it shuts down, then I hit the home button, and only then will the slide button work.Another problem is in the keyboard. The letter b shows up in places I haven't put it. No, I'm not hitting any wrong keys. I've checked that out, and that wasn't the problem. I'm getting ready to take this gadget back to the store where I purchased it. Perhaps it is as another reviewer wrote that used ones are being sold as new. Maybe this is a so called new one that is really a used one.Another thing, no instructions came with this that even told me how to turn it on. I had to figure that out all by myself.My daughter purchased a cheaper brand, took her about one minute to set it up, and it works better than my expensive mini. Maybe for social media it's great. I don't do social media, so I really wouldn't know about that.I ordered three albums from I-tunes on it: one I was charged a dollar for. Then that was taken off my bank balance, and I still haven't been billed the correct amount. Another was supposed to have been $6.98 plus tax. It came to $17.something. There seems to be no rhyme nor reason to their pricing.Grrr!Another problem is the battery. This definitely does not hold a charge, even though I turn the device off when I'm not using it. This is just annoying, and I've decided not to use it for an e-reader. I have my Kindle,and the battery holds a charge much better. I am thinking about purchasing a kindle fire. I really can't see the I-pad mini as any kind of substitute for an e-reader or lap top.                    I was the happy owner of a Kindle Fire until my husband decided to "upgrade me" to an Ipad Mini as an anniversary gift.  Yes, it's shiny and lighter but extremely fragile. An accidental drop of no more than three-feet. . . the result: a hairline crack (top left to bottom right and a semi-circle hairline crack on both ends).  While I repeatedly read online that if you catch an Apple employee "on a good day" they may do it for free, the helpful Apple employee I spoke to was quick to quote $219 to replace it because I don't have Apple Care (since this was a gift I had never heard of Apple Care).  A new Ipad Mini costs $329 and a screen replacement starts at $219? How does that make sense?  Should've bought the Kindle Fire HD!                    The quality of the screen on this tablet for this price is really poor.  Text looks really bad on it compared to other "mini" tablets that are a lot cheaper.  I am staying with my nexus 7.  When I used the ipad mini the text seemed a lot worse then my nexus 7 which is 40% cheaper.  The aspect ratio is 4:3 which is not good for video, low resolution, low pixel desnity, no gps.                    They said the product was in amazing shape, and it was like new.Well, the ipad is far from being in a good shape, horrible scratches on the sleep button, and the touch screen does not work in some areas!Horrible porduct! Horrible deal!                    This ipad is without retina display. Apple and other stores are selling it for $300 recently got one. This is expensive and they are calling this a deal....                    No wi fi. Spent 2hours with Apple rep. on phone.Should have been tested.Seems to work .fine now but still keeping box for return.                    It is ok I am so used to my androii that apple is not good for me!!! I can not used my swipe
!###I have had a REFURBISHED iPad for 2yrs that is 100% better than this expensive piece of junk. I purchased this because of its size and easy portability. Should have just stuck with my original and saved $400. It shuts itself down, freezes and just today sounded like it sparked and I had a totally blue screen for 10 minutes before either I finally got it to shut down or it crashed itself. Unfortunately for me, I was overly optimistic when I purchased it and threw the damn box away so I'm stuck.                    We only gave one star because zero stars was not an option.  We just bought my daughter a mini for Christmas and she loved it.  It was sitting on her desk and the glass screen broke, spent over an hour with service reps that gave us the too bad, so sad, she must have dropped it (she didn't).  It will cost well over two hundred dollars to repair, I'm sure about three hundred when it is all said and done.  Even the reps i spoke with said their screens broke too...what a bummer.  If this is a problem this big Apple had better fix it fast.  We will never buy another Apple anything.  Their one year warranty is a complete joke it covers absolutely nothing.  All of my daughters school work is on this four hundred dollar apple paper weight.  Don't fall for any of their jargon, it means nothing, just like their customer satisfaction.  Buyer should beware, read all of the fine print, have your lawyer look it over because they WILL weasel out of it. We got three whole months before this happened.  The extra warranty doesn't cover anything either, only cost a hundred and fifty more.  I guess we see why apple is being overtaken by Samsung, because that is what we are getting next.  Uuurrrrgghh just spent the last hour with apple reps who do nothing.  Sorry for the rant just wanted to warn anybody thinking of buying junk.  You are better off throwing four hundred dollars in the wind.  Any questions email me at waynorsgirl1@yahoo.com before buying.  Thank you for your time/                    Well, I am not here to tell you how good/pretty/friendly Apple products are, but I am here to tell you how cheaply this ipad mini is made.  It is so thin that it is very fragile.  I had the ipad mini covered with a case and my little girl dropped it from her hand, which is about 2'5" feet high, onto a wooden floor and it is cracked right away.  The replacement screen service from Apple will cost about $220 which is almost the price of a new one.  The replacement screen sells on Amazon or elsewhere is about $60-150, the $60 one requires professional soldering, but the similar digitized screen for a regular ipad2 is cost only about $30 bucks.  Do you see where I am going?  They made a fragile product, jacked up the price of the service and cost for the replacement screen.                    The iPad mini is a good product, I guess, but here is my problem.  I have two original ipads (a Gen I and recent Gen III).  The big ipads are very robust; kids play with them, drop them out windows, use them to build forts, teach the dogs to fetch, etc., and I throw them in my pickup, use them on the jobsite, whatever.  Ive had the Gen I since 2010, and the other one for more than a year, and, although they both have extensive damage to the metal cases, and although the screen seal of the Gen I is half gone, neither screen has ever cracked.Both of my ipad minis have cracked screens.  One broke while bouncing up and down on the floor of my truck while driving on a dirt  road. The other screen broke when two of my kids were in a tug o war over the ipad. They didn't drop it, one just twisted it out of the others' hand and it cracked.  The ironic thing was when I went to the istore, and some "Genius" explained to me that I am totally wrong, and the iPad mini is much more robust than the ipad original.  Obviously I know the "Genius" thing is supposed to be ironic, but this was still a little irritating.Here is the deal. The ipad mini with a broken screen costs $219 to fix.  That is right. $220 to fix a product that costs a hair over $300 bucks.  I sold the first one on ebay for $170 (I mean, seriously, who would pay $170 for a broken ipad mini? What is going on there? Who knows?)  I am about to list the second.Bottom line: If you are a very careful old lady who uses the ipad mini once or twice a month on foam rubber on the floor and caresses the screen gently with a hypoallergenic goose feather before your servant locks it back away in a padded vault, this is the perfect device for you. On the other hand, if you are like a regular person who might actually use the device in the real world, the ipad mini is a little too dainty, especially if you have kids. I would definitely recommend the big ipad instead.Go on the apple support forums and you will see that my problem is very common with the mini.  Good luck!                    So disappointed with this transaction.  I was eagerly awaiting my white iPad Mini that I ordered and they sent a black one with a label over the description so I didn't realize I had the wrong product until I opened up the box.  I tried to order another but it was getting so complicated and close to a trip that I wanted to use the iPad on, I just returned it and purchased the correct item at Walmart where I instantly received it and it was cheaper too!                    yes sir i just want to know if this is open box  coz there is something line on the screen once i opened it                    Not sure what they were thinking here because it renders the device basically unusable.However, there is a camera that I use to take pictures of my cats.  I cannot figure how to get them off the device so as a workaround I display the photo I want on screen and take a picture of the screen with a Kodak disposable camera and get the pictures developed at Walgreens.  Works like a charm, hence the 5 star review.                    when I used my mini ipad easily seen that the system hangs and I have to reset at least twice a day since my youngest widely used interactive games.I did not like because of this.                    Hello, I want to buy the ipad mini to bring Venezuela, I do not know if you can use it with different phone operators which are named there. my phone operator is movistar.
!###Three words: wonderful, wonderful. wonderful. I already own an Ipad 2 and wanted a smaller screen for traveling, bedside etc. So, I thought I'd enter the Android world and purchased a Samsung Galaxy tab 2. The 8gb available is not nearly sufficient and the micro SD slot will not allow you to transfer apps or rented/ purchased tv and movies because of copyright issues. So, what is the point of expandable memory?? Returned it and bought the Google Nexus 7. This is a nice tablet but I was frequently charging the battery and the 7" size looked small to me. Thank goodness I purchased it at a retailer where I had 15 days to return. I visited an Apple store and happened to look at the Ipad minis. I could not wait to return the nexus and I bought the mini. Sure, more money, but you get what you pay for. These tablets are so smooth, and display none of "hesitation" while scrolling that the Android tablets do. The color and contrast are far superior to the android tablets and the 7.9 inch screen looks huge next to the 7" Android screens. BUY IT! You'll love the Ipad mini.                    I was on the fence with purchasing the iPad mini and am so glad I did. When the original iPad came out I purchased it, but later sold it because with having both an iPhone & a MacBook, I couldn't justify having another portable device - but the mini changes this. I absolutely love this smaller design, it is so much lighter & fits in one hand so it is so much easier & enjoyable to use and the way the edges are curved it just fits perfect in the hand. All of the full sized iPads (especially the latest Retina generation) are beautiful & wonderful, but if you're looking for something that's more comfortable in the hand where you don't have to constantly hold it with two hands or rest it against your legs because of the size & weight, the mini is your best bet. I now find that I use my iPad mini ALL THE TIME because it feels so right in my hands. Plus, since it's smaller it's much easier for me to slip in my purse & carry on the go.As with all iPad's I've used, it functions & performs just as beautifully. Of course, the mini doesn't have the power that the full sized iPads have, so if you're wanting to do graphic intensive games or videos, go with the full sized iPad. I have played lots of basic games & constantly stream videos all without a problem, but it may be an issue if you want to do graphic intensive games. I stream video from my iPad to my Apple TV daily (cuts cable!) and I've never had a problem with any lags or graphic problems (unless my wifi goes out...my wifi company is iffy & has been for years, but that's a whole different story).The only thing that would make this iPad mini perfect is if it had a Retina display. I know it is only a matter of time & we will (hopefully) see a retina display on the second generation iPad mini, but I really wish they could have done a retina display the first time around. Switching from my iPhone 5 to the mini I can definitely see a loss in the sharpness of text which is unfortunate since I love using my iPad mini for reading books. It's not a huge deal since everything still looks great & is more than useable (in fact, if you don't have any other Apple products with retina you probably won't know what I'm talking about), but if you're going from a retina display iPhone or iPad you really will notice the loss of quality.Overall, it's a great product & I highly recommend it! Of course there are other brand tablets with lower price points, but I love the quality & service of Apple products & that's what keeps me coming back.                    Love the mini.  Does everything it's bigger siblings can do, and a lot more conveniently.  Almost wish you could make calls with it!                    I've owned the iPad 2 for more than a year now. I use it everyday mostly for reading. I've tried many games on it and found the game experience to be wanting.iPad mini changes everything.Before taking the Mini home, there were things I obviously liked, and some things I was a little worried about. For instance, although you can hold the Mini with no effort because of how light it is, I heard talk that comic books were harder to read because of the smaller size.i haven't found this to be true. After reading several comics, I am very pleased with the experience.And games - all those games I couldn't quite get into because of the size of the larger iPads have now been opened up to me. The lightness of the mini, combined with the positioning of your hands on it's smaller frame have changed the experience. The thin bezel at the sides has proven to be plenty wide enough for me. The same games I tried on the larger iPad 2 are now much more enjoyable on the iPad mini. A big enough screen to enjoy the action, but not so big as to introduce awkwardness.Oh, also the speakers on the Mini are great. You will not be straining to hear what's going on in the videos you watch and games you play, unlike the iPad 2 experience.Throw in Siri and a respectable camera, and the iPad mini is the defining iPad experience in my opinion. I don't even miss not having retina, as some theorized would be the case.Do yourself a favor and get at least the 32 gb size. You don't want to continuously have to delete stuff in order to make room. Also, iPads slow down when they start getting low on memory. 32 gb will give you plenty of room for lots of stuff to enjoy, while leaving enough room so your iPad doesn't get bogged down.                    I placed an order for the iPad Mini 64 GB WIFI.  I ordered it from TechGiant.  The order was shipped promptly.  However, to my surprise, when I went to register the device to qualify for Apple's free one year warranty, I was informed that the device had already been registered by another user in 2012 and that I only had 119 days remaining in the warranty.  That might explain why the battery was 20% low when I plugged it in and it prompted me to restore files from iCloud.  I plugged the device in and the charger didn't even work.  I paid $519 for a device that was advertised as new but it was not.  I didn't have a way to contact the shipper so I contacted Amazon.  They instructed me to return the item for a refund.  They also gave me a link to try to contact the seller.  I called a phone number on the seller's website and left a message explaining the situation.  I stated I wanted to give them the opportunity to correct the problem.  This was a few days ago and I still have not received a return call from the seller.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed and still don't have an iPad Mini I need for a trip I have coming up.                    Being an android user for the past four years I was skeptical at just how much I would like an apple tablet, but I have seen the light. I finally bit the bullet and now have my first apple tablet and could kick myself for not doing it sooner. I wear three professional hats as an actor, producer, and business owner and the iPad has apps not found on the Android market that have immensely increased my productivity in all three. Also, the iPad makes entertainment SO much easier managing everything through iTunes. If you aren't sure whether to go with an Android tablet or Apple trust me I've now had both and can tell you won't regret going with the iPad. That is just my opinion.                    Buyer Beware! No where in the product description does it say the product you receive may be used. Mine was. The back was scratched even though the ipad was packaged correctly. Not just one scratch but a group of them. In one small section there was a small gouge.I returned it to Amazon the same day it arrived and went to the Apple store to purchase the ipad mini.                    I  made the mistake of purchasing the iPad mini, mainly because it was more compact to fit in a briefcase. It had great reviews & such, so figured it would be a functional tablet. And it probably is for playing games, music and things like that. But it is really lacking as a tool to use in business.The iPad mini, & I have no reason to believe the iPad is any different, comes without an office suite, a way to easily transfer files from a PC unless you use the Cloud or the iTunes Utility, which for security reasons cannot be used in my business, & few apps are without a cost. In this world, people often have multiple platforms at work & home. Even in the app store, there is no direct link to business apps. You must search for everything. With lots of time, searching & frustration at times, the tablet is now functional. I will not go into the lack of multitasking & other small inconveniences.Trying to get a manual for this unit was another treat! You would think it would be included on the desktop as a PDF file. Every Web search to find a User Manual lead you to links to other sites wanting you to download their PDF, Anti Virus or some other tool bar software. When I finally found a manual but it was specific to the iPad even though the internet search said it was a manual for the iPad Mini. Still haven't found anything very specific to the iPad Mini that I own. I will use the iPad with iOS 6 manual and hopefully it covers everything if there are differences. With Android Tablets it is just a matter of searching for the word pdf and the tablet and up comes your manual. Apple has to tie everything into collateral sales by linking with everyone.Paired with a Bluetooth keyboard, it is easy to put in data & I would recommend adding one. I also find a stylus works better than a finger on this tablet. Thankfully I got the 64G mini or would be in trouble since it is not expandable with a Micro SD card. Bad for consumers who have to pay more for this & only good for Apple's bottom line.I could go on about the iOS vs others, etc. but it comes down to having setup & used a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 in a few hours & I saw how easy it was to use, I would never recommend an iPad Mini over the Galaxy Note 10.1 for business use if your business is Windows centric rather than Apple based. Transfers of data is painful when you want to share between the two operating systems.
!###There is a lot of things not working on my ipad mini and when I call apple for help, apple wanted more money before they would give me any advice on how to work my iPad mini. My iMessage & ICloud wouldn't work and still isn't working, I'm refusing to pay more money for something I've already paid more than enough already. On top of that it seems an ipad is very limited to what an ipad can actually be used for. You will still need a regular laptop or home computer for most things, for iPad doesn't allow, which is A Lot!. iPad mini is basically a big mobile unit. It's not looked at as a laptop. It would be better to buy a lap top than a iPad!!!!! iPad is a empty money pit that doesn't end, it's like buying a used car.                    I have a IPad in the normal size but this one is very confortable to carry anywhere, principally in trips.                    The IPad Mini rocks. It let me download anything i want and in the living room. There's full connection. Apple rocks. All of the people who like this rocks also and to the people who's smart and knows about this and has an special award goes to... Scott. the ipad mini also have internet at other places also if u sign it into Cisco Connect. and the Photo Booth is epic. My sister uses the photo booth all time, sometimes she goes to Youtube to watch Spongebob and stuff. and the Videos looks different which that's epic for an mini thing.                    I find it is not a user friendly device like my amazon devices.  The obvious is not obvious to me, and I have to do much searching and googleing......becoming a pain.....I am disappointed in the operating system......but I will keep trying......Amazon seems to hold your hand while learning.....the apple ipad is not that easy to use. I spent hours trying to get on the ipad internet, only to find out I was aready on the internet!  I felt so dumb!!!!  I love my Kindle.....so I do not know what the heck I am doing with this device?????  I cannot tell you how long it took me to import my kindle books to this ipad device........too long!  However, I began to find my Fire too heavy for all day use with my arthritic fingers. I will keep plugging away with this ipad device......however, I find it very labor intensive, and not enjoyable yet.......thank you for asking for my humble opinion......Gayle                    I love my iPad Mini. It is much faster than my Kindle Fire HD. Amazon please put the Google Play Store into the Amazon AppStore has more app                    To small to expensive. Android device my wife has is faster and about $100 CHEAPER.  hate total dependence on Itune store                    It is very nice, easy to operate, but the screen is kind of small to me, but it is OK.                    upon arrival parcle was not secured and packed properly,  the item was in a damaged and dented box when received                    Got this on time which was ok but i received it with scratches on the screen and there was no charger, earbuds or anything else with it but the iPad and that was received in a damaged box. When i opened up the iPad it had a huge crack and it didn't work at all so i bought a brand new iPad. Also i couldn't ship it back                    The ipad mini is a great piece of hardware. It is a perfect device.... nearly. There are some things that i want to tell you.The ipad mini is not better than the ipad 2 or only a little bit. The price compared to the size and all other aspects is too high.I had it in my handy and have testet it. The ipad is a couch device. So why do i need a small version, if i can have a big version for nearly the same price?So or so it does not fit good into a small bag. Compare it before you buy it [...]
!###I love this Ipad.  I own every generation of the fat Ipads and when they came out with a smaller size I thought it was stupid.  But I never judge on idea unless i experience it.  To my surprise I loved the Ipad Mini the moment it was on my hand.  It was extremely light and nice feel to the hands. Now having to own a Ipad Mini, I actually carry this one with me at all times.  I use it to watch movies and many other things, it is the perfect size for someone who is always on the go.  Battery life is amazing as well.  I went to Japan with this Ipad and was able to watch all the movies I loaded on there with 90% battery life on a 14 hour flight!                    works great, fits in my purse and the only thing i wish it had was built in wifi, but other than that it is a great tablet.                    I've been an apple fan for a while. We still even have our fist generation iPad 16 GB. When I first saw that apple released a smaller iPad, I thought it was kind of pointless. I was recently given this iPad mini from my employees and I've been pleasantly surprised by how much I have enjoyed using it. The size, weight and performance is just right. I can't complain. I use it every day for surfing the web. The battery life has been great. I picked up a knock-off Smart Cover case for $9 on Amazon and I'm all set. I highly recommend it.                    Wow - this is really cool!  I bought this to process credit card sales online and it does so many cool things besides.  I'm not terribly computer savvy but Apple is very user friendly.                    A year into owning the first generation iPad Mini, I can say it was a great buy for myself and as a gift for my father.Pros:I've never owned a tablet before the iPad Mini. I had toyed with getting a Nexus 7, but the Google Play Store just didn't have enough tablet specific apps. I owned an iPhone so I chose to stay within that ecosystem. The app selection for the iPad/iPad Mini is great. The non-retina display is not a concern for me. The display is still very good looking though. The size and weight feel great in your hands and is a great in-between of a smartphone and a laptop. I particularly like the aluminum back. It's cold to the touch when you first start using it, but then adapts to your hand temperature. It's solid hardware and feels very premium.Cons:Speaking of premium, the price. When I bought the iPad Mini in 2012, it was $330 and the processor was already a year behind at that point. The price point as of late 2013 is $299, with the new iPad Mini at a whopping $399. The hundred dollar difference between the 7.9 inch iPad Mini and the 9.7 inch iPad Air makes it difficult to decide. Especially since the new Nexus 7 is only $230 and Amazon Kindle Fire at $139. The processor is still OK, but it can lag on graphic intensive games. If you don't play much of those, you'll be fine. Movies, Youtube, etc all play extremely well.Rating: 5 out of 5.Recommended: Yes.  If you decide to shell out money for an Apple product, you're buying into a great app ecosystem and great hardware that you'll be happy with.                    What else can I say? It came in perfect condition. The packaging was definitely good, and I use this more than I thought I would, even when I already have a smartphone. It's super easy to carry around and I sometimes uses it to take notes in class or check emails real quick.                    I give the mini 5 stars. It has everything that it's larger sibling has but just in a pint size easy to hold body. Much bigger than my iPhone 5 but not so big and heavy that I can't use it with one hand. Great for reading, email, photo editing. It is my primary business tool for my small business.                    We got this for my mom who has avoided computers forever. She loves that she can download books from all available apps. She takes it everywhere, so she always has downloaded reading material. She also loves the camera and many of the different creative camera apps. The 10 hrs of power you get from a full charge have been more than sufficient for her. The standard 16gb. also seems like plenty of storage for her. But there are other options if you feel your needs are greater. This is very easy to use, and great for someone who may be intimidated by, a full size computer, or laptop, with the ability to do almost all of the same things.                    Bought this so my daughter would stop using my regular iPad to play all her games but liked it so much I've sort of switched and use this one and give her my old one!                    I love this thing.. They are a little pricey, for their size.. But it Works! I just wish Apple would make ICloud and ITunes a little more user friendly...The Mini is awesome!!
!###This has got to be Apple's greatest product yet. Not only does it shield me from the fiery breaths of Medieval dragons but it also allows me to time travel. It also has a pop out toaster and waffle maker. Keep in mind that you have to have your own bread and waffle mix because Apple likes to give you one part but charges you an arm and a leg for the other part.  The only complaint I have it that it doesn't come with proprietary arms to do my dishes and give me back rubs.                    Best seller I have ever dealt with.  He extended the return for this iPad mini, because I was giving it for a gift.  Very honest and great communication.  The product was just as described and the shipping was super fast.  Excellent seller.                    I love the form factor but I have to say that I'm very disappointed with the durability of the device. Both my screen and back are scratched after dropping my device by accident. I should be happy I didn't get a spider web on my screen but they say the glass is gorilla glass so why is the glass easily scratched? i've dropped my nexus 7 more times than I could count and I have had no scratches on the front and back.I expected durability knowing it's an apple product.                    Piece design was not what I expected.  This is a magnetic cover only.  Provides no protection to base and limited protection to face.My plan was to return it until I found a clear hard plexiglass cover, made by Rocktfish, that the tablet securely snaps into. Then the magnetic iPad cover slips perfectly into place as if they were designed for this purpose.I still wish there was a full cover designed by Apple for the iPad mini.  This is swell for now.  Fits nicely, very slim profile, in my handbag without conflict.                    i dot now what happen, but the product it does not work... i think it recibed a crash duiring the transportation... i dot know wthat can i do?                    I've purchased several Apple products. They eventually drop. Mine dropped while I was seating, I even tried catching it on the air but a 45 cm fall was enough to assassin this glass-only device. The edges are so slim that they will bend and quickly press the glass to rupture. If you buy this, it has to be bundled with a bumper or any sort of similar protection, else, you may know its fate.                    The ipad mini isn't really a bad tablet. It does what it's supposed to. No flash but whatever. My qualm is how freaking fragile this thing is. I dropped mine literally a foot of the ground. Cracked on the right corner. Hey apple do ya ever test out your products. Do you think now one is going to drop your swarovski glass? Get a kindle fire for a cheaper price. Pretty much get any tablet other than this. I shouldn't have a $300 portable piece of equipment crack from a one foot fall. This isn't a laptop where you put it on the table. You keep this in your hands. No gracias APPLE!                    Crashes on any app including built in apps like maps after 20 seconds or so.  Went back and forth with apple.  The store wants to replace our brand new mini with a refurbished unit.  Will never support apple or the products again.  I am completely dissatisfied with the product and lack of support.                    Do not order anything from BMG Logic.  I ordered a NEW Ipad Mini and got a USED one with finger prints and a scratch on the screen.  The back of the IPAD was dirty from finger prints and the package was not sealed in a new box.  Not even the USB cord was wrapped right.If I wanted used I would have ordered used.  I ordered new and paid the price of new.Very disapponted customer.  I am trying to return this item and will get one somewhere else.                    Not a good device at all.  Memory is woefully inadequate in the base model, and Apple charges $100 for a lousy 16gb of additional memory in upgraded models.  How unethical can you get?  A 128 Gig memory card cost $120, so why does Apple charge $100 for 16?  With no slot for a memory card there is no way for me to store my videos and photos except to offload and onload through itunes.  When I am out in the field I have to carry my windows netbook around with me to make the ipad functional!  Utterly ridiculous!  Why, there isn't even a usb port to connect to a portable drive I could keep in my pocket!  Who came up with this asinine scheme?  And why should I have to offload and onload anything to make it work?  While the colors are bright and the graphics are nice and the buttons are easy to use, the dysfunctional operating characteristics of this tablet make it a very poor value.
!###Comes in handy n it's really helpfull and fun for the kids and road trips in the car where ever u go.                    First, I want to say that I only rated this at 2 stars due to the following... operation wise it worked well; we love the size and convenience, etc.This was/is our first IPad. And every other owner of an Iphone, IPod, Iwhatever... is aware that the glass/screen/digitizer can shatter pretty easily. I changed the digitizer on my 2nd Gen Ipod before and it was a breeze, so that's not a big deal or a big cost ($9 for the IPod touch) digitizer).Shortly after getting our IPad Mini the screen somehow cracked/shattered!!!! We have no idea how it happened and were of course irate. Knowing that the 'basic' warranty wouldn't cover such a repair, I look at how much the screen/digitizer costs (60-179 btw). I found one for around 60. The removal went ok...minus some added difficulty due to the shattered glass. BUT HERE's THE PROBLEM.The Home Button does not come with the digitizer and MUST be transferred to the new one if/when it has to be replaced!  The issue here is that this REQUIRES SOLDERING!!!! Search for it if you'd like: Ipad Mini Home button soldering.  Here's where it gets real bad/funny: all of the videos that I viewed never mention needing to replace the home button; they just show how to take it apart, and put it back together so I didn't think anything of it at until I reached that stage (too late!) So no I have to either find someone local who knows how to do this (no luck so far due to it being pretty new (and super difficult) or send it off and spend some $$$. Here's the best part.... the part that you have to solder the new digitizer to (a circuit) ISNT EVEN AVAILABLE TO PURCHASE SEPARATELY!!! So if anything happens to the super delicate wiring in the removal process, YOU CANT EVEN FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!What confuses me the most is that the ease of which their glass screens break is no secret and is not difficult to have happen.... SO WHY WOULD THEY MAKE IT SOOO DIFFICULT TO FIX ONE OF THE MOST COMMON PROBLEMS!?!?!So, if you have or get an IPad Mini and experience any issue dealing with the Home Button (not responsive, intermittent, stuck, etc.) or the digitizer/glass screen (not responsive, scratch, cracked, or shattered.... all which are fairly common... I wouldn't suggest doing this on your own and be prepared to open the wallet. Most online services offering to replace the digitizer are around $125.I hope that, maybe in the next generation, this is fixed/addressed. For something soo common, this needs to be a plug in solution...not having to find a specialist to solder it back together. My suggestion would be to 1) get a very durable/strong case (otterbox?) and 2) DONT USE THE IPAD UNTIL ITS IN THE CASE!!  ((our case was in the mail heading towards us...))                    It was a used IPad mini, and was connected to someone else's email account. Deal Station gave me suggestions on what to do to clear it, but since I had no idea who the previous owner was, I became very irritated that I couldn't activate the iPad mini. I returned it to Deal Station, and I am now waiting for my full refund.                    Bought for wife she lives it very much. I myself could care less about apple products being avid PC gamer/builder                    It's a small iPad without Retina.  Battery lasts.  Best thing about it really is how light it is.  Cheaper than full size.  Parent's like it for travel.                    I wonder if the screen is now not glass, but a thin plastic film how that will hurt Corning glass?Will this thin plastic film be used on new TV sets?A company called research frontiers controls the rights to controlling the effect on light passing through the plastic film and should benefit from this change .Refr is on the Nasdaq if you are interested. I own options on2'500 shares, and should be considered a person with a profit motive.                    It look like a new&#65292; but it still has some flaw&#65292; but it doesn't matter&#65292; it still looks good&#65292; I like it                    The ipad arrived scratched on the back and even a little bit also the screenThe ipad arrived scratched on the back and even a little bit also the screen                    i ordered a black one and recieved a white one, but its cool, not really a big problem (filter guidelines)                    The iPad mini is new and no opened. And seller send out the parcel very fast. Of course, the price is also very good.This is a gift for my friend. He is very happy to get it before he leaving.
!###what's not to love about an ipad... and the 32 GB seems better.  my daughter got he 16 and now wishes for more...                    Who wouldn't love to have an iPad?!? It links with my iPhone and work email/contact/caledar info. This was a great purchase. Everyone in the family has been enjoying it.                    Not being personally knowledgeable about this item, I ordered at the request of my grandson, and he is very pleased with this item.                    I've got to say, I LOVE iPad mini!!  I've used a regular-sized iPad, and I've go to say, this is WAY cuter, but also WAY more convenient!!!!!!  It's not too bulky to carry around all day, and it's got all the capabilities of the regular iPads.  LOVE!!                    I'm actually an android user, still prefer the android way. But this hardware is really something. Increadibly fast, very satisfied with the weight. ios7 is amazing.                    My wife got an iPad 2 as a gift. She has an iPhone as well so she let me use the iPad 2 and I was immediately hooked! The problem with with iPad 2 is it's too big and heavy. So I got myself an iPad mini it's much lighter and easier to lounge at the couch with.Also we have a small house so I thought maybe this could replace our PC. So now we no longer have a home PC. I can do everything I need with my iPad mini. Banking, surfing, bill paying, watch shows etc.Thank you Apple for the mini!It's much better than the regular old bulky iPad                    Regardless of the hype Microsoft has given their new Windows platform, the iPad is still the best. I bought the mini to replace my old iPad and after comparing tablets, I stayed with Apple. I love the mini for a number of reasons, primarily because of the operating system and ease of use. Windows is just not as good.                    I am a happy Apple fan. I have a MacBookPro & an iPhone 4S, 16 GB. A priority for me is having products that do what I want understandably, reliably & w convenient, knowledgable & quick tech support if needed. I have found Apple products are that way so didn't even consider any other brands.I find that the specs for this & the iPhone 4S are somewhat similar--processor, camera, etc & I got the 16 GB version for both.I was using my MacBookPro for business & to show a presentation at the table. But, while very light for a laptop, it still was big to carry around.I find that now I don't even turn on my Mac every day. I can browse email & the web & a lot of apps just fine on it.Since I'm new to the iPad, I wasn't sure just how useful it would be. Well it is. It makes a good e-book reader. Although only have a couple so far. I got the Kindle app since one e-book I wanted needed that format.I also is a very nice size to carry around w me. I got a new purse that is not large but has a pocket on the outside into which the iPad mini in its case just fits.I also like that I can do iMessages on all 3 of my devices & while I can do things on the iPhone, the iPad mini is much easier to read & type on.I bought the Belkin case at BestBuy that looks like a pad folio w snap in holder for the iPad. So its not totally obvious that its an iPad, looks nice & both protects & provides a nice stand for it that works well on table or on my lap.I'm also using my iPad mini rather than a hard cover bible for church, using the YouVersion app. The combo is agile enough to jump around to different passages & easier to carry.As one who is a touch typist, I was concerned about whether I would need an external keyboard, but have found that I can type pretty well on it. Not quite usual fingering--more like several finger typing but have been able to use it to take notes at seminars & meetings. This using the Pages app. I also have purchased the Keynote Ap thinking I would use it, but really use the free Slide Shark to handle a co presentation.  I'm thinking of purchasing the Numbers app. Need to review how to sync the Apple apps between the mini & my Mac.As far as connectors, don't have the myriad of Apple accessories that some are concerned about. I had previously gotten the InCase car charger from the Apple store for my iPhone (after the one I got at Walmart quit working after 8 mo). This is the kind that is in 2 pieces so one plugs into the car power outlet & then any usb plug can plug into it.  So if my iPad Mini needs charging, I can use its cord to plug into the outlet & charge in the car.Also, I bought it at the Apple Store & since I had One to One through my Mac, I could use it to learn my iPhone & my iPad. Unfortunately having recently moved to Portland, OR, the Apple Store is way across town so not as convenient as I was used to. Haven't been there yet. I need to go as sometimes I tap to close a Safari window or click on a link w no response. So should get the touch screen checked (as I did w the touchpad on my previous MacBookPro where they find certain portions not responsive & fixed it, quickly.Speaking of the Apple Store, I like the fact that I have that resource--even though now its less convenient than it was.  This is 1 reason that I like Apple products. If there is an issue,  I remember w other devices (Windows computers & Windows phone) where the service was not very good. My windows phone had major issues (couldn't properly handle daylight savings time & other issues). Verizon people were nice but didn't really help so got runaround & some never did get answers.  They knew a lot of basic stuff, but now w smart phones, they can't know all of them well.Also previously w a device from 1 co & OS from another & then other apps, I have gotten the run around w each blaming the other & being caught between them. Or maybe not even blaming the other but having to make multiple contacts to get an answer.I have found Apple Stores to be on top of things & their service turn around time is very fast--several times faster than they had promised.The other thing w Apple products that I have found is that they just work. I've had hardware & software failures w other computers & phones. I got my iPad Mini I think in early March. Working fine. My iPhone 4S is 22 mo old & working fine (they had to do a reset & upgrade to iOS6 1 time, quickly taken care of at the Apple Store).So for me, having products that do what I want, reliably & w tech support that quickly takes care of any issues that may arise is very important. I had not found that level of reliability & tech support w other products. I expect the same level of continued reliability & service if needed w my iPad Mini.                    Pros: Lightweight but solid-feeling.  Easy to hold in one hand.  Lots of cool apps at the App Store.  Operating system runs fast and rarely crashes.  Movies from Amazon Prime look awesome.  I have pretty much stopped using my PC now that I have this.Cons: High price- I got the 32 gig at Meijer when they were having 35% off if you open a charge account, otherwise I couldn't have afforded it.  Crappy sound through speakers, but ok with earbuds.  Rear facing camera not nearly as high quality as front facing camera.                    I love this mini-iPad. It's small enough to hold in one hand (as compared to the standard iPad) and yet big enough to actually see and use (as compared to my iPhone).I keep it next to my favorite chair so I can check and respond to email without having to go to my desktop computer.
!###I was very excited waiting for this product to come in. I paid just as much for it as I would have directly from apple, so I was not expecting any troubles. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I turn my new iPad mini on and the screen immediately begins flickering and has white streaks through the screen. Garbage. Absolute garbage. Also, this store is unable to do exchanges through amazon, so in order for me to get a working iPad, I now have to take the time to mail the defective one back, wait for the money to be put back on my account, and then place another order (from a different store obviously). I am extremely disappointed.                    I have to admit, I've started to become an Apple fanboy. After my poor experience with the Nexus 7 I went with the overpriced iPad. I love my iPhone, but wasn't looking to essentially get a bigger version of it (with a wi-fi only model). While they are very similar devices, I have found unique uses for my iPad. First off, there are an excellent selection of apps, a huge advantage the App store has over Google Play. I have one for taking handwritten notes, organizing my notes, performing sit ups, scanning documents, reading articles, books, and comics, utilizing Google Drive, dating and playing some games. Android devices have many of these features, but not the quantity or quality.The iPad itself performs well. Switching between screens and using the new iOS 7 changes have been fine. Of course, there are some changes I do not like, but that's not particular to this machine. I prefer the mini sized iPad versus the normal size for holding and travel. It's light and doesn't take up much space. The screen is wonderful for reading and takes decent pictures.Overpriced it is, I still think it's a great tablet. When the iPad was revealed years ago I couldn't imagine anyone wanting one. Now owning one I understand the appeal.                    Great product!!!BUT are you willing to purchase this from these sellers at a 20% price increase, when you can get it directly, which it will ship in 2 weeks, for $329 for the 16GB.  Currently Apple is shipping them in two weeks!  In addition, you can customize the ones you get directly from Apple... putting a name or some other custom phrase that would mark it as YOURS for free!!!!!I say, order from Apple DIRECTLY!!!                    I have long used Kindle products (and I mean from first one on the market) and loved them.  I had checked out iPad several years ago and felt that the Kindle Fire was much better.  Recently purchased an iPad mini with 4G LTE  from another vendor to be able to use for a specific purpose - but was very surprised at the changes that have been made to bring the iPad  up to the standards of the Kindle Fire.  I would recommend purchase of the iPad mini.  I gave it a 4 star rating instead of 5 simply because of the cost.                    i bought this as a replacement for my wife's ipad 2. at first she wasn't sure about it but after playing with it and seeing for herself how it surpassed her old ipad she just loves it.. &#34;it is a great size&#34; her words for reading, she uses it for school, work and the occasional netflix viewing.. great item for the individual who wants super portability with the right size screen for reading and more...
!###This was a surprise gift for my friend I is very satisfactory to her,but I prefer the regular size ones.                    This is great it is simple to use and there was a charger included in the box with it too                    It lasted just the time the company specify it will last to come. Apple isapple so theprodct should not me rated                    Not happy I have to find a place to find out what is wrong the sound is gone and it is moveing VERY slow!                    Esta perfecto, el tama&ntilde;o, la camara, lo puedo transportar facil, me gusto mucho, las aplicaciones pues ya saben geniales, comprenlo                    It seems to be ok. I didn't use it since I bought it for a present for my husband. It looks great                    Bought the iPad mini thinking it would be a lot different and faster than my IPad 1st gen. I was very disappointed. If you already own an iPad, it's not worth it. If you don't own an iPad, then go for it. But before here are some things to think about. I was disappointed that the screen had a lot of glitches. From the screen turning off an on, to freezing partial screen shots. I read a few Apple forums, it seems lots of people had these same problems, so it must be a common problem on this iPad. The camera is not so great, but does anyone really use it to take pictures? Anyway, I gave it two stars because 1. It's an iPad and 2. Because its an Apple product, and I love Apple. My suggestion for a person looking to investing an iPad, get a bigger one, and get any older generation. They're all pretty much the same. Yes your Internet page make take 2 seconds longer to load, but seriously, who is counting 2 seconds? And don't worry, the 4 extra ounces of weight isn't going to break your back. Here's an excellent article for a person that already owns an iPad: http://mashable.com/2013/11/01/ipad-mini-comic/                    I love my iPad Mini, However it does not charge properly part of the time. The cord seemed defective, so we took it to the Apple store to get a replacement. We were shocked to find out from the Apple employee that the charging cord that came in the box with my brand new{?} Apple iPad Mini bought from this seller is NOT an Apple product! So buyer beware! How does that happen ? Makes me question if the Mini was really new. It is past time for returning it, so I have no recourse but to write this honest review to tell others to beware of buying from this seller and if you do, check the cord included right away to see if it is in fact an authentic Apple product. I have never written a review, much less a negative one, but felt others should know about this discrepancy. My husband bought it from one of the higher rated sellers so this sort of thing wouldn't happen. Oh well!                    great product, regular battery duration, white color nicer, I would recommend it to buy it, I received my prouct very fast
!###My iPad one original died. Even the 'geniuses' bar couldn't revive it. I didn't know what to do. I was addicted. My only complaint with the original was that it was too big to handily fit on my person. The mini gave me that quality, and more. Additionally, it has 'Siri' and two cameras, which of course the original didn't. The price was half a replacement and all my old aps worked fine. It was easy to pick up where I left off, I just downloaded my latest back-up and it was like I had my original back with all the extra niceties mentioned above. It came overnight, I barely went through withdrawal.                    This is worth it. Plain and simple. RETINA or NO RETINA...who cares! I does exactly what I need it to do and its size and weight are the cherry on top. I only wish I would have bought the 32GB instead, but 16GB is doing me fine for the most part, just have to stream and email certain things instead. I think its for the best though, keeps me focused (which is why I bought this, for work mainly). But I love it!                    I've always loved the iPad, but never bought one for myself because it wasn't really portable enough. I'd rather just use my laptop or my iPod. But now my little iPad is the perfect medium-size for everything that I do. I was at first disappointed that it didn't have a Retina display (most likely will come out in a new model), but honestly I hardly notice. The screen is much sharper than the iPad 2 display. You only see the pixels if you look really hard, but from a normal viewing distance it is unnoticeable. I love my iPad, definitely recommended!                    After half-heartedly trying to get used to touch screen on an iPad (I found it too heavy to hold and use).  But when I got my hands on the iPad mini, well - what a difference.  It operates very close to the same way as the iPad, same apps, etc.  I don't like Mac Mail on the iPad, and have been looking for another email client that I can use with both iMac and iPad.  Tried to do this with Gmail and that was a total disaster.You can't carry the Mini in your pocket (too big) but it slips into any number of places in a carry on back pack, or just carry in your hand.  The picture isn't retina - but it doesn't make any difference at this size - the picture is fantastic.Beware that some of the Apps are cloud based (on any tablet), and when you are out of reach of wi-fi - you flat don't have the app!!!  I learned the hard way on a recent trip.  I don't maintain any phone based connectivity, so I bought this iPad mini with just wi-fi, and find that I don't have trouble finding a hotspot (I use Boingo, and it really helps).Small, but not iPhone small, light (much lighter than the iPad), great picture, tons of apps, great battery life - it is a winner.                    My daughter loves it....I was the best dad ever that day...lol.  She uses it all the time.  Perfect for that 25 and under gen.                    I own an iPad with Retina display but as portable as it is, I needed something just a little smaller that I could slip into my purse and pull out whenever I wanted to read a book.  I have been looking at the Kindle and the Nexus 7.  I was like two seconds away from snagging a Nexus 7 when I decided to research the iPad Mini.It seemed the better choice for me as my entire digital media library was on iTunes and I didn't want to have to rebuild it on another platform.  If you use the same iTunes account, all of your iOS devices sync up and you don't have to maintain libraries on multiple devices.I was surprised at the screen.  While not a Retina display, it is the iPad 2 screen resolution shrunk down in a smaller package, giving Retina like sharpness.I loaded up the Kindle app and I was in business!  I haven't found anything I can do on my full sized iPad that I can't do on the mini except full 1080p HD video, but It is hard to tell the difference on the smaller screen in 720p HD.The only negative I can see is that streaming video buffers a little slower on this device when compared to the full sized iPad, but that is just the differences in the hardware itself.I think this is a great unit for someone looking for full functionality in a more portable package.                    This size is so convenient, it could be taken anywhere.  The apps and other applications are quite informative and could be used by anyone.  Additionally it was very easy to set up.                    The regular iPad is great, I'm sure, but I wasn't really willing to spend $500+ on a tablet. This was much more affordable, and you get all of the same great features besides the size. Now, I know there are obviously other differences between the two, but coming from someone who isn't super tech savvy... it's basically the same. I love it! The only thing I would say isn't amazing is the sound. Sometimes it's not loud enough when I'm watching Netflix. That's it though! It's great!                    I like this iPad a lot. It is easy to put in your purse and take with you. I was worried it would be different and I would have a hard time picking up the differences from my laptop but it is very user friendly. I am 63 and only self taught on computer but I have no trouble using it. Great product.                    I lost my iPad and was ready for a mini anyway. So glad I got it.  Fast and easy to use.  I got the WiFi from AT&T and it is great in airports and other areas where no wifi is available.  With a logitech keyboard, I can take notes in classrooms and seminars with ease.  Highly recommend it.
!###This is what my 21 year old daughter wanted for Christmas....she is absolutely thrilled with this product.  Not only can she use this tablet for her entertainment, she can also use it for note-tsking in her college classes.                    Ok, so you may wonder, Apple only getting two stars!?  So, let me explain. With all the Apple hype out there, I expected this product to WOW me and out shine all the competitors, but it didn't.  Don't get me wrong. It's a good tablet, although it's beginning to feel a bit out dated amongst some of the up and comming competition.  The display is very good.  The speaker audio quality is decent, the display is very nice, but the OS is just ho-hum anymore.  One thing I really don't like is it's size.  You can't really hold the thing in one hand comfortably, and isn't that one of the reasons you buy a tablet smaller than the standard 10&#34; model?  Looking back I wonder if I would have been happier with the Samsung Galaxy Note 8&#34;.                    I bought this for my 6 year old daughter. She uses it all of the time. I've got a good case on it so that if she drops it, it will be protected well. It runs smoothly. It's easy to navigate. The screen is clear and sharp. She loves it. She plays games, takes pictures, watches TV shows on the Disney Channel. There is so much for her to do. It's definitely user friendly and after I set it up, she navigates it on her own with no help. I think I want one for myself.                    The iPad is ok most of the time some times it shuts down a game and goes back to the home screen but over all it's okay.                    First off the iPad mini is much smaller portable. The audio was very good compared to the Kindle which sucks and also you don't even need a Retina display the iPad mini has a very clear screen already. if you want something bigger you should get the iPad but for me I like something portable. Siri works great and writing this review was easy because I just had to voice.  So I think it's kind of big but I like it because kindle sucked and so I'm selling a piece of crap and that iPad mini is better                    I have been wanting an iPad for years, but never could afford one.  When the mini's came out, I finally was able to get one.  I love that this is just like my phone and so easy to use!  Also, I think I like this smaller version better.  It's so quick to load up and happy with all the available apps I can get.  The size is perfect to carry around with you too.  Just perfect!                    It's very good. Everything is perfect. it's cheaper and it has no tax. If i go to apple store, it will cost me more. so, this is good.
!###I just cant put it down. I want to carry it everywhere with me. It is the first iPad in my home and its the most excitement we had as a family over a gadget. Everyone wants one now. I own an iPhone 5 and iPod. I was never interested in an iPad because of size. I considered it to be a big iPhone and debated for months whether I should get an iPad 4 or the mini. I am so happy I got the mini. I really can't see that much difference with the retina. If fact my iPhone 5 looks so small and clustered. It is the best gift I have had since the iPhone. This iPad made me play games again. I stopped playing games on iPhone because of screen size.Pros:The size is perfect.The screen looks greatIt's fastWell madeHas great accessories i recommend Invellop leather case. It's perfect.Battery last long.1000s of great apps.It's Desirable.So far there is nothing that I would call a con.                    I have used Apple for time now. I was in graphic design & web design so Apple Macs great for productivity.Looking for big fun in mini size pad or gaming ipad mini is great. Is like a mini novel book.  Cause I like the idea of portable mini pad fits with the cases and the keyboard in my purse without hassle or extra "stuffing". I can pull out for my niece to watch videos or games on long car travel.I also note that it is a very great for those not familiar with tablets. It very user friendly. Snap it is so friendly my mother can use it and she's not a tech savvy.(recommend a stylus with a point not the ball for writing or drawing or presentation notes).My disappointment however if for my work/productivity. I purposely purchased to use with school and work. I am a teacher that has the interactive site or discovery programs. Major hit is the sites I need for the classroom that require Adobe FLASH support. Also it in my schooling  also requires Adobe FLASH support for my online courses/assignment. Sigh, every so a big block for me. Maybe I missed it that part in my research in Apple iPad Mini with Samsung Galaxy 10.  (oh the galaxy has flash support and already comes with programs as word, powerpoint, ect.)My next discovery  was how heavy I would more storage.My conclusion is based on your needs.                    This is my first iPad. I couldn't decide whether to get the regular size or the mini. So glad I got the mini, it fits much easier in my purse, etc. to take along. What did I ever do without an iPad lol I am so amazed at what all you can do with it and all the apps. and everything synchronizes with my iPhone wow. I guess I am just a middle aged person and this all amazes me.                    This Ipad is great.  It has met all my expectations.  It is light and can be taken everywhere.  The battery power lasts for a long time.  It was shipped in a timely manner. I am very pleased with my purchase and I highly recommend this mini IPad.                    Love my new mini iPad! Great for travel & the Grandkids! It's a Birthday to myself with a little help from my hubby.                    I Was waiting for this size of iPad is very confortable, fast and light weight, in my bed is nice to read, my daughter loves the sound when her music plays.                    I am in love!!! i orginally own a ipad 2 and loved it but it felt so heavy! i would ALWAYS leave my ipad 2 at home because it felt too heavy in my purse. 1 day i was out and had my ipad 2 with me and literally stopped what i was doing, drove home just to drop off my ipad 2 because it was hurting my shoulders.so when the ipad mini came out i couldnt wait to get it. but i didnt get it right away because after reading reviews many said it was no reason to upgrade from ipad 2 to ipad mini. but i kept thinking about the ipad mini because im like a tablet is made to be mobile not made to be for home use like a pcso i gave in finally and just got this ipad mini!! and i love it.  there is a difference of screen coming from ipad 2 to ipad mini nut you forget about it by feeling its weight. the ipad mini is soo much lighter than the ipad 2 ! i can now finally take my ipad mini with me in my purse and i dont feel the weight of it at allif you re unsure to get the ipad mini from a ipad 2 do it! you wont regret it.i have ios 7 beta on it and its lovely makes it feel like a whole new systemi take this ipad with me 90 percent of the time the only time i dont take it is when im not carrying a purse. it holds everything for me from my grocery list, to schedules, to movies to photos n etcwhen im out waiting i just pull out my ipad mini and im no longer bored!the ipad mini is a great investment go for it! and the reason why i didnt choose other tablets is 1. i already know apple products since i have an iphone n a macbook 2. although other tablets may be cheaper i dont have patience or nerves for there flawsi brought my mother a tablet another brand and just to set it up for her i hated it. the screen was soo not responsive i had to tap so many times that my fingers hurt. a tocuh is suppose to be that, touch screen and easy to touch and apple has that which why i think its more pricer.anyhow im enjoying my ipad mini and i wish i didnt take so long to get it. its the 1st thing i pic up when i wake up and the last thing before i go to sleepi love it and you will too                    This is an iPad 2 on steroids. It's smaller, but faster, has a better camera, and has Siri. Lightweight, fits in a purse or cargo pocket, makes a great GPS device for driving because you can actually see the items on the screen, due to its larger size than any dedicated GPS device. But you'll need a SIM card for live guidance. Otherwise you'll need to plot your course while on wireless somewhere and pull up the saved directions on the way. Or tether it your cell phone if you're able to.This is a great size for kids because its lightweight and the smaller form factor makes it easier for little hands to manage.                    I love it. It has everything my iPad  has and more.  It's lighter too.. No regrets. I am an Apple lover.                    I have an Apple iPad MC707LL/A (64GB, Wi-Fi, Black) 3rd Generation, iPhone 4S, Apple iPod touch 16GB Black/Silver (5th Generation) NEWEST MODEL, and a Apple TV MD199LL/A which through AirPlay integrates programming and iTunes onto my TV.So why buy the iPad mini?For me it was the 5mp iSight camera (1080P video capable), screen size and portability.  The iSight camera takes fantastic photos, and through Photo Stream (enabled on your device) you are able to share up to 1000 photos with others on your network. (Beautiful video quality too!  Get the Action Movie FX app to have a lot of fun posting to Facebook.)  The iPod touch 5th does have the iSight camera too, but a 4" screen, which for me is a tad small to see and edit photos as I would like to do.The mini's 7.9" screen size is very functional for 'on the go' email, photo viewing, games and makes reading my Kindle books (free Kindle app available) much more enjoyable.Overall dimensions of the device make it very slim and lightweight, making slipping it into my purse or backpack a breeze.Height:7.87 inches (200 mm)Width:5.3 inches (134.7 mm)Depth:0.28 inch (7.2 mm)Weight:0.68 pound (308 g)The Apple iPad mini pairs easily with Bluetooth devices like keyboards and headsets too.  I don't really see the point in pairing with a keyboard, as with this screen size typing up a term paper is possible - but not likely.  However, pairing with a stereo Bluetooth headset to enjoy a movie or listen to music works really well and makes for fun entertainment during the morning commute. (Assuming you're not driving!)Facetime (720P) works well on the mini, as does emailing - assuming you have a solid Wifi connection; 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi (802.11n 2.4GHz and 5GHz). NOTE: Many apps and functions of all iOS devices, depend upon Wifi to be enabled and to have a solid connection before they will work correctly.Good news for anyone who wants to enjoy this device.Like the iPad, the mini has accessibility features that allow users with disabilities to use the device.  Including...VoiceOver screen readerGuided AccessSupport for playback of closed-captioned contentAssistiveTouch interface for adaptive accessoriesFull-screen zoom magnificationLarge textOption to invert colorsBuilt-in apps get you started enjoying the mini right out of the box, without having to download apps.  They include...Safari - web browser that's fast and has Google set by default.PhotosApp Store - make sure you have your Apple ID ready to grab free and paid apps.Maps - turn on location in settings to use Wifi for directions.Photo BoothReminders - useful for keeping yourself on track.CameraMailFaceTime - a great alternative to Skype.iTunesMusic - sync with your PC or Mac and make sure 'sync' is checked when you do to upload your music to your device.ClockCalendar - integrates with MS Outlook 2010.Messages - send text, voice or photos to others with 'i' devices, and save on cellular data fees!NewsstandVideosGame CenterContacts - use iCloud to store your contacts, messages, emails, photos and do back-ups.  *Free 5GB of iCloud is yours!NotesSECURITY APP TIP: get the free 'Find My iPhone' app (works with iPads too...) and set up a passcode to limit access to your settings so that this app cannot be disabled should your device be stolen or lost.  By using this free app you are able to locate the device (a general area) when it connects to the Internet.  You can also disable the device so that if stolen, it's not going to be 'enjoyed'!Students, commuters, frequent travelers, and gadget lovers will adore the iPad mini for it's highly portable fun and functionality.Those seeking a tablet for working on spreadsheets or writing a novel, go get an iPad instead.iPad mini cases I like...OtterBox Defender Series Hybrid Case for iPad Mini - Black (77-23834) - for those who want extra 'bump' protection!  The only negative to this one is no 'magnetic' sleep function because it doesn't have a cover, it has a built-in screen protector instead.Snugg iPad Mini Leather Case Cover and Flip Stand with Elastic Hand Strap and Premium Nubuck Fibre Interior ('Distressed' Brown) - Automatically Wakes and Puts the iPad Mini to Sleep - fits well, looks good, and has the sleep/wake feature via a magnetic closure. Well padded, but it doesn't provide the same 'bump and drop' protection as the Otterbox Defender.
!###I'm a big Apple fan and have had all the iPhones. I currently have the iPhone 5 so I decide, after a lot of research. to go with the iPad Mini. After giving it a full charge I started running it thru its paces, registering and getting all my favorite Apps loaded. Then I started to notice that I was losing battery very quickly. An average of 1% every 2 minutes. So I went into settings and did all the tricks; lower brightness, turned off notifications, manual email receive, etc.. Even though it did improve slightly it was not dramatic. I was also noticing that it was slow and had quite a bit of lag compared to my iPhone 5. I ran some video and it was constantly buffering. So I did some speed test across my WiFi and found it was running at about half the speed of my iPhone 5 and laptop. So I decided to do a hard reset,  bleed the battery to zero, then charge it to 100% and then reload everything. Well the charging took forever but I figured this was the first time to zero and back so I'll give it a chance. I started loading it back and had all the same issues. Bummer. So I opened a case with Apple. They are excellent BTW. After the basic testing and trouble shooting Apple decided that they would start by replacing the battery. But I decided rather than continuing to put in a lot of extra time trying to get this unit to work for me I would just return it. Amazon was great with the return process. I give them 5 stars. Apple support was great. I give them 5 stars. My particular iPad Mini. 1 star. Hopefully it was just a fluke bad unit.                    Would not have purchased the WiFi-only version if the ads and specs had made it clear that even though it does have a GPS, it only works with location-based apps if the WiFi is on.                    The product works great I enjoy using it for my business and personal use. It is an asset to what I'm trying to accomplish                    Apple does it AGAIN! You can buy a Samsung 7&#34; tablet for a lot less and of equal quality. I have an Ipod 5 that does most everything this Mini does. If you need portability, get an Ipod.-5. If you want an Apple tablet, get an Ipad. Apple has the most apps but their competition is quickly drawing up behind them. If you are considering the brand, get other products. If you are considering the price, there are many good competitors for less money. You will have to worry less about the time when Apple will stop supporting its older products in order to force you to buy the newest and latest. I am as loyal to Apple as Apple is loyal to their customers. They make good products with many apps, but are not there for us in the long term.                    My daughter loves her IPad mini.  She text me all the time and I didn't have to get involved with buying her a phone!                    Received my Apple iPad Mini late last week. The learning curve, even for someone who is not a computer nerd, turned out to be fairly short. There are some features still to learn but I'm now up and running quite happily (even wrote a blog post). I added a case and peripherals since I'm an avid photographer and also a writer who wants to be able to use the mini for editing and writing while traveling or cafe-ing. I purchased the Logitech Ultrathin keyboard and the UXWrite app (uses Word and Dropbox to work between computer and iPad). Also, for photo downloading: Apple Lightening readers for memory cards and camera direct. If you only take pics with your iPad or iPhone you don't need this. Since the nearest Apple store is 280 miles round trip I researched and ordered everything through Amazon and it was all efficient and quick. And, oh yes, it fits in a medium-sized handbag!                    os produtos foram entregues no prazo e chegaram muito bem armazenados.quanto ao site ta de parab&eacute;ns pela organização dos produtos e facilidade de rastrearo andamento da entrega..                    the product was great everything i was especting, definitely recommended for all you guys who realy need it have fun                    I bought this for Christmas gift for my son and he loves the product.  It's like IPad 2 with smaller size.  Portable and good.  But so over priced.  This is the only issue I have.  I bought it a lot more than the normal price and my friend just bought 8 inch tablet with better spec than the Ipad Mini from Idolian called Mini Studio for less than $200 and it works better than IPad mini.  :-(I'm getting the Mini Studio for my daughter for her birthday since it's a lot more affordable.  But IPad is IPad!  Great!                    Pure quality built product. Looks great and is  the coolest tablet out there. Super light. Display is excellent and apple maximized its screen to have very little border which is a plus.  Battery life seems decent. Processor speed seems to be quick. Able  listen to music and have other programs going.I have another tablet HTC evo 4g tablet and it is also a great tablet. So, I am comparing the mini iPad to that. The size is much better than the full sized iPad. However, it is just a little too big for my hand to hold comfortably for long periods. My HTC is much better sizing in that respect. Also, it is a little slippery but nothing a silicone sleeve can't handle. My biggest gripe is that it doesn't have text reflow and the text starts out tiny in the browser.  The android os leads in that category because no matter how large the text is magnified it reflows to fit the screen. Apple products need a true text reflow. Also, I like how you can customize android's screens in regard to icons and widgets. The mini iPad is is lacking in that area.All in all it is a great tablet and built to high quality standards.
!###The first few days we were very frustrated because we were new to apple technology and we couldn't get anything to work.  With a little time to work it out and some help from friends, we are comfortable with it.  Now we fight each other for time on it.                    I LOVE IT!!! IM ON IT RIGHT NOW!!  :D Works great, my new BEST FRIEND!Was fast delivery. Was exactly what I ordered. I have absolutely no complaints. I would recommend this seller, as well as use them again!!                    Great I love this for my daughter, it's the right  price set hands down, apple has done it again again and again                    Great product also purchased otter box defender with it, perfect match !! Resolution is just as good as regular iPad but fits perfectly in a good size purse.  As always, great amazon service !!!!                    If u don't have a ipad mini u better get one cause it something good to have..... the best and u will love it..                    Very happy with my iPad Mini!  I found it to be all that I had dreamed and much, much more.                    It acomplished my expectationsI love ipad mini and the price was good because it was out of sell at all apple stores.                    Well this ipad mini is nice - clear bright screen, every bit as nice as a full sized ipad.  Except the wi-fi.  I got this to save my back - so I wouldn't have to carry my laptop to work.  But I'm pretty disappointed in the wi-fi.  It has less connection ability than my husband's kindle fire.  The only way I can use it at work, or even in the bedroom at home, is to use my iphone as a mobile hotspot.  It will not and can not connect to my home network or work network - doesn't seem to have the connection range as the kindle fire or my laptop.  If I hadn't already &#34;moved into&#34; it, I'd be returning it.  I am not happy with the very limited connection range.
!###The best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I love it  Dose not crash at all  Worth it people  :).  Its its its.  It is jailbreaking fun.  I dont make any sense SORRY                    Hi the I pad mini is the best tool/PCM out thereWorks fine looks new 64gb is a lot of space to put all my stuff onThank you again                    I bought this for my 8 year old son and he never gets to play with it- the whole family enjoys playing with the iPad mini                    as expected, my son is enjoying his IPad Mini, fit our expectation and will recommend to anybody, thanks Amazon we are enjoying it                    Me encanta mi ipad es genial se las recomiendo es comoda y muy util me ha servido para muchas cosas                    I'm so excited my iPad came so quick I got it the next day although the case wasn't ready to be sent I so appreciate that my main order was still sent out super quick faster than I expected and packaged very well. My kids use it more than I do until I get used to it at least but I love all the free games that are available for my 6 and 11 year old as well as books. It keeps them super entertained in the car or keeps them off the tv :) I am lovin it and slowly becoming addicted to amazon.......thank you very much                    The device is easy to use. I use it for educational purposes. I use iBooks for textbooks.  The app store to supplies plenty of choices for educational games for my children. I use the iPad to help coordinate my homeschool.The device is worth the money! I waited a long time to make this purchase and am very satisfied. Excellent graphics, super quick response, love the gestures capability!                    Fun use it every day in it I I I iiii I I I I I I I I I I I                    This slightly smaller version of the ipad is perfect for being held in one hand while typing with the other.  It has everything the big ipad has except retina display - and I haven't missed that at all on this little baby.  I take it with me everywhere because it is my connection to the world, my business, blog, calendar, camera, pictures, notes, grocery lists, video camera, voice recorder, Holman's study Bible (and two other Bibles), current books I'm reading, online classes, and this list could go on and on for pages!  I thought about this purchase forever before I made it because I hate buying something and then regretting in after I get it.  With the  Apple iPad Mini (32GB) - I have NO regrets!
!###Yes, it doesn't have the retina display but for my uses it doesn't make a lot of difference. Form factor and mobility sold it for me and I couldn't be happier with it.                    I must say that when iPads came out in general I saw no use for them and I am an Apple lover. When I first viewed these in the store, I thought wow it's so small! I must say that now that I've purchased one, it truly is the perfect size. The other one seems too big now! Lol. I will say that it is a bit tough trying to type in landscape mode, but it is doable.Great product.                    A lot easier to use than I expected. it almost does it all! Compact and versitile, battery life is exceptional. I don't know how I managed without it                    I did a lot of research before purchasing the iPad Mini Wi-Fi, and I'm really happy with it--it's exactly what I wanted!                    I have had several nexus phones, currently using the nexus 4. I have the MacBook Air 11 which I love. Was using blackberry tablet, but found it lacking. The iPad 3 is great but cumbersome to lug around. The mini is just the right size.This mini is so superior to the nexus 7, that it makes the 7 feel junky. This renders the web pages faster. The NHL program I use is smoother on the mini than the Nexus, this despite the Nexus having a faster CPU.Highly recommended. Barely fits in my lab coat at work, but at least it won't easily fall out.Battery life while still new, is exemplary.Highly recommended.Higher quality material and OS than the competition.                    Apple has done it again. This tablet is productivity heaven. Every AP is fantastically utilitarian. It has excellent wireless capabilities. The settings are fairly easy to manage. I love using I Tune U for taking college classes for free. Every AP works well unlike other operating systems, there are rarely any glitches. The battery last long even with constant use. The updates are not obstructive in nature. Every time I put it down I can't wait to pick it back up. I also like the fact that I can use Sprint data plan on a month to month bases and it's prorate if I only use a percentage of the allotted amount. So far there seems to be no cons to speak of.  I highly recommend this item.                    The mini is samller than the original, but is easier to use and handle.  Love the facetime feature along with video camera.                    Does everything the big bulky does in a nice compact size.  Fits in my coat pocket.  Absolutely recommend this over any tablet!                    I love APPLE products for one, and I really love my new iPad mini.  Easy to just put in my purse and go.  With my laptop, it's like packing a small suitcase.  Battery life is great.  I would recommend his over the standard larger iPad just due to the more compact size, weight and user friendly.                    Apple is setting the tone for future products. This iPad mini is one such product. Fast as ever,get on line in a nano second. If your a serious thinker get the 64 gig. You can't lose. Perhaps consider an open box one as I did. I saved about 80.00. Since it  was an open box I checked with apple about it. You can bye an extended warranty 99.00 only if its been purchased with in 29 days. They check the serial number. Then register it in your name. The place where I bought mine was JayBrokers.com. It came to me just about brand new. Jaybrokers is a 3rd party therefore you don't pay tax. Plus amazon will give you free shipping. Go for the open box and save. It's a risk but you really can't lose. Jonathan RV
!###I have had my mini for over a month now and I still love it as much as the first day I bought it. I did drag my feet a bit b4 purchasing because of all &#34;talk&#34; about the lack of a Retina display. I can tell you without hesitation that this has never bothered me in the least and yes I have another device with a Retina display. If you are holding back like me because of all the hyperbole about the absence of one your missing out on an awesome device.Pros:Battery life is amazingPortability factor (I take it with me everywhere and it has never been a chore)Screen (yes despite it not being Retina it is superbly clear)Everything else with the one exception noted below.Cons:No flash for the camera.                    I have received my mini really fast, in 7 days from the purchase, on APOE, in perfect condition, well packed. As no one mentioned this or I have not found a review to state this, I wish to make the mention that at the moment I am using my mini with an Etisalat SIM card and it works like a charm on 3G, so the AT@T mini is not carrier locked, information useful for the non-US buyers. Very proud with my mini, the display, even if is not "retina" is great, beyond expectations. Enjoy your mini's.                    iPad's are, as you would expect any Apple product to be, Excellent.  Superior in every way; design, craftsmanship, ease of use, and of course the apps.  The iPad mini which I own satisfy s all my tablet needs.  Look no further.                    Love it so much I traded my android phone in for the iPhone 5!  Fits in my purse. Great response time. Awesome picture and sound.                    The same great functionality and applications of iPad in a perfect size.The smaller display is enought for most tasks and much better to read on bed or to carry for a meeting.                    I love the mini. It's so compact and easy to use. Might get one for my 2 year old. She loves fruit ninja!!                    I really love my Ipad mini.  It is lightweight and small enough to carry in my purse.  I take it everywhere.                    I am just now on the cusp of what this thing can do. The best part is that I can hold it and type at the same time. It fits in my purse, and it runs FAST! Never have had any issues with it, and I've had it since Christmas.                    Convenient. Highly recommend! Fits in purse but bigger than phone so easier to read than iPhone. Cheaper than iPad! I cloud for family calendar sinc.                    So much better than the standard iPad! The form factor of the Mini is exactly what I have been waiting for, and it will be a gadget that I will keep for a long time. If it breaks, I'll get another one!
!###Love it, its super awesome mini ipad, very utility thing i use in every meeting i have, new, good condition                    as expected fly away with speed and color is beautifulrecommendedas usual good products from apple .....usage 1 month ans still happy                    m'y soon he love it, it's fast and esy to used apple ipad mine 32gb wi-fi is good investement happe.                    I got this ipad for my partner who is traveling. It's perfect. Love the 4G option and especially love Facetime - the easiest way to stay in communication from long distance. I have the ipad2 & love it but I'm going to upgrade to the ipad mini myself with the next version for the better camera & smaller size.                    Arrived quickly. Price was great for 32G. Bought this for my son's college graduation-he hasn't put it down yet! Does everything he wants without having to drag out his big laptop! Wonderful purchase!                    I love my iPad mini!  It is great for games and music.  I use it all the time.  The browser is good.  Unfortunately there are some things I still have to use the laptop for.  But, I love my mini!                    This is an execelent apple product, I think it's the perfect size, you can take it anywhere. It met my expectation                    Product was brand new as advertised. Love the mini ipad. It has become my go to device. Would certainly recommend.                    I love it.Despite its humble specifications it performs very well.Deducted 1 star because I find the memory options expensive.                    Bought it for my daughter.  she loves it  It should last for a long time because of the amount of memory I bought.  I hope/
!###I held off buying the Mini because of all the reviews that rated my Google Nexus 7 tablet as far superior, but now that I have both, I believe it's the Mini that is better.  I think they are both great but here are the key deciding factors:For Mini:Screen size is better...you can see more without scrollingFor web browsing, it doesn't  default to mobile pages, always showing full sized pages which I preferGlass surface feels better to tap (strange but true)Charges much faster and charger fits more snugly into deviceHolds charge for a longer timeAgainst Mini:Screen resolution is crisper on Google Nexus 7Web pages load slightly faster on Google Nexus 7 in my side by side testSo while both are excellent, for me the Mini is better!                    I am very disappointed with the Sprint network.  Though I live right in the middle of San Antonio, I cannot connect with Sprint's vaunted LTE network from my home.  Worse, Sprint's antiquated CDMA network architecture isn't used in the rest of the world so connecting for updates overseas is impossible.  I should have gone with AT&T as the carrier.  My GSM networked iPhone works in the UK, the middle east, and in Africa no problem, while my iPad is totally disconnected.  You will only realize how big a problem this is when you discover how many apps won't work unless they are connected to a cellular network.  Sprint is a big mistake. Should have done more homework because their cheaper data plans don't make up for their network architecture shortcomings.  True enough, the iPad works fine when connected with WiFi, but outside the U.S. WiFi networks remind me of 300 baud modems -- &#34;you are now connected to the world wide wait&#34;.Another problem with the iPad is the inability to import photos using an Apple supplied SD card reader that plugs into the mini's Lightning port.  Turns out, Apple has got the iPad software so locked down that the card reader won't function with an SD card from anything other than the simplest point and shoot camera.  If you use a good Nikon, Canon or other high end Digital SLR camera that stores jpg files in separate folders you can forget about importing your photos directly into an iPad.  Great job, Apple!                    First off the advertising that was sent out on this device said over "275,000 Apps to choose from" that is incorrect - as I found out calling Apple tech support one day.Although they say they will "eventually" make them available to the mini - I believe it to be false advertising myself.Next is the considerable failure on its connectivity to anything other than a mac pc, I have had to remove apps, photos and music and had to reinstall them over more than once - without an explaination from Apple support this takes considerable time.Overall its more sleek and compact than the larger version of the IPAD - but for the amount of headache I've had from it - it will be sometime before I ever buy from Apple again.Their are certainly better and less expensive tablets on the market - ones that you will not have to pay extra once the battery life gives out on your IPAD - guess thats one way Apple can keep its "loyal" customers.                    The ipad mini was just like new in very excellent condition. It was delivered very fast. I use the Ipad on a daily.                    Like the convenience of the mini. It has been all that I expected.  The size meets my needs.  Battery life has been fairly good.                    I am very much pro iPad.  I owned a 1st and now a 4th generation standard versions.  As a tablet there is no better choice.I recently tested out the mini, and while it has all the same amazing features as the standard, I have to say I do not prefer the smaller size.  I get that people need something more portable, and for you this might be a great choice.  I however use mine for watching videos when I am out and about, so I found myself missing the screen size.If you need something more portable and just smaller, then get this, otherwise go get the 4th generation iPad.  Honestly though, either way you will be happy.                    I received my iPad mini on Sept. 20.  I had a software question so I contacted Apple Support for help.  They told me that my 90-day Apple new-buyer support had already terminated.  They said it had already been registered 3 months earlier by someone else.  That tells me that I was sent a used iPad and was charged a new iPad price.  Now I cannot use Apple Support if I have a problem in the next 90 days.  Also, my 12-month warranty has been reduced to 9 months.  I feel somewhat cheated and I hope this doesn't happen to another customer.  Next time I will buy Apple products from the Apple Store.                    The iPad Mini manufactured by Apple has been the best purchase I have made so far in electronics. A 7.9 inch display touch screen, my iPad Mini is white but it is also available in black glass from and a aluminum back. It has cameras built in the front & back. The way it sounds when it plays music its great, its very loud but it also has an headphones jack build in so when you want to listen to music just to yourself. This device is so easy to carry around it only weights 10.9 ounces compared to other device that is very lite, its almost like your caring just a lite reading book. It has other great features like over 275,000 apps to download from the app store, Face Time where you can video call someone from any other Apple device and much more. Compared to other tablets like the Galaxy Tablet 2, Kindle Fire and even the iPad 2 that's manufactured by the same company I think the iPad Mini is the best. Starting with the Galaxy tablet, it has some features that are the same as the iPad Mini but not all. The Galaxy Tablet 2 is manufactured by Samsung it has a 10.1 screen, its a black colored tablet, weights 1.28 lbs that's 0.59 pounds more than the iPad mini. The only good thing it might have better than an iPad mini it is its battery lifetime, an iPad mini can hold up to 10 hours and an Galaxy Tablet 2 holds up to 14 hours. Every other feature the iPad has better. Second tablet to compare the iPad Mini to is the Kindle Fire. The Kindle is a 8.9 in display screen, it weights 20 ounces, storage varies on amount you want from 16GB to 32 GB. While iPad had an storage amount that goes from 16GB to 64GB this shows that the iPad has more storage available than the Kindle. Yes it has a few similarities as the iPad mini but the app store in the kindle is not the best, it has a few selections to choice from. Another thing to know about the Kindle is that this tablet is more of a online book reading tablet. Third tablet to compare it to is the iPad 2, a tablet that was made by the same manufacturer. An iPad mini is better than the iPad two in many different ways. One example is its weight the iPad mini weights 10 ounces while the iPad 2 is weighting at 1.22 pounds. Less weight is always better, you don't want to carry a device that's to big because then you'll get tired faster. The manufacturer comes up with an improvement in their tablets for a reason. The iPad mini came out after the iPad 2 but was a better success. Another example is Sire If you don't know what that is Siri is a feature that lets you use your voice tell it to do things like send messages, place phone call and other things. Size was a big change in the manufactures design in the iPad mini, they made it smaller and more portable for the buyers.  As you can tell the iPad mini is a better and improved tablet that apple manufacture has build after iPad 2. I have purchased the iPad mini and I'm so happy that I've purchased such a wonderful device. I've had such bad experience with tablets. They either are too big, heavy and there aren't much apps to choose from. But I've had best experience with this device it is so easy to work, I have many apps to choose from and its very lite to carry. I totally love the camera pixels, my pictures and videos are so clear. I paid a little bit over $300 dollars for my iPad mini but it was worth every penny. I recommend anybody that is going to buy a tablet to get an iPad mini. I know for a fact they will not regret it because I don't. This iPad mini is with me at all times and it's useful. I take it with me to class, its features let me take notes and save them when I don't feel like writing them on paper or when I don't have a utensil to write with. When it comes to me to remembering things I'm not the best at. But being able to use the iPad mini's Calendar is useful, I can type in reminders of events or anything that needs to be done on a certain day to remind me. There is so much that you can do with the iPad mini that its so amazing. I remember when I was running to class late I was rushing putting things in my backpack not realizing that I had forgot the most important thing for that class, the reading book. I arrived to class, I sat down I began taking out my things that's when I realized that I forgot my book on my bed. I didn't know what to do the teacher was very strict on being prepared for class, she didn't like people sharing books. As I was pulling my iPad mini I thought about an idea. I turned on my WiFi and began to browse the internet looking for an online book I was able to find one. I was so happy the iPad mini saved me. If it wasn't for that iPad mini I would have been lost in class and the teacher would have made me look like a fool in front of the class if she would have seen me not participating and not having a book. Thank you iPad mini.                    I purchased the iPad Mini for myself for relatively light gaming, and school purposes as I am a college student. I have to say, I am very pleased with this product as it is perfect for a student who is constantly on the go, like myself. It&#8217;s thin, light weight, and very portable. It fits perfectly in my purse (even with a Defender Series Otterbox on it) and keeps its charge through my school day MUCH better than my laptop!The only minor drawback is, if you&#8217;re like me and have an iPhone, you&#8217;re going to see a noticeable difference in the crispness of the display. I never had a regular sized iPad, but from what I understand, the reason the images aren&#8217;t as perfect is because the iPad Mini doesn&#8217;t have the retina display. Again, to me this was a really minor drawback, and it doesn&#8217;t change my 5 star rating. I also had a strange problem getting my iPad Mini to connect to my Apple iTunes account so I could use iMessage and FaceTime. The problem somehow solved itself about 24 hours after activating it&#8230; Not sure what the problem was, but it hasn&#8217;t been an issue since.I also just updated it with the new iOS 7 software, and it looks and operates perfectly! No glitches so far, and it&#8217;s looking like there won&#8217;t be any!I would definitely recommend this product to college students who - like me - are tired of carting around their laptops, only to have the battery die in the middle of class!                    I bought this as a surprise for my wonderful husband and he simply loves it and has not put it down since it was delivered
!###I bought the mini as a gift for my wife.  She loves it.Why the mini? Because it ergonomically better v.v. less fatigue when hand held, particularly for users with smaller hands.  The CPU responsiveness is good, the screen is sharp with crisp refresh, networking is a cinch to set up, and touch controls while seemingly  less sensitive than a large screen do afford good digital resolution.My wife has been using the iPad at home and on the job.  When used at home, she scans the news and researches topics for future lessons.  At work, she as example used a clever wave motion app to demonstrate physical principles of wave motion to her students.  Predictably, a third of her students had downloaded the app onto their iPhones within 5 minutes ... that's engagement! And, that she's using the iPad to demo scientific principles in the classroom ... very cool per her students.I think this gift earned a few extra brownie points, or at least one get out of the doghouse credit.                    Fast, simple, smart, fun, lightweight, dont have Bad luck but have a cloud no the top!This buy is a gift of my mother in your birthday... She have 60 years and she hope learn your emailsIn the ir romm.Se open the box, setting the ipad, connetct the wifi... And enjoyTahonas steve jobs...                    It is all I need. I am loving it. I wish I could have gotten one sooner.. the graphic are wonderful. Thank You                    Nuff said, right?It's an iPad...but mini....perfect size actually...not too big, not too small...I use it for business...works great!                    The iPad mini is a must have.  Hands down.  It is beautiful, aesthetic, easy to use, and intuitive.  There are more than 300,000 apps designed specifically for it and they work beautifully on the high resolution screen.  While it is not Retina, this does not make it any less of a good screen.  It is crisp, clear, and responsive.  The fact that it fits in one hand also ads a level of portability to it that the iPad 4 does not offer at this point.  It is extremely light and thin, as well.  Overall, its aesthetic and simple design, thin and light architecture, and wonderful screen make it a must buy for future tablet owners.                    Why would you settle for something that "might" offer a similar quality or user experience?  I tried a Nook tablet and really disliked it.  I got the iPad mini 16GB Wi-Fi black version for Christmas.  I've been using it a couple months and couldn't be happier.  It performs flawlessly.  The graphics and screen are on-par with any other tablet I've seen.  The one flaw people point out with the iPad mini is the non-Retina display, but I find no fault with the screen.  I have had every iPhone and an iPad 2 and the iPad mini is my favorite Apple product yet.  I don't need the bigger screen of the iPad 4.  I would say anyone desiring a tablet should just go with the best and avoid issues with the complexity of Android or small app market with Nook or Amazon.                    I've purchased this for doing some reading. I have a lot of material in PDF and I wanted to have a good tablet to read on, this is a really awesome tablet for doing that. About the screen, is true, is not a retina display but it doesn't suck at all you can do reading and everything you want to without any kind of issue because of the screen resolution. The apple integrated apps for doing reading and other stuff are really great, the iBook app is awesome for reading PDF you don't need to download anything else is right out of the box. The only problem that I had is that I own a Galaxy SIII and is really shocking how closed an limited you feel when you go from android to iOS, the system is not open at all, is like apple already limited the user to use the tablet the way they want you to use it and not the way you want to use it, you cannot download any material (music, videos, etc) directly from the internet, if u want to do that u can download it from your computer and transfer it to your ipad using itunes. EVERYTHING you want to do you have to doing from itunes, that's the downside. On the other hand the tablet is simply beautiful, super light, super well constructed, super comfortable to use I can't get tired of using it.                    El iPad Mini me parece espectacular, muy intuitiva, con el tama&ntilde;o exacto com para leer mientras viajo, la pantalla perfecta para navegar en internet.Lo recomiendo, sobre todo para las personas que viajan.                    The only issue I've found is the battery doesn't last as long as I'd hoped! Have to charge it often... & since I use it a lot it's kinda inconvenient :))                    This product totally met my expectations. Way to go Apple. The size is just perfect and allows me to easily use my fingers to interface with the device whilst holding with both hands.
!###Thank you very much for this ite, (Apple IPad Mini). This product is excellent and useful, and I highly recommend this seller. Thanks a lot.                    I waited a long time to buy a tablet, and after much research I chose the IPad mini Wifi only. I use it everyday and it works great.                    Got it a month ago and yesterday the infamous apple flashing logo, tried several times to restore but just 2001 error appeared, tomorrow I'm going to change it for a new one, will had to wait for 10 day aprox. because I'm in Bogota.                    **Disclaimer: I WON my iPad Mini but I paid for the $100 memory upgrade ***Having said that, I've paid thousands of dollars for my Mac products over the years. I was on the verge of splurging on this one too. So the review makes no difference.A solid 5 star. I went from 1st generation big heavy iPad to this. And I AM LOVING IT.The weight: Heavier than a Kindle but only slightly so. It's perfect to throw in your purse, to read books, to do email and to watch movies and videos.Screen: Quality of the screen, the colors, the text, it's high tech, top notch and even over the top gorgeous.Battery life: So far so good. I've had it for weeks, charged only once, been using it 2-3 hours a day some days a lot less.... it varies.For reading books, it's great but I tend to read PDF documents here and still read my major books on the Kindle but of course you can switch on your Kindle app and keep reading on the iPad.Love the size and weight the most. So glad to own this little puppy. >SPLURGE. You live once, you deserve it and no, Apple doesn't pay me a dime to say that but they really should ;)!PS: The only thing that bugs me is the cable connector. Did Apple really have to change the connector type? Are they really that much of a jerk to screw up a perfectly good system and create so much waste from unusable cables .... for what??? Idiots! The things we must put up with to have our Apple products.I am an Apple product fan, not an Apple company fan, as you can see!                    iPad Mini Review from a non apple fanboy, As the title says! I've used Apple and Android cell phones, tablets, windows and apple Computers and (Linux). I'm very pleased with my purchase of the iPad Mini, It's everything I wanted and nothing I didn't. It's cheaper then the full sized one, it's smaller, it's easy to hold, theres tons of apps like with all iOS Devices, The battery lasts a good amount of time, the screen is very bright, the speakers are well built in ones but at that there very good, I'd recommend buying the Apple smart cover it makes that iPad you bought that much better, I've had it since day one and it's an amazing combo. I'm able to protect it, keep it apple clean and stylish, and it folds into a stand, and it unlocks it and locks it when closed and open. I'm Very happy, also I know it doesn't have a retina display but the picture is still very good, I'm comparing this to the my Previous Kindle fire, I know I know this going to be harsh but the kindle feels like a kids tablet but I guess you get what you pay for I got my kindle fire in 2012 mothers day special for 139.99$ that being said it's quite a bit more for the iPad, i'd rather work more and buy the iPad Mini that's how big of a difference I feel there is.A++I have to say I bought my iPad mini 16GB black from an Third Party eBay seller, because amazons price was higher and that's the only shame in this that amazon almost wants you to buy there tablet and keeps the apple jacked up maybe that isn't the case, but how it looks.                    got it for my son and he uses it like 8 hrs a day. its awesome and easy to use.                    Looking for a new Ipad with plenty of storage and found it here.  Was worried about purchasing electronics on the Web but the price was right.  Took a shot and glad I did, the unit was exactly as described, still had a warranty and looks/runs great!                    I have the Kindle Fire which is fantastic! I wanted to try the IPad Mini for work purposes.  I keep my books (and most of my things) on my Kindle and have used the IPad for work, games and searches.  Still prefer the Kindle actually.                    Just what i was looking for.  Beyond expectations. Great product and good quality.  It is very user friendly and easy to use.                    I really love this iPad.  It's compact enough that I can carry it in my purse.  Very easy to set up and navigate.  I bought a leather cover for it that was only about $20.00 and it's thin enough that it doesn't add much to the slim size of the iPad at all.  I also bought a screen saver for it.  That screen save was about $12.00 which, I know, is a bit more than most screen savers, but I strongly recommend it.  It was SO EASY to apply.  NO BUBBLES.
!###I love my iPad mini! It is everything I wanted in a tablet and more. Anyone thinking of buying this, don't hesitate at all!                    Muy buen producto y entrega a tiempo , lo recomiendo , calidad y servicio , very good, excelente . .                    El producto llego como lo acordado en el perfil, caja sellada con todos sus elementos en perfecto estado. Envi&oacute; en el tiempo requerido. Comprado desde Venezuela.                    got this for my wife ( B - day ) present.  when it comes to tablets i could go for any brand really as long as it is functional. Except my wife wanted an ipad and since it arrived before her birthday i was able to surprise her with it.  when it comes to gifts for that special someone you really cant low ball it or substitute.                    This is my 4th iPad (2 1st generation and one second generation). The title of the review says most of it: I am as happy with the mini as the others; and it is a good step up from the 1st generation. The smaller size makes it easier for travel and things like flying. That said, you do need to think about the size of the tablet and how you are going to use the mini. Typing takes some additional getting used to: in portrait it is wider than an iPhone and hard to hold and use thumbs. In landscape it's smaller and harder to &#34;touch-type&#34;.                    Love this iPad mini. Fast processor with strong WiFi antenna. Nice camera. Tons of applications. Going to get it for only $329 @ Best Buy though.                    I was very impressed with the product and glad that it came a day after Christmas. It was unopened and in good condition as well as a great gift. Very pleased with the mini and recommend it to everyone who doesn't have a tablet already.                    Product was like it said,brand new in box..Ordered it Friday before Christmas Eve by noon & it was received Monday,Christmas Eve around 5:00 pm cst as promised. Very pleased with shipping & the item                    The size is much nicer than the full size iPad. It's much easier to hold and much lighter.  Not a slouch on speed either                    I have owned every edition of iPad. Each one has had 64GB storage plus Wi-Fi. Each "old" iPad has been passed down to lawyers in my office where it has been an essential tool in our practice. In our office all of our computers, save one for very specific software reasons, are Macs. One of my associates has even bought his own Apple MacBook Pro MD101LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop (NEWEST VERSION). Our phones are Apple iPhone 4S 64GB (White) - AT&T and my own Apple iPhone 4S 64GB (Black) - AT&TThe effect of all of these iPads and OSX computers has been to take full advantage of iCloud and numerous critical apps such as Square, RocketMatter, Lexis Advantage, WD2Go, Dropbox, TrialPad and Sign My Pad. Our Mac office is essentially a model for Apple products as high end business tools in the legal profession.For the past several months I been constantly asked if I was ever going to acquire an iPad Mini. Until this past week, when I began to reconsider, my answer was emphatic-NO!A smaller iPad was not likely ever to serve as an everyday tool, one that could replace a laptop in many (but not all) situations. I have been critical of WiFi only iPads believing that by maintaining access to the Internet is critical when traveling, in WiFi free courthouses and opponents' law offices. I have also insisted on 64GB iPads believing that storage should never be an issue, particularly as we move into an era where FaceTime promises to reinvent video testimony.So what am I doing buying the lowest end iPad Apple sells? The answer is that not all users are created equal. Our office manager is uniquely involved in all aspects of the practice. She monitors my emails (and I might add she is my wife so this isn't as dangerous as it sounds), reviews accounting issues including billing and time keeping. At times she has simply taken my Apple iPad MD371LL/A (64GB, Wi-Fi + AT&T 4G, White) 3rd Generation when I get home for these uses instead of sitting with her Apple iMac MD093LL/A 21.5-Inch Desktop (NEWEST VERSION) that is our home computer.The reality is she is primarily monitoring the life of our firm, not creating pleadings and doing trial prep. When this occurred to me, I realized that the smallest iPad mini was the best way to provide her with the same 24/7 access to the file server at the office (using WD2Go) that we all enjoy and need. On the other hand, she is unlikely to need a 4G LTE connection since most of her work is done either in the office or at home. That said, as I considered this, her Apple iPhone 4S 32GB (White) - AT&T is a personal hotspot, a capacity which is useful for those moments Internet access is necessary but unavailable on with tablets or laptops. 16GBs is in fact a massive amount of storage for most purposes and users.The iPad mini is light and while offering less "display real estate" is as fully functional as its big brothers. I loaded it from my App Store account with the essential apps for her needs. If you are wondering about cost, the additional cost is zero at least for the number of iOS devices-four-now on my App Store account. For those who would consider buying a cheaper non-iOS tablet, the costs of apps can be significantly more than the price differential between the iPad mini and smaller Droid tablets.While the iPad mini does not offer Retina Display like my new iPad, none of the older iPads my associates use do either. The look, feel and functionality of this tablet is pure iPad.Simply put under the right circumstances the iPad mini is a reasonable and economical choice for a Mac heavy law practice.
!###The Mini is as light and handy as Apple advertised it to be! It can do everything 'big brother' can do! It totally met my expectation. It is fast and sleek, a lean, mean machine, easy to understand. Shipping experience with AJ Wholesale was awesome.                    First of all, this is cheaper at the apple store, even Walmart has it for the same price as the apple store, so if you want this please save yourself some money and buy elsewhere!I don't know where to begin, I guess I should say I am using my iPad Mini to type this review and I find it easy to use to type. I really love this thing, it's slim and light and in have all my apps synced to my iPhone without a problem, which makes me happy, I could not do that on my kindle fire.I love the apple operating system, it's always smooth and just flat out works well.Being said that I have an iPhone(4S) I am a little disappointed the mini doesn't have the crisp retina display, but I'm sure it would be a bit more expensive if it did, and it is already a bit overpriced to begin with. But if you use it to organize your life like I do, the price for a smooth running system is well worth it. I'm sure they will be coming out with the mini retina by march or November 2013, I might upgrade when the 3rd gen. comes out and let my husband or my kid have this oneI LOVE APPLE :-)                    As a first-time iPad owner, I am very pleased. I think it is safe to say that I am officially obsessed with the newest addition to my little Apple family:) Having small hands, this is the perfect sized tablet for me and its sleek design makes transportation a breeze. I also wasn't aware that Siri was on the iPad mini and was ecstatic to finally meet her;) The first thing I noticed when I saw it in person was that it is not as small as depicted online. I was worried about it being too &#34;mini&#34; but it is noticeably bigger than the iPhone 4 (about 4 times bigger) and significantly smaller than the normal iPads.One thing I was slightly disappointed with was the App Store. I found that several of my most-used apps on my iPhone were not available for the iPad. However, I am still glad I treated myself to a little post-Christmas gift and I'm excited to explore my new iPad mini!If it wasn't evident already, I would of course recommend this iPad to anyone, especially to those with smaller hands.                    This product is great me and my wife have one she has the white and I have the black 64GB + wifi+ network the speed is blazing the clarity is crystal clear and we have crappy Internet speed and its fast I could only imagine it on a faster network but if your looking to invest in this product GO BIG because I find myself getting more and more useful apps please treat yourself it'll be worth it you'll forget the price lol                    My husband told me I could have one for Christmas- an iPad 4 or a mini. I chose the 4 in the beginning, because i was sure the mini would be too small. I have played with my husbands kindle fire, and it was just to small. I figured I could have no real use for anything smaller than the original iPad I already had. Then I started researching, and found out that the mini seemed to be a good choice. I went in and compared the two side by side, and was amazed at how much I loved the mini. So I changed my mind and asked for the white 32gb mini instead. I regret nothing! This thing is awesome! It's so thin and light, and just all around beautiful. Much more portable than the larger iPad, but I didn't lose out on the ability to see it, either. It's nowhere near the small, impossible to see mess that is the kindle fire. And the white one makes me think of both high tech future technology, and a white chocolate slab. Both are wonderful :-)                    This is my first iPad product and I love it. It charges quickly and has a nice small charging port. It was easy to set up and get going.                    So after waiting for 2 weeks and thinking should I or shouldn't I, I went ahead and got it. 32 gig black. I am a owner or 1st gig ipad 32 gig. But wanted something more up to date, lighter and smaller. So I went to best buy and got it. I must say I am so happy that I did. I really enjoy this thing.  Before I got my mini I went and got a nexus 7. I returned it after 3 days wasn't completely satisfied, I am glad I did. Apps, build quality and feel of the ipad mini is just so much better. I have to say I haven't been able to put it down since I got it. I have given my 5 year old son my 1st gen ipad and told him to keep his hands off my mini. Lol. So if your stuck with the should I or shouldn't I get the mini, take my advice , you should and you will not regrete it.                    Finally an iPad mini. WOW! Not too big, not too small. Much more functional and portable than the standard 11" screen iPads. Screen is clear and crisp. Movies look great. Very light weight. Beats every other 7" category pad hands down. I ordered both this iPad-Mini and the kindle fire HD, and realized the iPad was far superior. Plus you can load all your previous iTunes purchases, including movies, to the iPad mini. If you use iTunes and have purchases thru iTunes, the kindle WILL NOT allow sharing of any of all those iTunes media files. Only the iPad will. Battery last an amazing long time. Much longer than the old 11" iPad's. Probably because it is smaller and uses less energy? Uses the newer apple plug. Same connector as the iPhone 5. Charges with the same smaller apple usb-cube power wall charger. Comes with the same power cube as the iPhones come with. No special high powered cube, as does the larger 11" iPads require and came with. What a treat to use. I sold my iPad 3 for the same price as this mini costs, so I broke even. Plus, the old iPad 3 included ATT cell service. This iPad was the only wifi version. What to do? Get the ATT hotspot, nearly free and same monthly fee, and use this mini with the hotspot. Plus, hotspot allows multiple wifi devices to tap into the wifi hotspot, where as the built-in cell service on the iPad-3 only supplied cell service to that one device, your iPad -3.Save a lot by getting the iPad-mini wifi version, PLUS a hotspot. Best of all worlds. Much more functionality. Same fees.Don't let only one device hog your cell service, share it with a hotspot to all your iDevices (as well as all your non-apple wifi devices).PS. If you want your iPad mini NOW, this price is not that bad.And it was in stock.And shipping with prime was excellent.Just compare what other non-apple supply sources/stores are asking, like HSN or ShopNBC. Now THAT was highway robbery.Figure in NO TAX, availability, prime shipping, and there you are! IPad-mini in hand without the nightmare of entering the horrifying local Apple Store. EEEEK! TAX! Crowds! Zombies! EEEEK!                    we like ours better than our iPad two....screen resolution isn't as great as the kindle fire HD ( which is beautiful by the way)but this little mini packs a HUGE punch!  Will probably sell or give away the larger ipad two we've had since that one came out...this ones extra screen size over other 7 inch tablets gives it a little edge...but if you are merely looking for a small tablet for movie/tv show viewing you could save $$ by getting a kindle fire HD...screen resolution is so much sharper.....But if you have to have this slice of the apple pie (and you have other apple devices and iTunes etc) This is an Ideal tablet...check out the Zugadget cases here on Amazon..they are Beautiful.....great quality...and much cheaper than what Apple has out!!
!###I had an iPad 2 for work, but I had to return it when I went on maternity leave, so I thought the iPad Mini would be a good substitute. It's great - an excellent size and weight. I don't miss the larger iPad at all! I truly enjoy using it.                    She loves it. Also got her a Logitech keyboard. She loves it. It was the best present that I could give her.                    Like the Mini iPad, a little hard to figure out but has great potential.  Am taking a class at Apple to learn everything                    I use this product exclusively for Foreflight in a Cessna 182.  It is a very convenient size for flying and the battery lasts a long time.                    Just love it. I just bought the mini and I have no complaints I think it is awesome. I recommend it to everyone.                    My first Apple product. I will be using it principally for use in the field for observation of birds. It allows me to carry electronic guide books with a great weight saving, make lists and notes of observations and play songs and calls. It will take a little time to adjust to the Apple interface after PCs, but so far it seems very practical and intuitive. I will also use it for book-reading and I am very pleased to find it so comfortable for reading.I would have liked to know that a couple of apps only work properly after synching to iTunes, but I figured it out eventually!                    Amazing and usefullInteractiveEntertainer, multifunctional and helpfullThis is a great way to keep you closer of the digital worldwide                    it is the product that i have been searching for im really glad for the ipad mini recommended no words to explain how much love my new ipad mini from Apple                    like the ipad because I can play my games without sitting in front of computer I can sit in my favorite chair                    This mini its just as Ipad 2 or 3, great and big screen, and with a great price. I bought it for my mom and she was thrilled. I Recommend it widely.

I want everyone to know that MOST LIKELY you are purchasing a slightly used iPad. It is pretty much practically new (though I only can speak for myself, others may have gotten iPads in worse conditions). I don't see any damages on mine and it works fine. If you want a brand spanking new and NOT PREVIOUSLY OWNED then don't buy from sellers on amazon. The iPad I have was bought roughly three months ago and my guess is the previous owner did not want it and sold it to one of these sellers you see here. I don't think these sellers can guarantee that the iPad is fully functional with nothing wrong with it but that it looks new and wasn't used for very long. I still have 9 months left on the warranty and the technical support is almost up in a few days this month. I don't know how iPads are packaged but it seemed to be packaged nicely though I can tell it was not brand spanking new from the box. The serial number and more stuff on the back looked smudged and the box was slightly bent at the corners. At first I attributed that to the shipping but it wouldn't look like that through shipping alone. I just want everyone to know what they're buying. If you can afford to buy it here then I suggest you go to apple and purchase a new one even with the tax. It's worth it I promise you. If you don't mind buying a previously owned iPad mini that is like new then by all means. I bought from iPadShop btw and it was fulfilled by amazon not that really means anything it just ships from an amazon fulfillment center instead of directly from the seller and I doubt they really check what they're getting but it just gave me peace of mind that if I did end up getting a lousy iPad atleast I felt that amazon would be held accountable for it. :) Anyway good luck shoppers and savers. &lt;3                    The iPad mini is an excellent little tablet. I use it every day and it works flawlessly.Pros:-Battery life is very, very satisfying. 9-10 hours as promised.-Light and compact. I can hold it for long periods without getting fatigued.-It just works. Apps work as advertised. Everything operates smoothly. Some juts or pauses every so often but nothing to get you frustrated (unlike my Galaxy Nexus).-Brightness. The screen can really pump out a bright image in direct sunlight or as a flashlight in the dark.-Premium feel. I almost always keep a case on it, but when I take it off I can really appreciate just how lavish the metallic finish and sturdy build feel in my hands. It really is a premium tablet that you wanna show off, as opposed to the new galaxy tabs that look like giant plastic phones.-Perfect size for media consumption. I read the news and watch videos daily, surf tumblr, Facebook, etc. The size just feels right for all of it.-Fantastic speakers. The bass won't "boom", but sound is clear and VERY loud for the size of the tablet. Easily fill a small room with ambience.Cons:-Screen resolution. It's alright with iOS 6. But I have the iOS 7 beta, which everyone gets in fall. The font is much slimmer and therefore looks VERY pixelated and jagged. They may change it before the official release but I doubt it as it's a huge part of the system overhaul. I'm still waiting for the retina mini.-iPhone-only apps that aren't specifically made for iPad look like crap. They don't show them in retina resolution, but pre-iPhone 4 QVGA blown up. It looks terrible. The only workaround I found is jailbreaking and downloading Retinapad, which forces the apps into retina resolution. They look great after doubling the pixels.-The usual apple limitations. No direct music download, no SD slot, limited customization. Here aren't really downfalls of the mini, just apple's devices as a whole.Overall I love my iPad. Like I said, I have the iOS 7 beta and I know everyone will love this little tab even more when that rolls out. Better notification drawer, intuitive multitasking (no more little X's to repeatedly tap!), quick controls, it's all boss. I highly recommend it. The only thing I'd love more is a retina version, supposedly coming this fall. If you can wait 3 months, I'd hold off for that. Otherwise, dive into the addiction like the rest of us. Viva La iPad!                    I loved my iPad Mini as soon as I got it for XMas and I had to purchase one for my husband. Now we are both avid users of the iPad mini!                    Excelent. I'm completely falling in love with it. Apple fan without excuse. Light, thinner, beautifull. Now i have to enjoy it 100% :)                    Siri has a comeback for everything...and I mean everything, listening to my brother talk to her and her give him attitude back was the highlight of my day!  I am going to order my own Ipad Mini, my bro says its awesome!                    I love my mini iPad.  Cost was more at amazon than I saw at a couple other places, but ordering was easy and came promptly, packaged well.  I love the size and functionality of the mini iPad.  I did trade a kindle for the iPad because I wanted the camera, front and rear facing camera.  I also wanted ability to do FaceTime.  I'm extremely happy with my purchase and would recommend it over any other.                    Excelente :) muy buen producto lo recomiendo &#128570; excelente transasccion ,rapida,  Y SEGURA &#128515; LLEGO ANTED DE LO ACORDADO :)                    01/09/13I love the Ipad mini so far. I purchased the Belkin @TV to stream live TV or recorded shows from mmy DVR in NJ to my tablet in MD. It works pefect. The processor of the Ipad mini and the wireless capabilities can handle streaming live video over 2 seperate wifi connections perfectly. Hotel wifi isn't generaly the strongest either. The selection of apps are great of the Ipad. The interface is very responsive as well. I purchased the Khomo keyboard case for the mini, and I am able to type with a physical keyboard and interface with the Ipad min without a problem. It has worked flawlessly for me thus far. I am able to check email and surf the web with ease. The screen is the perfect size and the tablet is lightweight an portable to use anywhere. I highly recommend this product.Feel free to ask any questions.01/07/13I purchased the Ipad Mini for $352.03 @ Apple with Tax and Free Shipping. The inner components of the Ipad Mini are comparable to that of the Ipad 2, A5 processor, 512MB RAM. I purchased this because the traditional Ipads are too bulky, large, and heavy. This one weighs ounces even in a case and works perfect. The screen is large enough to surf the web, write texts and emails, type in word processor, etc. There is an app called CloudOn that allowed me to access my files remotely and edit them with a word software. The Ipad Mini maintains the full functionality of any other Ipad and can download an run any application the Ipad runs. It is convenient that it has the same application base built with reliable apps.The machine runs smooth. It hasn't really glitched or froze on me in the month I have had it so far. It runs video very smoothly, and is very responsive. It connects to the internet with no problems over a wi-fi connection. I will test out the processor by seeing how well it works with the Belkin @TV. It streams video from my home wi-fi remotely to wherever I am. Once I do that, I will further update my review.
!###I have really liked the Ipad Mini. It is a great product and well worth the money. Some of the things I have really liked are: It has lock and unlock features; It is very user friendly; It's also small, and very portable. I really love how easy it is to use internet, and access my email, and how you can text on it. The camera takes fairly good quality pictures. They are not as good as an actual camera could take, but the pictures are not blurry or grainy. Something that has really come in handy is the notes app. It is really nice to be able to make lists on it, or write down reminders. It is sensitive to touch, and there is lots of storage space.The battery life is great, lasting up to 3 or more hours. Other things you might be interested in are,CalendarThousands of free appsHas a simple set upCan search your apps I prefer the Ipad Mini to the Ipad, because the Ipad Mini is smaller and easier to use. The Ipad mini is black, with the apple sign on the back. The home screen either has your apps in rows or groups of apps. You get to choose your background. My only complaints about this product, are that the screen is easy to break; and that it takes a long time to charge. Because it takes so long to charge, I try not to use it as much.When i use my Ipad mini, is when I need to go somewhere and do some work on it, at home, or just to pass the time.                    This is the perfect tablet for our toddler. We are able to download learning APPs for her and its SO easy to use. Love the front facing camera option. Works like a gem.                    I purchased this for my 8 year old Grandson's birthday.  It came exactly as expected.  His words were &#34; I have the best Grandma ever!&#34;  And &#34; I am s-o-o-o lucky!  My son has said that the IPad is doing great and he is still so thrilled about it.  Thanks !                    Very easy to buy and was very fast to get in my house.Simple to use and amazing features ... I love it!!!                    she use it for everything for school for work for setting up my business my daughter loves it its very helpful                    my mom said that's the best birthday gift ever!I'm also very happy--now she will not use my iphone for candy crush!                    We bought this as a surprise for my daughter's birthday. The order was filled quickly and we are completely satisfied with the product!                    Always uses my computer often for many things.  Have found it so much easier to use I-Pad and carry it with me.                    Amazing! I was scared to order this type of product from an online source,  but I was  Not disappointed.  It was in perfect condition and I was incredibly pleased!                    It more that I expect.  Its a great help for my ebooks and for work out of the office or play in travels.
!###I originally started considering a larger reading tablet since I've been doing all my reading on my iphone kindle app.  I wanted a larger screen, but something easily portable.  I also get most of my recipes online/pinterest and off the internet so I wanted something small that I could transport easily through the house to the kitchen, rather than lugging my laptop from room  to room.  I did some homework by reading reviews on the biggest selling mini tablets:  Kindle Fire HD, Nexxus 7 inch tablet, Ipad Mini, and the Nook.  It came down to two...the Kindle Fire and Ipad Mini.  Since the Fire got great reviews by almost everyone, and was 130. cheaper for apparently better visuals and sound, I ordered the Fire so that I could have it in time for our holiday travels.  I loved the Fire's display and sound, but as I was watching an Amazon video, I noticed how heavy and thick it was, and was annoyed by the fact that it had almost a one inch margin around the edges of the screen (reducing the screen display area).  I read that was because of the speaker hardware inside the tablet.  The Android system also annoyed me.  It's just not as straight forward as the i0S system. I decided to go to Best Buy to get a hands on view of each device (so should have done that to begin with)  I immediately fell in love with the Mini Ipad's looks and feel and visuals looked great to me.  I figured the sound would be ok since it was an Apple Product and I didn't want a sound machine anyway.  I regretted buying the Fire and decided to return it and order the Ipad.  I have absolutely no regrets.  I can have the Kindle App and access to Amazon, I can get the Amazon streaming videos with Prime (not a big deal since their video selection is lame) And all of the Apple apps I have grown used to with my iphone.  What I like best:-The Mini is much lighter and delightfully thin.  I can hold it forever without noticing the weight.-Unless I did a side by side comparison on display and sound, I notice no real difference.-7.9 size is perfect.  The Fire is smaller and narrower in comparison and when I read I want as much width as I can get without being bulky.  Also, the screen goes out almost to the edges of the tablet with slightly larger margins on top and bottom, which just makes more sense and makes a big difference in how much display you get to see at one time without having to enlarge.-More straight forward and user friendly in my opinion than Android system.-Sound is just right for most things.  Not a sound machine, but still sounds great and will play a tune without tinny sound and videos are loud enough for anyone except maybe those with significant hearing loss.  My son made a comment on the fact that the sound is surprisingly good for a small tablet.  I read that the sound is an improvement over older Ipads anyway...stereo sound.-Extemely portable.-Since I got it, I haven't used my laptop and probably won't unless I need to do alot of internet surfing or typing.-The Fire in comparison is thick, bulky, heavy with smaller screen size.-I just love it.  If I'm going to spend more money on a small tablet I want to be completely happy with the product and I am.  It's worth the extra 130.00.  I don't know why Amazon sells it for over 400. I got it through Apple at 329.00.-The size is perfect and just what I wanted in a mini tablet.  Not too narrow.What I don't like or wish was better:-It wouldn't hurt to be comparable to the Fire in sound quality or display but really I don't care at this point. Its good. If a better version comes out next year I think I'll still be content with this item.-Its so thin and smooth you will want a case to keep it from slipping off of things.*Also the battery life is impressive.  Reviews speculated approx 10 hours of usage.  On my first charge I got over 15 hours of usage (which included a lot of internet surfing and video watching) and on my second charge I already have over 5 hours of usage and 62% battery charge left.  This will help me conserve battery charge on my iphone.  Oh! What i joy it is to read on this rather than on my iphone what took me so long!                    I purchased my mini as soon as it was available from Apple and my wife took over our 2nd gen iPad with cell. I Chose the wifi only model figuring I would tether to my iPhone when I wanted to use the web away from a wifi connection.As soon as I turned on the mini I was sold.1. Much easier to hold. A good portable device between the small iPhone 5 and the full size iPad.2. The display is better than the 2nd gen iPad thanks to the smaller screen, yet easy to read and good detail for apps ment for the iPads. Note that there is a magnifying capability for iPhone apps that gives a small display full screen display.3. Typing is easy as the keys are spaced apart and large enought for touch typing.4. Believe it or not the mini fits easly into to the side pocket of my vest when housed in a Roocase filo cover. Try to do that with the larger tablets.I spent several hours at Apple's AppStore building a library of iPad apps, most which we're free.  I also purchased apps for using Excel, Word, PDFs and found these worked very well when converting files I placed in iCloud. Reading the converted documents is easy as the print on the mini is large and clear enough not to cause eye strain.A couple of disappointments:1. Teathering to the iPhone 5 is simple, but I found that I use the mini more and more now for web search, texting , etc. and the iPhone 5 primarily for phone calls. A result is i now know that I should have purchased the mini with the cell option. Not a fault of the mini.2. Without the cell networking option, apps that use your location do not work, even when connected to wifi or teathered to the iPhone. This was a disappointment as mini will make a great GPS screen when driving. It also means that apps  that "find" your device won' t work either - I should have thought of this.3. Third party accessories are slow coming to the market. If the accessory uses the lighting connector it probably won't be seen until early 2013. I have also found that cases with keypads are slow coming on the market. The top brand protective cases such as Zagg and Clamcase have yet to release their promised cases.Would like to see: A mini with cell phone connectivity, i. e. a smart phone option. Why some of the smart phone manufacturers have not offered this would be an interesting article.Recomendation: My Windows PC has not been started since the mini arrived. After a month of using the mini without the cell network option, I have ordered one with cell networking. When I get it will probably write a review and if the cell networking works like the larger iPad it will get five stars.Sandbox 2                    The reasons I used to choose the iPad mini. I put my specific needs above buying the biggest and the brightest. The following are what I thought was important for me, it may not be for you.As much as I wanted the retina display, the larger sized iPad was simply too big for me to regularly take outside the house - I made that mistake with buying a too big, too heavy laptop once. But the mini, at 7inches, is big enough to watch movies, read books and magazines on my couch and bed with ease. Those who think a smartphone or ipod does the same thing, are mistaken, even at 7inch, a tablet makes the world of difference - I typed this review on my iPad, I would still be typing if I had used my phone.  If you have never experienced the quality of the retina display, you probably will not miss it here. The thing is solidly build as you would expect from an apple product; the speakers do pack a punch, you can literally feel the air coming out.As for choosing apple over android or windows 8. The need for the use of flash (a deal-breaker for me when the first iPad came out) has lessened substantially, as HTML 5 is now the go to standard for web pages.  Even though I'm a PC user,  I am familiar with apps via my iPod touch. The amount and more importantly, the quality of apps in the apple eco system are far superior to the ones on android. although the novelty has somewhat worn off on the appeal of my impulse buying of apps, it's still a major reason for buying a tablet. Take for example - my optimum cable iOS app, it is so far superior to its android cousin, it's hard to believe that it was written for the same product. Based on my experiences with dubious apps in the (for better or worse) largely unsupervised google play store, via my Samsung Galaxy, there is an advantage to being part of the paternal Apple market. Although, I expect this to change dramatically, the next couple of years, Windows isn't even on the same planet, in terms of app selection.  If you need to multitask, are price conscious, or simply despise Apple, the Android based kindle fire HD or nexus, with their better screen quality, may be for you.I bought the 16 gig version, using the extra $$ to buy 4G capability instead, to take advantage of the growing options of cloud computing when I travel. If you have kids and travel a lot with and without them, or for business, you should seriously consider the 4G option, as ubiquitous, free, reliable Wifi, like flying cars, has yet to be a reality. If you get the wifi only version, don't have an iPod, but still can't live without your stored media, you probably should consider 32 gigs minimum, especially if you don't get the 4G. The other issue of Verizon CDMA vs AT&T's GSM network, is a whole other story. One slight peeve. The "lighting fast" connector looks nicer than the older one but it's clearly a money making device (apple could have finally accepted the virtually USB standard but why give your loyal customers the option of using a ubiquitous $10.00 cable, when you can charge triple times that, if you need a replacement) Mine still does not charge my iPad, when connected to my "older" (30 month old computer,) I  have to do so from a wall outlet.Long story short, I've had mine for a few days, with no regrets. Yes, the retina display will be tempting but is not worth waiting months for on the mini. Life is short. You can always trade up next year.                    I have to say after having the iPad and iPad 2, I was hesitant to move up to the 3rd gen iPad, especially since I was happy with my iPad 2. I had heard about the iPad mini and decided to go to a store to look at one. After picking it up for the first time, I was sold. It is incredibly light! It just felt so much less bulky than any other iPad I'd had and bonus for the first time ever I can just slip it in my purse instead of having to have a bigger messenger bag on days when I wanted to take my iPad out with me.As for versus the high resolution displays, to be honest I have an anti-glare screen protector on all of my iPad so at the end of the day it makes no difference. I can watch a movie or read a book or send and email quite comfortably. To me this is what I never knew I always wanted in my iPad, and I do just love it.As for the price, I do think it should have been price 10% lower to give it the solid under $300 mark on the 16GB. For me though I like iOS, I've tried android and it just wasn't for me. Android devices in many cases are also quality but at the end of the day I always say try both and figure out what you like best. For me, it's iOS, it's simple and direct so for my first 7&#34; tablet I decide to splurge and it was work it.                    I like this particularly as a new elderly  user.  The larger ones were not easy to carry around in my purse.                    The video display, especially for small texts is fuzzy. You assume that the newest apple device will have sharp texts even if it doesn't have retina display. After using my iPhone 5 and iPad 4 for a few month now, my eyes can not with the fuzziness of the text. It has the equivalence of an $150 tablet in regards to the the sharpness of texts. I bought it and returned it in the se day. So check out a website or book with small tests before buying. Some say its not that bad, but for 350$ I expected more.                    I ordered this &#34;new&#34; product. When it arrived it was in an already opened box, it was not &#34;new.&#34; When I contacted the seller I was informed that the product hadn't been used that the box was only opened to ensure that everything was accounted for. Be warned that if you are expected a new sealed in factory packing product, this is not it.                    Couldn't be more pleased with this purchase! I am a student and having a tablet that I can carry to class in my bookbag vs carrying a laptop around with me is so much more convenient when I already have so many other books and binders with me.  I bought the mini vs the regal sized ipad because of the thinness and the lightweight.  I usually have pretty bad buyers remorse, but not with this item.  Its so easy to hold in one hand and operate.  Would highly recommend for any student or teacher, or anyone on the go.                    Android just doesn't compare. I don't think an iPad needs my review to sell it, we have 2 plus an Android, guess which ones we actually use?
!###Love this, came quickly, holds a long charge and syncs with all my other Apple products.  I love that it fits in my everyday purses for easy carry and use not he go.                    I already knew I liked the I pad mini, I just ordered one for my daughter for Christmas thinking it might take a few weeks to come in. It came in 2 day!! Very impressed with this company I bought it from and I won't hesitate to order from them again. I opened the box, which was sealed and everything is brand new contrary to what some others have stated on here. Very happy                    I primarily use the iPad Mini for business purposes and I must say that this is the best tablet I have used for just about anything.Without a doubt, iOS 7 is annoying on the Mini or any other iPad but I still find it to be a more useful tablet than the ones running on Android.If you are already an Apple fan then the iPad Mini is a no-brainer if you can deal with a less-than-amazing screen. If you prefer smaller tablets, the Mini is the way to go but if you really need a high-res screen, Apple has just come out with the iPad Mini with Retina, so buy that if you need to.- Seth Fitzgerald, Journalisthttp://inquisitr.com/author/seth-fitzgerald@SethAFitzgerald                    I bought this device for my wife for school. The device is sleek so for the safety place purchased and otterbox my wife love it.                    GOOD:It is very good to use by every body even by the small child. It never hang up. It always refresh.                    IS A SPECTACULAR TABLE I CAN TELL WITH EYES CLOSED. I INVITE YOU TO BUY THIS CHART MINI. SPECTACULAR EXCELLENT AND VERY GOOD                    We love our new ipad! It's used on a daily basis and take it almost everywhere with us. Perfect size for traveling. I would recommend any apple product.                    Device arrived as described and in a very quick fashion.  Would recommend for anyone looking for a tablet without needed to rely on wifi hotspots.                    I like the mobility of this sized tablet.  I enjoy Amazon customer service and think it's what customer service should be!!!  I rate it very good if not the best, by phone or over the web, in all aspects I've experienced.                    The iPad works as i expected. There is only one problem: the screen is a little squishy in the upper left corner. You can feel the glass press down and it is a little worriesome. Otherwise im pretty happy with it
!###Good value for the money I spent. It was a present for someone else but I played with it a little bit.                    The only problem i have right now is getting ruby blast to work on it; although that is a game design problem.                    Great product.this was truly a great buy it works great for my girl going back to school. I am impressed.                    Works great as expected. iOS 7 loaded and processor can handle that version as well.The smaller form factor is nice.Recommended.                    5th one i bought this year for my family. Love it. Can't complain. plus its an apple product in my opinion no apple product has fail me yet.                    Very good unfortunately a little small for the person I bought it for, but I will keep it myself.I am still learning how to use it.                    I highly recommend this product. A sharp display coupled with a compact and portable design make the iPad Mini a very useful device.                    This is a great apple product, I love it!  Small enough to keep at your fingertips and light enough to carry with you.                    Great Price and shipped quick. I purchased the 32 GB because I didnt know if I was going to use it to save pictures and data                    No worry about preowned. Sealed tight.Surprised to discover I could talk to this tablet and get answers.Extremely pleased!
!###There is no incentive or need to buy this product. I have used once of these Ipad mini's several times and it is just another Ipad only smaller...whats next the revolutionary Ipad 6" Nano or the Ipad mini with retina display for 600 dollars? ROFL. If you have an Ipad already or have ever purchased an Ipad previously you already own a 10" version of the Ipad mini, there is nothing new or revolutionary about this device. For what this device is it's way over priced both on amazon and apple websites/store if they are trying to compete. Most other 7" tablets are selling for 100-250$ and for the most part they offer alot more functionality and bang for your buck than IOS or any Ipad let alone this mini one. This is just an effortless, pointless cash grab device. Not impressed with this or the Iphone 5 as again it's a pointless buy as a new one will be on the way within a year which will be the same phone recycled with more rounded corners. Maybe now that Jobs is gone so are Apple's "revolutionary" idea's *cough* magical marketing prowess.                    I cancelled this order two days after ordering because my son gave me one as a gift.  Worldwide Distributors told me it was too late to cancel, it was already being shipped.  It took me two weeks to get it.  Just as I received the package, Worldwide Distributors sent me an email asking me to check the serial number because they had received some defective products.  Their return instructions indicated to return the package unopened so I was unable to comply with their request and responded to their email reminding them I was returning this product.  They also require the package cannot be returned in the box received.  So it cost me $25 to put the package in another box and mail.  They received it on a Monday and said 5-7 business days to receive a refund.  I called 10 business days later and, fortunately, got a hold of someone named Fernando.  He was great and processed my refund the same day.  Amazon then took another 3 business days to apply the refund.  It is amazing how they can instantaneously take your money and it takes many days to refund it.  I would never purchase anything from this Worldwide Distributors again.  Who knows, if I had kept it, it may have been defective, then where would I have been?!                    Yes, I bought it and it works exactly to the advantage of Apple company not me. Everything is limited and designed with company making money from me, customer. The unit does have choice between Wifi and 4G in theory--sure, but try to use it and suddenly you have to pay for Wifi access, hm. Ok.As in all Apple tablets the screen dont give you what regular laptop does but limit you to about half of all info. As with all tablets you dont have unlimited data and even lousy 5 gigs cost a fortune. Everything stricly limited to Apple and if you wanna download your own movie to memory--goodluck.A toy for grown ups.                    The iPad does not work. I will need to get a new one.. Child wad dissapointed. Need to exchange. Help                    This thing looks like one of those Chinese imitations you buy on the side walks for like $20.1024x768 on a 8 inch screen. LOL hahahhaha. Might aswell go back to the days of black and white CRT TV from the 60's while we at this level.A Google Nexus 7 costs $229 on Amazon and has 1280x720 HD IPS on a 7 inch which brings the ppi up to 216 which is the level of the Samsung Galaxy S2 i9100.Who would be dumb enough to buy this outdated garbage for such high price and keep it? I don't know. Sending this garbage back asap!!                    I was waiting for something else... Maybe if I had received the correct one I would be happier. Normally I am really happy with Apple items and that's why I have iPhone iPod etc but seller sent the wrong one and now amazon blocked my account!! Thank you very much!!!
!###Device performed very slow.  Switching for app to app took several seconds.  Battery life was abysmal and the screen hurt my eyes with its poor resolution.  I bought a galaxy tablet instead and am completely satisfied.                    I bought this product April 2013 for my husbands birthday. He has not had any problems at all with this product. The battery last a long time. It is light weight and easy to use. It arrived very quickly. I love Amazon !!                    I always used Android tablets for both work and personal, but just switched to the IPad mini . This was one of the best choice of my life. It was one of the most easiest tablets to learn by far and has everything I needed for both work and personal. I would recommend this to everyone for everything from personal, school and work.                    this mini i pad is just what i needed for the christmas holiday for my grandson. also the price was just right.                    Love it!  Easy to work with and will not buy anything else after trying a Surface tablet too.  Just ordered another one for my husband.                    Purchased this for my 9 year old for his bday.  We went through 3 android tablets (cheap ones) and I decided to purchase this one and he loves it and I am loving it as well. I am more of android person and now thinking about Ipad Air.                    This product was for a work partner. He is very pleased with the ipad. This is just what he wants!... A beautiful piece of technology                    I found the product I needed at a good price and was very satisfied with it. The shipping was fast. Highly recommended, thank you.                    Love this product. Especially at this price point. an amazing piece of hardware that can really change the way i do my work.
!###I bought this primarily to play music videos and had to return it. I have many music videos in my iTunes, but when I synched them to this ipad I discovered that they can only be found by title and only in a thumbnail format (no list format available). I need a tablet with an os that will allow me to find my music videos by artist and then title. This tablet may do many things very well, but it is a miserable failure for any user who has even a minor interest in using it to play music videos.                    Are you thinking about buying a tablet? There are so many tablets to pick from. There are tablets by Apple, Microsoft, Samsung, Nexus, Windows, etc. There are so many different choices, so many different brands. Every single tablet is different. But what tablet is better? How do you know which one to buy? Some like Window products other like Apple products more. Each and every single person is different but there is one iPad that fits all. I believe the iPad Mini is probably the best choice of all, it perfect for everyone. Why should you buy the Apple iPad mini? Well Apple is a very well known company all across the globe. They have created some of the best computers, laptops, created the iPod and the iPhone. Who does not love Apple products? They have the best and most advanced technology. Apple does not let you down, it meets all the expectations, and you will be surprised with what you can do with their products. Mostly everyone has an Apple product these days; personally in my family we own eight Apple products, in which the iPad mini is one. We are very happy with all our Apple products from our laptop and PC to our iPods and iPad. We can say that Apple has not let us down with any of their products we have bought and I know probably many out there agree with us. Why is the iPad mini perfect? First of all the iPad mini is the perfect size, it is not bulky at all. It is only 5.28 inches by 7.87 inches and it is 0.28 inches thick. It can easily be carried in your purse or in you backpack and it won't weigh anything at all. It is also perfect for all college students out there, you can easily take notes with the iPad mini and will never have to worry about forgetting or buying a notebook, so the iPad mini helps you save trees. The iPad mini is also perfect for your children; you can download games, TV shows, or movies. Its perfect for them to use any day, and very perfect for when going on a road trip you can play a movie, give them headphones and make it a peaceful ride where your child wont be bored and start bothering you. The iPad mini is perfect for anyone out there, no matter what it needs to be used for. The iPad mini also has a great camera, which takes very nice pictures. And iPad minis are also starting to be used in schools, which as you can see iPad minis are starting to be used mostly everywhere, why not have one of your own. The iPad mini will make you happier. You can download movies, books, its also can have Wi-Fi. Having an iPad mini will make you very happy, you don't have to carry around bulky books anymore, and you can easily download more then one book on your mini iPad. The iPad mini changes your life, it makes you more modern, and you become more technological. The whole world is becoming more technological, might as well buy an iPad mini and keep up. In conclusion, I believe the iPad mini is the best choice of table. Its produced by a very well known company all around the world. It has the latest technology and it fits all your needs and your families. The iPad mini is very family oriented its perfect for your toddlers to your college students. It perfect for everyday use, for school, and for work. Everyone should have an iPad mini its perfect                    I had a poor experience with the initial start up.  When I called the number on the one sheet &#34; user guide &#34;the &#34;support&#34; person was no help,  made me wait for someone who was to know something.  His main interest was in selling me a $165.00 support package.  I didn't buy!!  All I wanted was someone to help me past the opening screen.  I have family help that achieved that.  I love the actual iPad though.  The key board is small for my fat fingers but that is no fault of the iPad.                    Everything works as advertised, but there is one thing that is hidden in the information...You cannot send Pictures or Videos thru the Lightning Plug Cable to 30 pin Adapter using a 30 pin connector cable to RCA Analog into your RCA inputs on your TV. Only Audio will come thru ok, but not Video or Slideshow.The only option Apple has given us, is buy an AV Cable from Lightning to AV or HDMI. the AV unit is for PC or TVs with PC input.What a shame...Will Apple change this???...Jer                    If you're seriously contemplating buying one, let me help you out......DO IT!!!!!! For weeks I kept questioning myself &#34;is it worth it??&#34; I finally gave in and bought one, I just could not resist !! Hahaha :) I love, love, love it! It truly is a great product and easy to figure out ( at least for me it was ).1 complain I do have though, is about the camera. I expected a flash to be on the iPad mini. Also, it doesn't have the clearest picture quality in general. Of course it's not bad quality, just not clear like I had expected.Besides that, it's great, convenient, fast, has fantastic sound, beautiful crystal clear screen and really, really, really fun!!!!!! Defiantly worth the money !!  TRUST ME :}                    Despues de recibir este producto entre en otra era de la inform&aacute;tica, es un giro de 180 grados en tecnologia                    excellent !!!! ................. ............... ...... ............ . . ........... . . . . . . . . . . .                    POSEO UN IPAD QUE USO PARA REALIZAR PRESENTACIONES, A PENAS SUPE Q SE LANZO ESTA VERSION MINI NO DUDE EN COMPRARLO Y ESTOY 100% SATISFECHO CON LA COMPRA, MUY PRACTICA Y COMODA, EN CUANTO AL VENDEDOR MUY RESPONSABLE, ENVIO RAPIDO, GRACIAS                    La atencion y el envio fueron muy rapido de parte del vendedor, Pues el Ipad mini cuando me llego a mis manos estaba genial como deberia de ser, y sin mucho que agregar sabemos que las cosas apple vienen muy bien hecha es una tablet con comodidad y potencia de las grandes, se las recomiendo 100%%                    I do not think the mini replaces the ipad or the macbook but it does have an important place.First and foremost, it is the crowning glory of all apple products as far as an ebook reader. It reads like a trade paperback in its vertical position. I have read plenty of ebooks on my ipad using ibooks but this puts the ipad inthe shade ebook wise.Second, I have always carried my ipad with me in my purse no matter where I am going. I have now changed this to my ipad mini going along in my purse instead. This gives me access to everything at a perfect, portable size.  I do not need to wear reading glasses to use it.  I find the iphone too small to solely carry that around. Although I prefer going online with my ipad, the mini is perfect for this in carrying around mode.Likewise, I play scrabble, gin rummy and do crosswords on he mini now.  I used to solely use the ipad for this. The reduction in size causes no problems and I can again skip glasses. I am almost 65 so this is a factor for anyone in my age group.I also use the mini now for all of my podcasts.  I love NPR, the New Yorker, the NYTimes, etc., podcasts and mini is perfect for all of those.  It is ideal for both audio and visual podcasts. While I still prefer watching films on my ipad due to the larger screen size, the ipad mini is fine for videos where detail is not as important.I am also now loading different apps onto my mini from what I load onto my ipad. Musical audio visual apps such as Jack White's and Brian Eno's just went onto it as well as several art based apps. Increasingly I am devoting my ipads to films and tv.  I no longer own tv sets, finding the apple products all I need for full audio visual.I use keynote and pages of all of these systems.  Probably the ipad is still my favorite size with those programs but the mini performs very well with them.On a daily basis I am still discovering more and more with the mini.  I am sure I have many discoveries yet to make. But even with only this much discovered, I already love it and highly recommend it.I bought mine online at the apple store.  I got it cheaper than this so you may want to check it out there as well as here. I also got two lines of free engraving etched onto the mini's back, my name and email address,  although you can put whatever you want on yours,
!###This Apple ipad mini had given my daughter lots of amusing Apps to work with. The product is great and has little to no flaws in the program. The company that does the shipping was great to work with and I would recommend them to everyone. Will be glad to do more business any time.                    Absolutely love my iPad. The mini is a perfect size and can easily fit in a large purse for bringing to work or when traveling. One of my favorite Apple purchases                    Loading we pages, especially YouTube, is painfully slow sinc the new IOS7. If it hadn't been, so incredibly quick, before the update, I wouldn't  have known the difference.Mine, also has the quirk, of sometimes randomly deleting all notes, on my notepad.  Annoying, so I have learned, to email notes, to myself, to save them.Other, than those two things, it's like having an iPhone, that's twice as large. I love it and will get a new one, in two years.                    Great little device and delivery service was excellent.  Could have waited for the new ipad, but this little machine is great. I like Apple                    As described. I got it 50 usd cheap and still got the ipad winch was almost new. Actually no one could even tell it was not new as the packing and everything was as good as new one                    Brought this item as a gift for my mother on her birthday and she absolutely loves it.  It arrived very early which was a plus!                    I bought this mini iPad remanufactured and it looks brand-new. I don't have any complaints at all so far and have had about three weeks. The battery life impresses me and seems like leaving it turned on, it can last for two days or so before it even gets close to 50%.I like the speed, the way videos look when watching Netflix or Amazon prime, etc. it has not crashed or froze up on me so far.I would definitely recommend buying a case for it, without a doubt. I bought a $20 case and it isn't bad, it just has a hard time staying open and keeping the iPad propped up when watching a movie. So spend a little bit more and get one that definitely keeps it in a position for when you watch movies.                    We own several Apple products, iPhones, iPads to Macmini.  The iPad Mini is more convenient to carry than the iPad and with a much bigger screen than the iPhone.                    The IPad mini arrived in perfect condition sooner than expected!  It looks brand new, fresh out if the box!  A perfect experience!                    We were blown away by this tablet.  It is small yet does so much!!  We use it with an App that allows us to get charts, weather and traffic when we fly our own airplane.  It was compact enough to mount along side our other instruments.  The Apps available are endless and amazing!!  This was a great purchase.
!###Just perfect. I bought the mini to carry at work and handle some paperwork that is a part of my routine. It exceeds my expectations every time. It just works. Plain and simple. No fighting multiple apps to get an attachment to send, everything is seamless and easy. I can create PowerPoint docs, word, excel, and mark up PDFs. I have little need for our computers at work now because this does it all! Highly recommended.                    Great value for the money and received it quickly. Could not ask for a better price or faster service. ya                    This was a present for my wife, and so far she has used it for e-mail and Internet access. Soon, she will also use it for reading books, magazines, and other applications as well. Although she is not real technically adept, this has been very easy for her to pick up and begin to use immediately with only very rudimentary training.  Excellent purchase.                    A gift that bought myself and it has been a wonderful note pad for me. Still learning about its options and what more it has to offer me, this arrive on time and mint condition as advertise .  .  . Thank you from the bottom of my heart.                    This is a nicely designed light, thin, and portable tablet device. I returned mine after a few days of use as there are too many limitations with tablets (especially of this expense) and I'd rather have a laptop or just use my smartphone. Things I enjoyed about the iPad mini: perfect size in my opinion, easy to set up and use, wide availability of apps and accessories, Amazon app available, nice email interface, bluetooth capable, clear high quality display. The things I didn't like about this device:1. Moving files from a computer to the iPad mini has to be done via iTunes, you can't just copy over a folder of music or videos which is do-able just not as easy as on Android based devices2. Price is quite a bit more than other 7" tablets, but the screen is actually 8" and for an Apple product, I'd say a pretty good value3. Keyboard has no tracing or 'swype' like abilities which makes typing cumbersome without a keyboard.4. App store makes you give a password for every single app you download (even the free ones)5. As an e-reader, I'd chose one of the paper-white options over this, but it works fine for reading.6. Its not a laptopThe last reason is my primary justification for returning the device. For a tablet it does what it is suppose to do. But I found myself still preferring to use my small laptop as multitasking is so much easier. I'd say if you really like using apps or playing games or simple web browsing, a tablet is the way to go. I personally found that for me the full computing power of a laptop is worth the extra weight/size, especially given the cost of this device (i.e., you can buy a small laptop for the cost of the iPad mini). However, if you like tablets, you will find this one a good option. And since Amazon app is available now you can save money over the over-priced content of the iTunes store where the same music/videos cost about 20-30% more.                    Okay, first and foremost I'd like to say that I'm not trying to start a flame war here just simply trying to understand why/how the &#34;consumer&#34; would let apple get away with this, and to try to give the Amazon customer the information they rightfully deserve. To be clear I am writing this review on a fourth generation iPad, so I'm not a hater, but I do think Apples prices aren't justified with their hardware.  I am an AT&T rep who has ample time to use the mini and formulate an opinion about it.  Simply put the screen is garbage.  &#34;Every inch an iPad,&#34; is Apples tag line for the device and I must say, no, it's not.  The iPad I'm using has a truly beautiful screen, that only until recently has been able to compete with.  The mini does not.  Now this is what's true about Apple.  They do not care about the end user.  They don't.  Or else ere would be A RETINA DISPLAY ON THE IPAD MINI.  If they can put it Retina on their phone and their full size iPad then seriously. The second generation will have it for sure, by why make their very loyal and sometimes crazy customer base go through with this?  I guess it's because they can.  I would never buy an iPad mini in its current state, and if you have any buying sense you'd wait to.  It's a waste, and will make you feel real bad you purchased one very, very, soon.  Don't succumb.
!###This IPAD MINI  is same as normal one, it can do everything that a big one can do. it is fast, powerful, easy. I love it..                    I love my iPad Mini - it is exactly what I anticipated.  The retailer who I purchased it from was also top quality.  It shipped right on time and I received it within a matter of days.  I couldn't be happier with both the product and the retailer.                    This review is for the ipad mini 16GB Wi-Fi in blackI bought this ipad mini for a birthday present for my wife, she has one of the original nooks for reading digital books and an ipod G4 and she wanted a device that would eliminate having to use the nook and ipod, the ipad mini is the perfect solution for this! I was torn between getting the mini or the regular size ipad, I chose the mini because its about the same size as her nook, the ipad mini is thinner than the nook which we have now given to our 12 year old daughter for books she is required to read for school, we'll be giving the ipod to a less fortunate family that cannot afford one as my daughter has her own ipod.The Apple app for reading digital books (called ibooks) is actually better than the nook because books can be read in different orientations. ibooks supports PDF format and epub, epub displays the best as it has options to change the font size etc. Any books that come in PDF can be converted to epub (or other formats) for free on numerous converters found online.Game apps load much faster on the ipad and are much more enjoyable to play than on the ipodThe wireless is much better on the ipad than on the ipod as the ipod kept disconnecting and reconnecting from the Internet on our home network, the ipad mini doesn't have this problem.Surfing the Internet is a breeze as well, my wife never used her ipod to surf the Internet, now that she has the ipad mini she surfs the web frequently.It takes great pictures and video which are then uploaded to FB.We'll be taking the ipad mini with us on a cruise and we'll see how it performs once connected to the wireless network on the ship, we'll be using it to check email etc, I'll be updating this review in regard to performance after the cruise.I have never used the standard size ipad so I cannot compare the mini to the standard ipad.                                  This seller is trusted and highly recommended!!! The product is amazing and the best handy iPad so far!!! Two thumbs up!!!                    I love my iPad Mini because it is so much fun and sleek. I would recommend this product to everyone.                    I like this mini iPad,it's great having a large screen Comming from a tiny iPhone screen. I tried the iPad,but it was just too big for me,but the iPad mini is just right.I am Disappointed that Siri won't read whatever I highlight on a web page like my iPhone 4S since my lack of vision keeps me from reading as much as I'd like.The sound quality is just as amazing as the phone,and the keyboard is like a computer keyboard layout rather than the iPhone's keyboard,so for me it takes some getting used to since I'm not familiar with a desktop keyboard.                    Had I pad, gave to wife love the mini, advantage of portability, space and weight reduction versus I-pad.  Strongly recommend!                    I love it!  Perfect size.It is a great product and it was easy to get it started.  Thank you!                    Great product.. but FIX THE RESIZING ON BG PHOTOS!!! The mini is small enough to be portable and large enough to display good work.                    I am in position of an iPad 3th gen and now I got the iPad mini. It took me a while to decide on it whether or not I would even need it but having it for 3 weeks now I did need it. First of all for the money you get a high quality Apple product, which is fully capable to meet with the demands that are expected from it. The nice thing about the size is that it is exactly right for holding it in one hand without being to heavy or the display being to small. I hardly use my old iPad, which already says it all. If you are thinking about buying an iPad and you need a light tablet that is just as good as the big once I would advice buying this one. The batterylife is really good and the display also preforms good in he outside daylight. All and all it's a full Apple worth mini iPad. The only advice I can give for now is wait on the 15th of October because speculations say that on this keynote an new iPad mini will be presented with retina display.
!###We like it! I wanted the regular Ipad, but my husband wanted this one. I would much rather have the bigger one! This one is fun though and will get allot of use!                    I am very happy I chose the iPad mini. I replaced my older iPad and am really enjoying the new one.  Amazon detailed most of the information I was looking forward and made my ordering easy.  I would recommend both the iPad mini and ordering from Amazon.                    Love my iPad mini use it every day a lot of time instead of my laptop if you are looking for a tablet buy an iPad.                    Works great. Text is as good as regular iPad. I love that I can share games, appointments and info between &#34;i&#34; devices.Small enough to take anywhere, large enough to easily see.                    Just like new and it works perfect. Bought it used but the condition is superb, it was well kept i love it..                    Very easy to set up and very easy to use.  wifi only is sufficient for my needs, I mostly use it at home.  I use my Wi-Fi connection through my Verizon hotspot.  I use it to check my email, send and receive text messages, and for surfing the Internet.  I have also downloaded a variety of apps.  Battery life seems to be pretty good.  I have not had any issues with my iPad.                    What a great item this is. I did not want something that was large. I cannot believe all that I do with this ipad. Learning was easy for this old man. The touch screen works so smooth and I can navigate around like an old pro. This item is more than worth the money and I recommend it for young and old.                    Great product.. Extremely versatile! Shipped fast. A good alternative to the iPad regular size.. Battery life is amazing. A must for any apple fan.                    long battery lifefast!!User friendly,  less experienced users are more comfortable and have a more enjoyable experienceMy husband uses his new one for EVERYTHING from banking to watching funny videosI can read all the news while  I am in my recliner with a cup of coffeeWe Love Ours                    Had help getting started as I was totally unfamiliar with it. I do have a Kindle that I am pleased with but the Ipad is able to do so much more.  It is very easy to hold and move around in.
!###Is my 2 favorite gadget, my iPhone 4S is the best but tris is a excelent option for the work                    My girlfriend has an iPad 2 and I think it is great. However, I wanted to try the mini because I thought the iPad 2 was larger than I thought I needed. I was right. The iPad Mini is the perfect size between the iPhone and the regular iPad and I have found many accessories to go with it, especially in the car.                    Only ok.  Not as great as reviews would have u believe.  Actually size creates some reading challenges of websites unless you "speed" for readability.  Gave the Wife the regular iPad so I'll use this but a little challenging for my ages self.                    i got my product in 2 days that was very good i will refer this person or company to anyone                    I can not get my email to work.this is an important means of communication for me.my icloud feature is installed and working buy all email arrives on my kindle. Have reentered the information several times and it still does not work.happy with many other functions and features although I am not well versed in there use as.yet.                    I'll be the first to admit I used to hate apple with a passion. My girlfriend wanted one of these for xmas. I bought it for her and now I think I use it just as much as she does. The APP choices are spectacular and the clarity is amazing. It is &#34;MADE IN CHINA&#34; (shame on you Apple bring more jobs to the US) and the price is VERY high for this model considering that fact. But if you want a quality product...this is the way to go.                    the size and weight is optimal, but if you have tried retina display, its difficult to go backwards. hope the next mini wouldat least have same spec as ipad 3                    I haven't explored all possible applications yet, however everything I have tried is satisfactory. I had trouble with my messages at first.                    This was a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves everything about it.  Great product!!  She is continually calling me and telling me something new that she loves about it.                    I have the bigger IPad, this is easier to take everywhere, fits in my purse.  It is just a smaller version of theOriginal, with all content the same.  Love it!
!###It is as it stated... Love it! Easy to use, light to carry around in my hand bag, practical to have                    I love my mini iPad. It does everything I have to do.i mainly play games. But I also research and orders.                    Got this for the wife for her birthday. She loves it and takes it with her everywhere. And why wouldn't she? Its a Freaking Ipad!  It was LIKE NEW and looks and functions flawless. GOOD BUY                    Had this for about a month and it does what I want it to do, nothing wrong with it at all and 16GB is more than enough for music, and apps.                    Apple is amazing,it so user friendly,hardly ever crashes light and well made .Make everything else feel like a knock off                    I got an ipad mini, not from Amazon, but from a reward program, so was basically free. I received the 32GB version. I have to say it is an OK device, but overall, for screen resolution and overall sluggish performance, I still prefer my old Ipad2 and still, my Nexus 7 (first gen) remains king. I was hoping the ipad mini would satisfy my tablet needs, but it just made me want the new Nexus 7 32GB LTE even more...(if only Asus/Google could release it already!)Even I have to say that the edges on the face of the device are rough, not very smooth. I thought that it could be my device only, but stopped at two Apple stores in Greater Toronto area, to find that most Ipad minis on display had same issue.For those Apple fans ready to pounce: I own 4 Iphone 5, an Ipad Mini, an Ipad2, 2 ipod touch 4th gen, so I am giving an honest opinion here, I also own a couple of Android devices, but to me this Ipad mini seems under par...)                    Since I have an Apple iMac 27&#34; computer, and recently dropped our land line and bought an iPhone 5 with T-Mobile, I wanted all of my devices to sync together without any problems.  Since I was going to a reunion, I wanted to take some photos and slideshows that I created to take to the reunion and bought the iPad Mini from this seller.I was going to buy a refurbished iPad Mini from the Apple store but with taxes added from the Apple store, the new one was only $30.00 more and so I decided to get a new one from Amazon with prime time.At first, I did not know if I needed the 16 or 32 GB, but find that the 16 GB will hold everything that I need.  Since my iPhone 5 is a 32 GB, I did not want to spend the extra $100.00 for the 32 GB model.I would buy again from this seller, the product came quickly and I am very happy with my purchase.                    To me there is no other product better than apple items . They are indeed really well made. Their technical suupport staff is always there to help you!                    I am a late-bloomer in everything and have never even had a smart phone. I bought this for the initial purpose of a two-week trip to Mexico. It was perfect. I loved the huge view-finder for photos and the ability to zoom in and crop photos during editing right on the device. With the Audible app and some good foldable headphones I could bliss out on long bus rides listening to audio books or, of course, music. I didn't buy data, but wi-fi was available often enough to let me access my my home and work emails and book hotels or get travel info. as I went. I put a Snugg case on it and it was easy to carry around. I also bought a keyboard but couldn't get on the Internet when the keyboard was connected; however, I'm sure that's my own techno-ignorance and not the I-Pad's fault.                    I shopped around for a while looking to see which iPad to purchase before I finally made my decision. I brought my iPad as 'Like New' condition. I use this for school to take notes, record lectures and my personal downtime. They also take great photos and video. But video takes up ALOT of space. Charging cord and charger were also included with my iPad.I use these as protection for my iPad:Screen protector ( I ended up only using one of the three)Tech Armor Apple iPad Mini Premium HD Clear Screen Protector with Lifetime Replacement Warranty [3-Pack] - Retail PackagingSilicone caseAmzer Soft Silicone Jelly Skin Fit Case Cover for Apple iPad Mini - Hot Pink (AMZ94588)Case shock absorberrooCASE Super Bubble Neoprene Sleeve Case Cover for Apple iPad Mini 7.9" / Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7" / Google Nexus 7" / Samsung GALAXY Tab 2 7.0 (Black / Pink)
!###I love the iPad mini. It does everything it's big brother does.  It's the perfect size. I can put it in my purse and take it anywhere.  It's very lightweight.  I got the 64 GB so Ihat I would not run out of space.  This will be perfect for a plane ride I plan to take in a couple of months.                    It was great.  I also have an iPhone so I expected it would do all the same things, except have a larger screen for reading. My only problem was that I should have bought one with more memory. I ate up those 16 gigs fast.                    I had a bunch of American Express points and decided to spend them on purchasing an iPad Mini.  I knew it was the same as a full sized iPad, but smaller.  Well, the size is a bonus. It is easy to take everywhere.  It's light, it's fast. It's easier to type on it than the full-sized iPad, easier to hold, thinner and has surprisingly good sound.I'm completely satisfied.                    My husband and I ordered two black Ipad Mini's within an hour we received a phone call stating that the black Ipad's we originally ordered were all out. Yay! for us,because of this mishap we were offered a more expensive upgrade (saving us 40.00 more for each...a total of 80.00 saved) white Ipad minis AT NO EXTRA CHARGE!! (which rocks because we wanted white ones anyways, but were trying to stay within a budget. To begin with, white electronics always look more sleek, and beautiful (which is why they cost more, right!), the customer service was fast, prompt, polite, and just kick ass!!  A special shout out to STEVEN B who not only called us and gave us this offer but also sent us a personalized letter apologizing (but heck we ended up with such an awesome upgrade we were more than pleased) for the inconvenience, plus a follow up call to check up on the delivery and the products and our satisfaction. Steven B should be valued as an employee because his hospitality was amazing, and he truly cares for his customers- ~**~ eh hem~**~ give him a raise!! Seriously..... the delivery was fast, the service was great, and we are completely overly satisfied, Ipads rock, and we plan on buying another one next year for our kids!! Thanks so much, and chive on!                    I liked it because i have an ipad and our granddaughter wanted one.  She is using it almost constantly and adores it                    I always thought the iPad was a great idea for me but my fingers were way too small and the device too big for my liking. That was enough for me to hold off on buying it and looking elsewhere to get a device that fit my hands and my lifestyle, until they came out with the iPad Mini. I bought the Mini to read, and study for my GMAT exam.The small frame allows me to carry it around in my purse (no need for a monstrous tote) so I can whip it out on my commute to work. I can't comment on it as a device for gaming or excessive app usage since those are not the main reasons why I purchased the device. I can say it is light weight and convenient, and great for books. The iPad Mini is a great choice for the aesthetics and for the basic uses of a tablet.                    My son wanted this Mini IPAD so bad and my daughter got it for him. Ben carries his ipad everywhere he goes. He uses it more then his iphone 4.                    I purchased the iPad Mini as a surprise gift for my hubby.  He absolutely loves it and the ability to play games.                    had difficulty with setup and apple I'd, but once that was accomplished I am very happy with the convenience and the ability to have all of my data in one place and so accessible.                    The produc is Excellent, I am really sorprise how ease is play with this and how easy is carry up everywere
!###Great size, nice iPad! I'm so glad I bought it! Great quality! Very nice, easy to use and light. Easy to fit my handbag                    This is my 2nd apple product in which i purchase because I am a college student. I bought it so that I am able to download textbooks and also use for my personal business. Ipad mini works great and I am very happy with this product                    I bought it for two main purposes:  reading books and checking/sending email when traveling.  I'm impressed with all the other neat features though.  It does what I wanted and so very much more.  Once I became comfortable with various apps, I was set for much more.  I highly recommend this product.                    It's the perfect size, and it's got the Apple OS. What's not to like? Now that I own it, I very rarely use my desktop PC. I can do it all from this perfect sized Ipad, and from anywhere in or around my home with my wireless router. Absolutely NO regrets from this purchase.                    Went back and forth for about 4 months trying to decide to buy a mini or wait or buy a nook or wait or buy a kindle or so on... there are just so many tablets to choose from. Went ahead and invested in a 64gb model which I wouldn't normally do. Happy I did. The ipad goes with me everywhere and consolidates everything I need to do on my laptop as well as providing me much needed entertainment/productivity while I am on contract living in American Samoa. Yes, it can get boring here on the island and the iPad mini lets me read the news, ponder books, study topics, communicate, and basically feel connected to everywhere else in the world. Did I have buyers remorse? Only during the 2 weeks I had to wait for it to get here to the island---now I'm trying to think of a reason to get a black one too. :)                    I bought this for my husbands thirtieth birthday. He loves it!! Happy birthday to him. No complaints what so ever.                    Best thing I ever got I've got a iPod I love it it is fast I like it it is cool                    it came in a timley manner, box/charger/case was all in tact as promised. this was a smooth tranaction and we are very happy!                    The screen size is perfect and its weight is so comfortable. Can hold it with one hand so easily and the multi touch is smooth.                    This is my first ever ipad / tablet and I love it. Prompt, to the point, and so much at your fingertips. Excellent.
!###This I pad mini is great, what I like most is suri is on it and she knows she's the s***.                    I debated for a month between the Kindle, Android options and the IPad mini.  I knew from the minute it arrived that we made the right choice.  Satisfaction level with the product gets better and better the more we get to know the device (the only Apple product we own).                    I can't say enough about this Mini Marvel! It is feather light, yet as full featured as my iPad 2 - only faster. And, as with all Apple products I have purchased over the years, it is totally reliable and the fit and finish is second to none! What I don't understand is why anyone would buy an Apple product from Amazon. I guess a lot of customers are used to really low prices on the products they carry, but in the case of Apple, you are paying more than you would literally anywhere else in the US! Why would you do this to yourselves? Check out Apple.com first to see what a particular product should sell for, and then go to a reputable Authorized Apple Reseller, such as B&H Photo or MacConnections for the best price. Buy it here and you will be ripped off - mercilessly! CAVEAT EMPTOR.                    I was hesitant to purchase the ipad mini from a dealer because there were only stock pics and limited description but I'm very happy I took the chance. First, I contacted the seller to ask a question and they replied the same day with an answer so 5 stars for communication. Second, the product arrived in it's original box with the serial number of the device matching the packaging, this exceeded my expectation. Accessories were neatly stowed as if they had never been used. I could find no blemishes on the ipad mini, it looked like new. I took it by my local Apple store to have them check it out and they confirmed that it was like new. They were also able to look it up and tell me when it was originally purchased (Nov) and they registered it to me.I've been using the mini for a few weeks now and I love the size for convenience. It's extremely thin and fits in my purse. I had the Nook Tablet before this and find that they are very similar in size. I also have the iPad 3 and for regular use, I prefer the larger screen. I wanted the mini for travel and it will be perfect. Everything I have on my iPad 3 can be put on my mini so when I travel, I have everything I need. I bought the 32 gig and I currently have 7 full length movies and 25 tv episodes (40+ min each) in addition to 130 songs and 84 apps of which 16 are games so it holds quite a bit of entertainment. I have a little over 2 gigs available. My iPad 3 has 64g so I was worried I'd miss the space.The mini feels much more thin and delicate than my iPad 3 and my Nook Tablet. I worry about it breaking and wish LifeProof had a case out for it. In portrait view, the sides are narrow so holding it just there can be precarious. I let it lay on my palm with my thumb on the narrow edge for more support. The screen size is satisfactory and I've had no screen issues while watching movies. Many say if you are used to the retina display then this will disappoint but I don't have that problem. Movies display in wide width with the ability to increase the size to full screen by zoom. Sound is excellent. Alone it is fine on 5-6 level and with other noise, 7-8 is fine. Camera works with ease and seems to have the same functions as my iPad 3 including front facing camera, zoom and video. Apps made for the iPhone can be increased in size but a little visual quality is lost due to pixelation. IPad apps look great. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the product and the seller. I recommend and would definitely purchase again.                    Man this is an amazing product. Its better than the iPad, I would say. It's much easier to handle because it is not as bulky as the iPad. I feel that I don't even need a laptop anymore. With all the apps out there, I don't think we will be needing laptops pretty soon. This product makes your life easy.Compared to the regular iPad, the mini is light!!!  Now that i take a look at the ipad i think its way too heavy and uncomfortable, makes the mini feel like a feather. Hands down!                    I'm a certified iOS geek.  I've owned every iteration of the iPhone and iPad that's ever come out.  In Black and White.  I wait online and install the system updates (now OTA) the minute they are released.  I tell you this so you will know that I'm really fond of Apple's iOS products.So when the iPad Mini came out, I had to get it to supplement my new, new iPad.  You know what?  It has just not excited me.  It's really not that the 1024x768 resolution is bad, after all, with a smaller screen size, the pixel density increases slightly, but its certainly discernible from the retina display of the new iPads.I just find that the form factor is not so significantly different that I'm amazed and delighted by how much I can do with a smaller device.  Nor am I bowled over by its price.  The stereo speakers are there, but no more noticeably louder than my full-sized iPad with only one speaker.  It's really just there.  In other words, it's more of the same and does not give me the satisfaction of an all-new device.  Now, as I mentioned, I love iOS, and the new betas for iOS 7 will definitely spark some more life into this device, but as I look back and forth between my new, new iPad and my new iPad Mini, all I can do is shrug and say, "Meh..."Besides a retina display, what can Apple do to make me espouse the iPad mini as "magical"?  It's not hard... I want a louder set of speakers (my wife's 7" Kindle Fire HD has a booming set of speakers), native apps that not only replace or duplicate the ones on a full size iPad, but rather supplement them so if the two units are together, the functionality increases.  For example, what if any two iPads placed next to each other could extend the screen size?  What if I could place my iPad mini next to my full sized iPad and during Facetime, the iPad mini could show my own face full screen while the large iPad showed the other person's (instead of it being in a little window)?  Finally, they should drop the price by another $50-$75 or, god-forbid, increase the new full sized iPads by $100 to differentiate the price points.Right now, this fanboy is not the world's biggest fan of the iPad mini.  Will I keep it?  Of course, but just until the next one is released.  I have to own each iteration of these devices after all.  However, am I feeling more than just a bit lured by the new Google and Asus tablets...? You'd better believe it.  I'm looking for different, newer, better, more innovative.  One more version, I tell myself... but for the time, I won't recommend an iPad mini if you already own the full-sized iPad.  It's a downgrade.                    I bought this one for my mom since I couldn't afford the full size one. She LOVES IT!!! She loves the size and she is always using it. This was the best gift I have ever given her.                    The iPad mini is just perfect! I'm in love with the size and design of Apple's new version of the iPad.I'm in the Marines and when we're deployed, a light pack is a must and we face a lot of down-time. I had the iPad before and when I saw the iPad mini come out I had to give it a shot.I purchased the Apple iPad mini 32GB WIFI + cellular while in Afghanistan and it has been a perfect addition to my pack. It's light weight, I can fit it in my cargo pocket and 32 GB of space is plenty for my favorite TV shows and movies as well as all of my iBooks (20+) and days upon days of music to listen to while on the go.It's capable of everything the iPad was but it fits in one hand comfortably and typing on it is a breeze compared to stretching those thumbs across the screen like on the original iPad. I'd recommend this product to those looking to purchase their first tablet or those with an iPad looking to upgrade.**UPDATE**Cons:1. There isn't a retina version of the iPad mini, it shares the same characteristics of the normal size iPads other than the design and the power connector.2. Apple is likely to come out with an upgraded iPad mini in the Summer with retina so prepare to be behind the power curve as far as tablet technology.
!###You will need to have the updated apple iTunes to Sinc this with your computer, if your MacBook is too old to update iTunes, you will need to go to an apple store to have them put in the latest iTunes. Don't get talked into buying a later apple operating system ( snow or lion ) the apple story can put in the needed updated iTunes for free.                    I bought this after I purchased the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  The Kindle is heavy (same as the regular iPad).  This is perfect - I was afraid that it would be smaller than I wanted, but it isn't and I find that I use it more often than my kindle.  I'm more familiar with the apps because I have an iPhone (didn't have to repurchase any, like with the Kindle).  I would recommend this to anyone.                    i give 5 stars because it's all i was expecting. A perfectly done apple product that works all the time (until now). I have always been an apple fan and i love the ipad mini                    I've had the Color Nook, Kindle Fire and Nexus, and while there were features on each of them I liked, the only one that came close to the ipad mini awas the Nexus, but the ipad mini is just faster, clearer and far easier to maneuver than all the others. For me, this was just the one! I love it                    I love the portability but the battery doesn't seem to last as long as my kindle fire or my Ipad 2                    these mini's are very stylish and slim also light weight it will get your jobs done with exceptions such as easy connectivity to other devices non apple and this world of technology this quality can make you non grata                    Wi-Fi reception poor compared to my regular iPad.  Needed to be closer to router to be in Wi-Fi range.  Also found that Wi-Fi often got dropped and I had to reconnect.  Decided to return the iPad for this reason.                    LOVE IT EXCELLET GREAT JUST IN TIME. Great shirt no problems at all whit the product, thanks a lot friends.                    Ipad mini's size is perfect to make it easily transportable and easy to hold in one's hand.  It is very light and and portable.  Useable apps are easy to download and make the the mini a multi-purpose tool.  You can read the daily newspaper, get the news from many different sites, view weather including real time radar and use Google maps to find your way.  In addition, the wifi is great in the many businesses that provide free wifi.  I have a large itunes song collection and it easily loaded onto the mini.  As a senior citizen who still works part-time, the mini provides me with the tools to access much of the interests that I have become accustomed to at home with my computer when I am away from home.  Although somewhat pricey, I am impressed with its build quality and performance.  I have Verizon 4 G service with the minimum 2 Gigabites of service per month and find it more than adequate. I would buy the mini again.                    What can I say but I love it and use it constantly.  It is light enough to carry in my handbag , but big enough to read comfortably and has so many great functions(.  I use mostly the notes (I keep about 10 different notes for shopping lists, birthdays , anniversaries and other important lists for me. the calendar  I read books everyday with my Kindle app. e-mail., pictures and so much more.
!###I have always been a fan of gadgets.  When I was growing up, there were few gadgets around to satisfy my gadget need; however, since I have reached my "golden years" there are gadgets galore.  My first electronic gadget I bought when was when I was in college - the second time.  A chemistry class was making my little ole numbers-handicapped brain spin.  Then along came the Texas Instruments calculator...WOW, it ran on batteries and figured out things for me.  I was in heaven and so began my love of electronic gadgets.  As a professional I had a plethora of electronic gadgets at my disposal (and I still did anesthesia with a calculator.)  The gadgets did get more complex, and expensive, as I got older and I do have a "thing" for laptop computers and have owned several...I prefer to surf in my lounge chair, with the computer in lap, my feet up, and a tv show in front of me as opposed to sitting at a desk, etc. Then I planned a trip to Europe this year.  I wanted to be able to communicate with the folks back home without having to tote my laptop, so what to do.  Well, BINGO...you got it.  I needed an iPad!  And where do I go to purchase all my best "Good Gadgets"???  To my laptop and Amazon of course!!!  Didn't take long before I located my sweet, little, cool, white, handy-dandy, baby who computes from my lounge chair and any place else with wi-fi...and she weighs much less than the laptop, even fits in my purse.  With Amazon in charge and freebie electronics actually providing the product for my purchase...WOW, what a deal.  Amazon's usually lightening fast, but I had my little, cool, shiny, new, white, baby in less than 2 days - all securely packed and ready to rumble.  And so we have continued to do sending messages/pictures home from Europe, playing games (which I never did before), and reading my fav magazines...SUCH A DEAL!  Give them a try!  Yall take my word for it...it's great!  They're great.                    Very user friendly and easy to learn and operate. .  However my Apple Ipad Mini  does not take the place my Microsoft laptop.                    It does everything you expect it to do. I should have bought a 4g model. Wifi in my house is pretty spotty. I am planning to get a booster, which may increase my use. However, I do not like it as an ereader. It hurts my eyes after a very short time. I have enjoyed a Kindle better for that purpose.                    As i expected comes complete in a plastics wrapped box, with all his stuff in it, the iPad mini works immediately, arrive on time, and apple give us another quality product.                    It's an ipad. I also have the 4th gen ipad, which feels 5 times heavier. I probably should have just bought the ipad mini in the first place. It is easier to type on. My ipad 4th gen gets a lot more hours on the batter though.                    he ipad had small cracks in certain corners, it wasnt 100% clean but it was sealed correctly, dont really understand                    Great product. my kids love it!!!Its smaller and lighter than my old iPad 2, and even cheaper!!!Highly recomended.                    THIS PRODUCT CAME IN GREAT CONDITION, AND IN ORIGINAL BOX. ANYONE SEEKING TO USE THE IPAD SHOULD DEFINITELY TRY THE MINI. ID BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN FOR FUTURE PURCHASES PERTAINING MY ELECTRONICS                    Easy to use and provide all the connection tools I need.  It allows more mobility without compromising info and ability to respond.  I love the convenient size.                    It was a great buy for the new year. Every Apple store had the mini on back order. I ordered a brand new one for just a few dollars more plus shipping.
!###I bought my ipad for work and read books and just for fun. I really like how easy it was to get set up with my current AT&T carrier.                    Bought it for FaceTime to see grandson!!!!!!!!!!!  But use it for so much more!!!!!  I have a small business and it is perfect.  Plan on using Fact Time with my business!                    Love it love it love it, it's great have to get used to the smaller screen but love it.It has the same ability as the big one.                    So fast and smooth not to mention the quality of the screen. Put a drop resistant case on it and you would be set forever!                    I LOVE IT... EASY TO USE..THE SCREEN IS EASY TO SEE AT NIGHT & LIGHTS REALLY WELL...1ST TIME I EVER HAD ONE...IT ARRIVED ON TIME                    This particular item was just as advertised. Looked brand new and came super fast. I do not have a single complaint.                    This is my first iPad. I've owned every other apple item except an iPad. So i chose the mini cause its an excellent form factor for me since I'm going to college. It fits me very well and I enjoy it.                    This is a nice piece of kit, the screen is clear and photos and videos look really crisp, the OS seems stable and there are countless good apps and games in the appstore to keep you busy and entertained. Email works great and internet is great on a tablet. I found a great book on getting started with iPads Using iPad (Computer Training)                    This Ipad is the perfect gift for my mother who wants to stay in touch with what is going on in the world and for staying in touch with her family. Nice and compact. Shipping was fast.                    I got this for my 8 year old nephew. Love it so much I sent for onefor me,now we can face time each other!
!###I am using it to control the pool in my back yard. Its bigger than I thought it would be but you can see everything clearly when you use the Aqualink software to do what you need. Good price. Arrived fast.                    it wont charge after just a few short months, with apple chargers. I don't know how to go about getting it replaced under the warranty.                    Lots lighter than my full size version and well suited for traveling.  I mainly use this one for reading and surfing the internet.                    I had the first generation it was not for me needed a camera and at least ios 6 this looks great has all the new apps and is already asking me if I want to upgrade to iOS 7.0.2 nice size and very thin and portable had to get it for an early birthday gift I could go on and on about the good things this product offers highly recommended for everyone                    Speed is pretty good and unlike android technology,user friendly devise which I love it most.I will spread words to my friends.                    I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it. When the I-pad got here, she opened it up and started looking thru everything thing on it. she has a few books on it and really enjoys reading.Thank you very much from me and her.                    Other than not being able to work properly on files and manage files in an easy way - it really is great.                    This is my first apple product and am quite impressed.  It's fast, light, thin, and connects easily to wifi.  Perfect size for the kindle app as well, works better than most e-readers for reading purposes.  The screen is actually much larger than the 7" tablets with the standard aspect ration, and has a nice width to it.  The width to height ratio is more toward the width side of things than most tablets, which I strongly prefer and it means bigger text with news articles and less scrolling.  The resolution isn't great but it's fine because of the small screen.                    I have read quite a lot about Apple's corporate philosophy, and I'm just happy to know that their spirit is perfectly reflected through their products. Keep the integrity Jobs guys! :)                    I had a Samsung galaxy tab 2 7.0 and loved it till it nolonger worked, so I bought Apple ipad... Love it.  It is the reason there are so many tabs out now, ipad is king for a reason.  Long live ipad
!###When will I ever learn - Nothing beats an Apple product!  After several non-Apple MP3 players I finally bought a Apple Nano. What a difference buying it made.  Imitators never seem to make a product that can do what Apple can do (but I'm still a PC believer.). 2 years ago I bought a BB Playbook because I had a BB phone.  I soon learned BB had over promised. App development was lacking.  Same thing with the Amazon Fire I brought a year later. I had high hopes for their Fire HD but alas the apps I needed weren't available for the Fire HD. I also heard the $50 annual 4G connection was only good for the 1st year after that AT&T would charge outrageous rates to keep the 4G connection. Seems like the critical apps I needed were only being developed for Apple IOS.  I checked used pricing and was amazed that even broken Apples were going for what a new true Android went for. That speaks well for Apples resale value. I've had my mini for a week now and I'm not sorry it's soooo much better.  I chose the mini because I prefer the 7.9&#34; size over a 10&#34; model.  Sure the model 4 has a faster processor and retina screen but for double the price I paid for my mini those improvements just aren't worth it.                    I like most of the features of the mini. I am no techie so my input is limited but the unit has a poor wifi antenna. Apple denies it but it is a fact. Check online postings by other users. Also, apple prevents the downloading of adobe flash making some websites less useful                    Very well made, makes the mini much easier to hold on to.  It does add some considerable weight but that's the price for protection.  Very nice feel and grip.                    I purchased this for travelig and I think it will be a perfect to replace a laptop and e-reader.Love the size and convenience.                    Researched a lot of ipads and settled on this one because it has the latest technology but is smaller and less expensive than the newest regular sized ipads.  My son got it for his birthday (he is 10) and loves it!  It is actually pretty big.  I expected smaller.                    Acquired on PRE-ORDER, received on Date of Release.There has been many discussions as either to call it a reduced IPad or a glorified IPod Touch / IPhone. I can say from experience, as I have all of the three other items as well ... It is not fair to classify this item as either.Yes, it is true it is an intermediate size in between the 4-5 inch Touch-Phone and the 9 inch Pad. But with exception to certain other characteristics, it is for a class of its own. The pod/phone can't really be considered feasible for VIDEO Entertainment. For that the PAD is the only really feasible unit.Now, if I already have the big pad, why would I go for the mini as well, ... In summary .... Portability .... Plain and simple. I take it and stick it in my back or side pocket of the 24-7's or the inner pocket of a jacket .... And it is like unnoticeable. That's one thing I couldn't do with my regular IPad.Would I prefer the mini to the regular ... For communications and browsing and book reading ( for which I consider the 4/5 inch Pod and Phone way too small) sure, it is fine. But I still hold on to my IPad 2 for video entertainment, because, as Jobs put it, &#34;for that purpose, anything less than a 10&#34; unit is too small.&#34;.For regular users, I suggest a SCREEN PROTECTOR, and a HARD CASE, preferably with screen cover as well.But in summary, a highly recommended item... You won't regret it.                    I have to love it, its not as big, bulky and heavy as the regular iPad yet its big enough to display text and still be readable without forcing your eyesight (I'm 43 and beginning to get presbyopia).                    We are loving our mini. Its great for work and my daughter loves to use it. There are so many good apps.                    Seller delivered on promised time. This Is a good tablet for internet surfing, movies YouTube etc. it nice and small fit well in one hand                    I love the mini because I am a small person and it fits just perfectly in my hands.  Better than the normal size.
!###Bought this for my son as a birthday present.  Just like every other Apple product I have owned, it works flawlessly.  Easy setup, easy to sync from his old broken iPod.  He loves this and takes it EVERYWHERE we go.                    Bought this for my son, he loved it,I loved it also,  It's is great.  I'm  getting one for myself now!!!                    I am exremely happy with it. I am using a GSM SIM card from an overseas provider and it works just fine, even though it is a Verizon pre-installed unit, it supports GSM just fine. In fact the best buy if you want to use 3G or 4G is the Verizon because it has the widest array of mobile telephony bands.Mine came preinstalled with iOs 6.02 and it is already jailbroken. Sweet!A great product. No regrets. It was not very difficult to adapt to the smaller screen, having used a regular size iPad. It is very bright and clear.Battery duration is quite good. Wi-fi is solid and no problems so far.                    I bought a mini keyboard also which makes a great little portable computer.  My potable computer had aged out and this makes a great tool for note takig.                    I love it so much that this is the second one I buy! I have one already and my two children were fighting over it so I bought another one my children love it and can work it easily I have a 2 and a 6 year old! I love it also the apps are great and it is a great size to travel with I just slip it in my bag or purse and go! I did get a protective case for it though since my children play with.                    I bought this mini to replace an Ipad2 I traded in for a windows surface (which I Love too) it holds all my music, apps, I use it in my car and work for everything...For me it is a much more solid piece than any compariable Samsung product                    As you may know, this is my first iPad I got with my own money, and it feels awesome. The screen, I thought was going to be to small. Turns out, it's just perfect. The battery life is just amazing. I can leave the house at 7:00am and don't have to put it to church until I'm ready to sleep around 11:00pm. I use it for school and it's so convenient when I have to go sing at events I have all my lyrics in one place. I am a happy person.                    was contemplating the nexus 7 or a Samsung. after playing with all 3 I decided on the mini. its the perfect size. the 7 is a bit too small.... makes it feel like a bigger cellphone. the 10&#34; are too big; might as well buy a small laptop. the mini is right in the middle and the perfect size @ almost 8&#34;. light, great for travel, and does everything I need.screen is great quality and speak is not bad for a tablet.I bought mine used on amazon and it came in perfect. not a single scratch on it. would highly recommend.                    This iPad Mini exceeds my expectations in every way.  I initially made the purchase so that I could read in bed, but quickly discovered it handles most everything else I need to do.  I almost never look at my laptop these days except to load music (which automatically downloads to my iPad) or sort through photographs.  It seamlessly loads everything from my iTunes account and connects to my Apple TV.  I bought the Wi-Fi only and so far this has not been an issue for me.  I suspect that down the road I will purchase one with a data plan and retinal scan.  For those of you who are undecided about which iPad to purchase, I personally love my mini!  I found the regular-sized iPad to be too large for my liking, i.e., a bit bulky to carry around.  I am extremely pleased with this purchase and the seller shipped the item to me promptly and well-packaged.                    My wife has the full size iPad, and we both love using it, but this smaller &#34;Mini&#34; is a little easier to handle and travel with. Being an Apple product, the design, fit and finish are top notch, and there are tons of accessories already available for it. Battery life has been very good, and the apps have been designed to work perfectly with the smaller screen of the Mini. Even though it is a little smaller, it is easy to use and all of the apps are easily viewed on the crystal clear screen. I would recommend a case that can be used to prop up the iPad, so that you can view it easily while watching videos or web browsing. Everyone in my family enjoys using it, from my youngest to the eldest, they find IOS very intuitive and easy to navigate at any age. The learning curve on this is very flat and gradual to anyone that doesn't know Apple products. I recommend an iPad to anyone wanting something bigger than a smart phone, but smaller than a laptop. There are great apps for business, banking, planning, gaming and everything else in between to make life more organized and more fun for the user.
!###this is a another great product from apple. I own different tablets and this one has many advantages as well as some disadvantages, but for the most part each tablet is unique in its functionality.                    Ipad is the only apple product to get heavier and hotter with every generation.  Everything else gets slimmer and cooler and thankfully the ipad mini has been redesigned from the ground up to be the slim sleek product apple is known for.  Unfortunately they used cheaper tech to lower cost while charging a premium for a small tablet.  If they had matched the specs of the larger ipad OR charged less to better match the pricing of other 7" tablets I'd have one right now.  Yes it is true I do not own a mini, but I have owned an ipad 2 and played around with my coworkers mini.The following are from my brief use of my coworkers mini and so this is not an in depth or long term insight on this product, but I think many of the points are valid.PROS:-Size, weight, thin profile - all considered standard on most apple products.-Lightning connector... it's true they have hosed everyone with their new connector but their old standard 15-pin was becoming dated... too large and not reversible.-OS is streamlined and comfy, those that own apple products are at home and folks that are not tech savvy are more comfortable with this OS-Tons of appsCONS:-Pricing considering that android competition is selling at $199-OS is limiting. No where near the customization available to android users.-Stereo speakers are welcome, but not when they are placed one inch apart, come on apple...-Itunes is a pain (not as bad as Microsoft, but still cumbersome at times)COMMENTS:-People keep stating NFC is a con.. it's an apple, get over it. buy an android product-People complain about lack of Retina display.  Get over it, the pixel size is still comparable with the ipad 2 and the goal was portability, not pixel density.INNOVATION:I think apple would benefit from incorporating GPS into every product they sell and then offering free 3G for all location services, no email, no internet, BUT free location updates for all those apps that rely on location services.  Maybe your comments won't post until you get home (or a free wifi location), but you would get the benefits of integrated gps for accurate navigation and location info.  Off my soapbox.-                    I have a hard time reading the Mini, screen justto small, enjoy the full size Ipad, should have ordered another full size. Ordered this one thinking that it would be more convenient to use but, but even with the text size at the largest setting its hard to read, other than that it functions just as well as my Ipad  16 gig full size ipad                    Got this for my husband for our anniversary and he already has an IPod, but I thought he could use that for all his music, he loves that thing, and has so much music on it. but I thought that by getting him the tablet, he could transfer his games, pics, and whatever else he keeps on there to the IPad Mini. I about died when he kept it!!! He's a very difficult man to buy for! We've been married 29 years, so I was like I'm going for it, I can always send it back with Amazon. But he loves it!!! I don't use it, I have my own stuff. Kindle Fire HD, which rocks and we both have Iphones, so you can't lose with an Apple product!!! He's on it every night, now he's buying more music for his other device and has what he needs on his IPad Mini. And it's so thin, so if we go away, it goes in our Electric Gadget bag, with our chargers and it's awesome!! And on the day I bought this whole package, the IPad Mini, the case that shuts it off and turns it on, and the protector sheets, I paid under $380 for everything!!! It pays to be an Amazon Prime Member!!!! You get the best deals, no hassles on returns, you have 30 days to return something, and if you have a problem, all you have to do is call them!! I love the ease and the customer service!!! I've yet to have any kind of issue with Amazon!!! For this whole package, it said 2-3 days max for delivery!! It was here the next night at 5pm!! I was shocked!!!! But, it was here and that's what I love about Amazon!!! They ROCK!!! Now reviewing all the books I've bought for my Kindle, I'll try to get to them!!! LOL I already have tons of books, and every single day I get BookBub in my Email and it's the books on sale or FREE books!!! Amazing....I love them!!! I do most of my shopping on Amazon and because I'm a Prime Member, I don't pay for shipping. I hate going to Malls...you get better prices on here for Bluray movies, electronics, kids toys, and shipping is free as long as it's a Prime item. I've talked enough!! Amazon ROCKS and I'll always come here first before I go anywhere else.
!###I really spent a lot of time researching tablets before I decided on the iPad Mini.  The device is light and because I purchased the 64g it can store all the music, movies & e-books that I have. My wife who so  isn't so keen on tablets uses it regularly with ease.  Good bang for your buck and practical.                    It is just what I expected. I would recommend it to everyone. It is handy to use anywhere you are at.                    Excellent item I will recommend this to others because:Overall experienceSizePortabilityScreen definitionQualityPriceCloud service... etc                    I have anorher ipad, 3 ipods and and iphone & I love all of them. Easy to use. I wasn't sure about gettint it in white but it looks great.                    IPad mini is a lot of fun to use, the price was very fair. Product just as described. I use it all the time. Delivery was very fast too, I recommend this seller                    First I got a Kindle- charge connection broke , Got a Fire-charge connection wouldn't stay connected. So we gave up on them and got an Apple, Can't telll much different yet but only had three days. Seems fine, nice size, easily read, everything transfered.                    The day it came I ran out the door to get it. When I opened the package it was just as advertised, perfect condition. I bought it refurbished, and the battery doesn't really last ten hours but I'm assuming it is because of the previous use. My only suggestion would be to include an item history with refurbished products, where it came from, any previous use, etc...It does everything I want it to, and more than I thought it could. Very pleased with the item and with the service.                    Excellent product. I changed my Ipad2 for this Ipad mini. More confortable and simple to travel. Really, it was an excellent decision.                    I have the standard size ipads but i bought this one with verizon just for out of town travel and to use it as a gps unit on a screen i can see in our motorhome. I wanted a pay as you go tablet that would cost less than having to turn on an air card for for a week here and there                    It is fun and easy to use and performs all functions I have need for. Would recommend it to anyone.l
!###I received my iPad mini in the mail about a week ago and have been nothing short of impressed. I had previously owned a first generation Kindle Fire. At first I had planned to purchase a 8.9 Kindle Fire HD but after I read the reviews about the ads and Skype-only camera, I decided to look elsewhere. A few days later, I heard that the iPad mini had been announced and decided to get that instead. I purchased mine directly from Apple rather than Amazon due to the cheaper price tag for the WiFi only and AppleCare. This is technically an iPad 2 crammed into a smaller size with the addition of the new Lightning charger and Siri. But it is far superior to my Kindle Fire in every way. I can do everything I could do on my Kindle Fire and more. I suggest if you're hunting for a tablet, ditch the KF lineup this year and pick up one of these lucky charms. They have a bigger price tag, but its worth it.                    Love the iPad mini.This was the perfect Christmas gift. I would recommend the iPad mini. The size is very convenient.                    This device has been great for me. It has a ton of great features and is very easy to use. Great device at first glance.                    The best tablet out there in the Market today, Very smooth and quite fast. Another great product from apple...also the resale value on apple products are great...                    It's an Apple, it's smaller and it's great!  I like it better than the iPad because it's smaller but have all the cool functions as the iPad.  Siri works great, too.  Love it!!                    Great product! Love the size and great gift for the wife and her daily business ventures. No problems or issues                    i've had the iPad mini for about a month now and i find myself addicted to it.  the compact size and light weight makes it very ideal to bring around so i take it everywhere with me including office, business trips and personal use.  cannot really find anything to complain about other than not having the retina display, but then, the smaller size screen kind of compensates display quality.  perfect holiday gift, in fact, i love it so much i bought a couple of units more as x'mas presents.  happy holiday~
!###Excelent product, i love it, it's just something that i want for some time and is for my wife, i'm sure she will be deligthful using it                    I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband. He loved it. It is everything he wanted. His only complaint is that he wishes apple products diddn't require an internet connection to set up in the beginning.                    I love this ipad mini and it really serves its purpose!  I certainly would reccomend this product to anyone who is looking to purchase an ipad mini!                    I carry it everywhere with me . I  mainly use my to read and play games.  It looks absolutely wonderful and is very easy to use . It can be linked up with your iPhone as well. Many wonderful feature. Highly recommend it .                    THIS MINI WAS BOUGHT FOR SOMEONE, AND THEY WERE REALLY EXCITED, IT PUT A SMILE ON THEIR FACE, I WOOULD RECOMMEND THIS SELLER TO EVERYONE.                    Shipped fast.  I have bought many electronic gadgets and must say this is one of the best and most versatile.  It handles PDFs nicely.  The only thing I don't like about this tablet (as well as all others) is the LCD screen, which I hope changes in the future.                    I  have not review before,because i did not have the time,but I have to say that apple always give us what we needThey  go just at front list when we say technologyThak you!!!                    I wasn't sure how I would like the mini after having a larger iPad, but I really like it.  Fit's easily in my purse and charges quickly when needed.                    I actually bought this for a friend and he loves it. I have one myself and love the size because it fits in my pocketbook.                    I have a 7 inch android tablet that I really like, but had heard so much about the Ipad that I just wanted to give it a try. I chose the mini for the price and the size, and I have been extremely happy with it. The slightly larger screen adds a little more viewing area without making the tablet too big to go in my purse, and I have found that a couple of the apps I favor seem to run smoother in the Ipad than on the android.
!###It was not clear that the iPad mini has no 3G.I brought to Brazil and, surprise, there is no 3G slot.Maybe you should be more clear regarding this and consider that AMAZON sells beyond US, so, communication should include an international perspective.Aylmer                    we did not receive our purchase! the box was not taped shut and arrived empty. We since sought and got a refund and bought an iPad Mini through Apple direct and thoroughly love this product.                    I ordered a white mini ipad, and the package i recieved has a black mini ipad.  very disappointed because i dont have time to return iteam were flying this weekend and needed a ipad quickly to download movies and games on for two toddlers.                    Nothing revolutionary or innovative about making an iPod Touch bigger.I will stick with my Nexus 7..Sorry Apple but that's how it is.                    ok, to start of with, i have never bought a apple product in my life. so when i got this i wasn't sure of what to expect. so i unboxed it and was a little perplexed by the things inside. Obviously it came with the ipad and charger, and instructions and stuff. i was just about to throw away the box until a flash of light caught my eye inside the box.stickers.in the shape of a apple. I immediatly threw all the other stuff down and grabbed the stickers( which cracked the screen of the ipad:( ). i was just amazed by the worksmanship of those stickers. i was so amazed by them, i even gave them a name. jagsby. me and jagsby ended up going to the movies together and watched startrek. then we got bored so we decided to use the power glove i had to go through time and beat some people up. but on one of the people had a kniife and was about to stab me, but jagsby blocked it resulting in him getting cut. this made me so angry i killed the man with my d1c6. he died from a snapped brain stem and not being able to process the godly powers of my d1c6.i teleported back to my time with jagsby, but it was too late. he was gone. i'll never forget jagsby. he was my best friend. but. the 530 bucks was worth it, but only for the stickers. i wouldnt recomend the ipad. he cant lift                    The description was misleading it said it had a Simm port in Additional description.The store needs to check what info is on it                    What's not to like about this cute iPad mini.  Well-designed, packed full of features, perfect size for easy carrying in purse.
!###I had been thinking about buying an Ipad, but once the Ipad Mini came out, I started to consider that instead simply because it was a more convenient size. It fits perfectly in my purse and is just the right size for my rather small hands. I can see how a guy with big hands might have an issue with the Mini... Its worked perfectly right out of the box. I don't really use it for work or anything like that, its just a play device, really. Though I run all my finances off it too. We have two in our house now and no complaints from us. I love snuggling up in bed and checking my email or watching a movie on it. Its just the right size for that sort of thing.                    An older friend of mine wanted a &#34;pad&#34; she calls it so we both made a deal that I would sell mine to her at a discounted rate and she would give me enough for a mini so that's what we did! I don't regret it! I love my mini! I use it everyday and to me since I've been simplifying my life for the last year or so this was a great investment for me because &#34;Less is More&#34;! I can do everything on my mini as I did on my iPad 2 with no problems! No regrets at all! No complaints here! :)                    My ipad mini can do everything i want it to do, and takes up less space than the ipad and i like it better.                    This &#34;mini&#34; iPad is no baby brother in the family.  It delivers the same visual quality and accessibility as those that came before it.  The price is right and you can carry it anywhere.                    I love this ipad mini despite it has not the retina display or a faster processor. It is light, slim and nice comfortable screen. The best device available for reading purposes. I guess the white color is better as the black is sensitive to finger prints.                    I love the ease of use on the keyboard, the size and weight are perfect for laying in bed reading!!!  The light weight make it very management and yet the screen is a perfect size.  Wow!!!!  You outdid yourself Apple!
!###I love my new mini! It fits perfectly in my purse and is still big enough for me to see what I'm doing and get lots of work done!                    Very light and portable. I love it. The full iPad experience in a smaller version. The big iPad is too big for my taste. iPad Mini is perfect for watching movies, reading books, surfing the net, shopping, and listening to music. People complain about the screen resolution but I don't have any problems reading or looking at it. You can notice a difference if you have an iphone. But its not a huge difference. Its wonderful to have a small tablet. Apple has done exceptionally well with iPad Mini. Go for it, but it if you can.                    The best way to describe this iPad, is to say it puts the world at your thumbs! I was a diehard PC. Got tired of viruses and other issues. Once you take a bite out of an apple, you never go back!                    I love this product.  I like the mini's smaller size over the iPad.  Great product. I would highly recommend it.                    This is a wonderful product. It is excelent to use to work and free time. I am very happy with my buy.                    We already own MacBooks and wanted something smaller to take on trips. This is IT! It has all the features and available apps of the full-size iPad and is another outstanding Apple product!                    I've had the 16GB Mini since November but was running out of room because I'm loading so many apps. I even had to remove some of my Kindle books and Zinio magazines to make room. Now, I won't have to worry about running out of space.                    It has the perfect size to be carried with you in your bag or bag pack. Very light, so you don't feel like adding weight to your daily activities. Haven't used for long time, but I had great experience whith other Mac devices.                    had ipad 2  moved to the mini and i love it  was surprised about siri too perfect size for travel                    This product is amazing and so cute. It is very light, I ordered it in black and looks really slick, the graphics are great, couldn't be happier. I even use it for sketching with my bamboo paper, netflix, skyping on the go, and even for presentations to clients while having lunch (I'm a graphic designer). Two thumbs up.
!###It's everything I wanted it to be.  I have an older iPad and knew what to expect.  I just wanted the smaller size.                    Love it was very quick getting here and everything they said it would be daughter has a brand new toy                    Great teaching tool for children with learning disabilities.  I purchase the Ipad minnie as a backup for his Ipad 4....he likes the Ipad mini better.....who knew...lol.                    The iPad mini was a great hit with my friend when I gave it to him at CHristmas.  It works great and looks wonderful.                    Love it !  Wish the font at the top and sides could be made bigger.  The main page can be enlarged, but he can't see the top bar and side bar very well.                    todo muy bien responsables ................llego a tiempo .... .. .. . . .. .. . . . . . .                    love the nice slim look, not heavy when you traveling a must have when youre always on the go and need the internet
!###First of all I need to say that this product arrived perfectly on time. It was as brand-new as you would have bought in the Apple store.The product itself is a top class technology. iPad Mini is very mobile, which is the biggest advtange over the regular iPad. It has all necessary and far from necessary functions. Battery life is absolutely amazing. Display quality is not as high as retina, however, you will not even think about its bad sides. If you are an iPhone user and this is your first iPad - you will need to get used to the little specifics of the keyboard on Mini. 1080P HD video is just a beauty to watch. No lagging whatsoever, just pure class. Overall this is a high class product that will let you feel the whole world in your one hand.                    This is perfect for reading(kindle), checking email, storing and editing photos, etc. I have an iPhone and an 11" macbook air. This is the perfect in-between. I Amos happy to have this for travel.                    Sent this item as a gift for my Dad and Mom.  They love it, especially doing 'Face-Time' with all of their children!                    I had wanted an Ipad Mini for a while. I have a 10" android tablet but it is a bit heavy for reading my Kindle books on. It was also not as easy to connect to free wi-fi hot spots. The mini is super easy to connect to the free wi-fi connections at my favorite coffee haunts. I have an Ipod touch but it is just too small to read books on for long periods of time. It is fine to quickly check web pages but not for prolonged browsing. (Aging eyes) I debated about waiting for the predicted "retina display" on the Mini 2. On comparing the retina display Ipad to its non retina-display counter part I decided that the difference was not THAT great. The only time I could tell was on video playback. On that I could see a substantial difference.The retina display Ipad was MUCH better. Since what I want to use the Mini for will be #1: Reading my Kindle books and #2: Web browsing, I did not feel it was worth a possible 6 month wait for a retina display mini. I bought a keyboard case so that I can type emails easier on it. Will I regret not waiting for the retina display mini? Maybe, time will tell. If you are forever waiting for the next great thing you will never buy anything.                    Great product, lighter and very fast!!!Also excelent battery life!Its greater than kindle fire because it runs a fully loades operating system instead of a shrinked oneInternet browsing is as smooth as a computer plus extremely portability                    I have had the original iPad for a couple of years now and found it was time to upgrade to something a little more current in terms of OS.  So far, I have really enjoyed the smaller size without feeling like I was giving up too much screen.  I use it mainly at work and reading in my spare time.  Overall I have enjoyed the downsizing.                    Love it Especially the size. Great resolution. Great for traveling with it. Easy to handle and store while traveling. Happy I chose it.                    10000 more portable tan the regular iPad. Love it! Now I use it more than my previous conventional iPad. Great buy.                    This is my first mini ipad and I love it!!!!!! The speaker is great and needs no extra speakers for sound .Graphics are the best.And great color. It takes great pictures.And I can play some of facebook games with the ois.The battery last for a long long time even when the light stays on. Walmart is a lot cheaper I paid 299.00 and it's that price daily.I also love Apple products.I would reckamend this to friends .                    It is the perfect size for me.  It suits my purpose and I think it will be sufficient for my use.
!###I have a 4th generation Ipod Touch 64gb and an Ipad2 16gb.When the ipad mini was announced, I wasn't impressed.  I was fully satisfied w/ my ipad2. Only thing that was making me consider getting the mini was its portability.  With the ipad2, you have to have it in a case, plus a bag if you don't want to accidentally drop it...plus setting it up, etc...Well, I ordered the mini last week and I haven't been able to put it down!!  I absolutely love this thing!Unexpected surprises...- the weight...it feels like you're holding a piece of cardboard...it's light.- the speakers...they're loud & it doesn't matter whether u place it on its front or back, u can hear them perfectly...and u get stereo speakers that sound soooo much better than my ipad2 and louder, clearer, etc...  I've been listening to music on this way more than on my ipad2...- the cameras...front and back...they are a very nice upgrade and the back camera is nice b/c it doesn't matter whether u take a pic, light or dark, it comes out nicely lighted and clear...  isight camera must use every available slither of light to give u a decent pic in just about any bad lighting situation, which is unexpected coming from a tablet.-typing...for some reason, it seems soooo natural to type on the mini... it's a one and a halfer by its size, but it feel effortless-screen resolution...after reading endless reviews about the mini NOT having a retina display, I almost didn't buy it...BUT I love this screen...it is tight, crisp, and I have no problems reading...in fact, the videos that I watch on here are INCREDIBLE... so, for those of you on the fence about the screen resolution, it's a non-issue as far as I'm concerned...don't cheat yourself, like I almost did...I've been watching videos and finishing them in one sitting...that's how nice the screen is...I see things I didn't notice on my ipad2Sadly, I haven't had the desire to pick up my ipad2 since I got the mini... I will have this thing for a very long time... Oh, and if you decide to get one, get 32gb or 64gb...I have the 64gb and I absolutely love it!!!                    I bought this to help me with school work.  It ihas so many great features.  It is just the right size for my hands.  It had great resolution, so it is easy to see and read.  The camera takes fantastic pictures.  It is easy to use and customize.  There are so many free and inexpensive apps to use with it.  This is a great iPad for anyone.                    Very great product fast shipping! As soon as it came in i started to download apps and browse the internet everything is working fine and fast very slim and lightweight!                    There are two schools.1) The Apple way2) The Open wayIf you want an environment where you can work seamlessly in all aspects without &#34;hurdles&#34; of upgrading this, upgrading that, is it compatibile with this, do I need a service pack xyz, etc, etc. You know what I mean, Apple has it all.Sure once you're in, &#34;you*re in&#34;! Some call it &#34;locked in to&#34; even &#34;trapped&#34;....well fine.Until anyone else will bring it all together I see no need to look elsewhere for a bigger screen only, faster CPU, only, more MegaPix only etc, etc and to have it &#34;open&#34;.Last but not the least, the Apple gadgets whatever they are simply look stylish, design cool & sleek in all ends.                    It did not come with a cable, no big deal I just bought a new one. iPad is in great shape and does what I need it to do. 4 stars                    My iPad mini is a fully capable iPad; it's just smaller. That makes it more portable. I'm still looking for the perfect planner app to complete my intended usage, but I'm confident I'll find it eventually.                    The best invention yet.  We love it in my family  I bought another one so we can share more in my family.                    For me it is the best size. My iPhone is sometimes too small and the original iPad is a litte large. The screen is very clear and easy to read.                    I have had my iPad mini since day one. It's the white 16 gig wi-fi version. The screen quality is perfect. The size is perfect. The speed is amazing! I do not think you will find a product like this anywhere but Apple. And for the $329.00 I paid, it has SIRI, stereo speakers, microphone and FaceTime for the best video chat in the industry. A steal at the price and despite Amazon brushing the product aside because they sell readers, this is the best of the best. This time Amazon may not be the best place to but this product. Compition makes it underwhelming until you get to the reviews! Get one from Apple or wherever and you will not look back!
!###Just a quick note *I bought this item on Ebay so it will not show up on here*This Ipad is awesome....I am going to sell my Ipad 2 to my brother...but I was impatient for him to get the money together so I hopped online and bought one (after vigorous reviewing of course). Man was I happy...Because of the smaller size I find it a lot sharper looking than the Ipad 2 (not the 3 and 4 because it is lacking "retina".) But I have not noticed a large difference between the quality of the iphone 5 screen vs the ipad mini.  Also, the wifi connection is out of this world, I can get signal in places that none of my other gadgets (besides my laptop) can reach!I give this an easy 5/5 for a tablet, I am not a fanfail or whatever they call it now-a-days I enjoy all systems to a degree but absolutely love Ipads.                    I'm an old salt as far as gadgets go but after much pondering I decided to join today's technology generation..boy did I waste lots of time.  This tablet has made things so convenient for me; I can do so much more than just read books with it.  I was undecided for a long time; should I buy a Kindle or iPad? Well sure glad I went with the mini iPad, so much I can do with it.                    It is perfect. It got here fast and the price was unbeatable. I would highly recommend this company and I will use them again                    I bought this for my fiancee for her birthday and she absolutely loves it, she can't put it down...I think I made a good choice.                    I am enjoying my iPad mini. I can now carry everything I have on my iPad in my purse. The order was delivery with promptness and in great quality.                    I've had the original since it first came out and I still absolutely love it and still use it daily for ready books on kindle and consuming news before bed.  The only reason I decided to get another iPad is for facetime.  The mini works as I would expect and the only thing that I do not like is I feel like the battery is somewhat weak compared to the original iPad.                    I had an original ipad and thought it was very nice but the size of the mini is perfect.  I've used this product everyday since I got it.                    I am no where near a tech guru.  I have a Samsung Galaxy Stellar and  a Windows based Dell PC.  So purchasing anything Mac is having to learn to do things differently, of course as far as compatibility with apps, etc.  This is a treat for my senses and I love it.  I am just starting to scratch the surface with all that you can do with this product to begin with.  I graduated just before computers started to be used in schools and became the norm for the generation after me.  I learned on an Apple but haven't been able to afford them since. I am good at learning as I go I am not afraid to press the a button and ask questions later to get to where I want to be so I do travel somewhat dangerously but for me that is how I discover the best things on an unknown device.  Push and read directions late is my motto.  Haven't ruined anything irreparably as yet.It is more enjoyable for me and I do understand the price range in comparison to my experiences it does seem fair.  I do think that the Mac offers a much cleaner, organized, classier, user friendly....etc. etc. version above the competition.  I had no idea that the things I can do on this even existed technologically so that should tell you I'm somewhat jaded from lack of my limited tech frontiers and how much things have really changed since 1984 when I graduated.  Trying to keep up is hard because it keeps changing faster and faster.  So I'll hang on until I'm to old to care or remember what my password is.                    I love my iPad-mini.  I use it primarily as my reading device and for web browsing.  I also watch Netflix or Amazon videos on it and use all my banking apps.  Great user experience!                    The iPad mini 64gb is my 3rd ipad...I've had the first and second ipad and I loved them. I will admit I was the main person saying how stupid it was for apple to come out with an ipad mini and I was wrong! After reading reviews I decided to upgrade my 2nd generation ipad to an ipad mini and I must say I'm impressed. When I went to the apple store I looked at the ipad mini and ipad 4 and I didn't notice a severe difference between the retina screen and ipad mini screen. I love my mini it's so light weight and I put it in my purse and literally take it every where. I use to do the same with my ipad 2nd generation but it was very heavy. If you're looking to buy something that is portable light weight and to replace anything that you already have this is it. I'm a college student and I use my mini more than I use my laptop...I have my textbooks on it write papers read powerpoints listen to lectures and record my teachers in class on it. I also read books magazines and watch tv and movies on it as well as playing games and sketching. "addicted to sims and cut the rope". My roommate and I have figured out how to do so much on these ipads that we barely use a computer or paper anymore. I would highly recommend this ipad to anyone. I don't feel like I "down graded" at all by replacing my ipad 2 with my mini it was a great trade off. I love it and hope that my review swayed any doubters into purchasing. I'm truly obsessed with it. Griffin Technology Survivor for iPad Mini, Black/Black (GB35918) &lt;&lt;&lt;--- link to my favorite case that I highly recommend as well.
!###When I first saw the iPad mini I thought people would be crazy to pay $329. I thought you'd get a lot less in a tablet but spend more money. I was very wrong. After just one day I freaking love this thing. It's such a high level of quality in a smaller size that I could see paying $349 for it. It's almost freakishly thin and light. It might be alien technology actually.I picked up the white version and its fantastic. Awesome aluminum back with a very sharp chrome bezel around the front edges. Even though its not a retina display I have no problem with it at all. The picture quality is still great and the colors and images totally pop. At a foot away you wouldn't know the difference.Great to read books. Great to surf the Internet. Great for sending emails and texts. So solid feeling. It doesn't fit in any other category of smaller tablet. And maybe that's the point. Apple chose to go smaller like the other competitors, but at the same time they paved their own path. I'm using this more than my big iPad now.                    This is a great iPad mini. Almost the perfect one but thereis no perfect.... The battery life is also amazing. Should be good for personal and or buisness use                    My iPad mini is very great!!  I'm having great experience with it just after opening my iPad.  I have never had a iPad before.  But, since I have a iPad, I have notices what huge feature I had missed with the iPad!                    I am a huge apple fan and really love the size and portability of the ipad mini. I travel a lot and the mini fits perfect with that.                    Apple iPad mini is good to carry outdoor, even I have new iPad . It's lightly and smoothly to use                    Small and thin, just what i wanted. Great for reading books. The weigh is perfect. I only taught it came with headphones                    While a little more pricey than other tablets, I actually prefer the smaller size and it makes it easier to carry around.  I use this for my ebooks for school                    Just as the other products of apples. It is the representive of iPad.Lighter than others. You can hand it when you lie in the bed. Surfing with you fingers.                    Nice device! Smaller, lighter than iPad, but very fast as iPad New.Great Apple! Good job! Bravo Jobs! Apple forever!                    I have an iPod Touch I can't live without. I use it everyday. It is not the newer one but I was thinking of getting the 5th generation Touch that has the retina display or the mini iPad even though it did not. I have an iPhone 4S so it does not have the retina either. I was really leaning towards to the Touch but decided to get the 32 iPad mini in white.I bought mine at a store that has BB as the initials and they also have an offer for a free Belkin cover/case that I love! When I unpacked it, it was mostly charged so it did not take long to charge the rest of it. I thought I would have a hard time converting over from the 30 pin connector but have not missed it.I own an Acer tablet that is too big to hold and heavy. My 4th generation iPod Touch is too small so I am glad I decided to go with the mini iPad. It is literally just right! It feels good in my hands, does not weight much, looks gorgeous, and is so easy to use!If you are on the fence like I was, I don't think you will regret it. I would get the 32 over the 16 though for it is only about $100 more and double the space. I have a 16 iPhone it filled it up in five months.I am happy I own it and regret not getting it sooner. If you are unsure, try it out in person and you will see what you are missing out on.
!###Connection speed slow, and the auto correct spellings is a pain,other wise I like it,it came  in good conditionl I would buy nother                    I got regular iPAD. But got this anyway, thinking it is more convenient to carry ti around. not disappointed. thanks Apple.                    I would recommend this mini ipad to everyone! I gave it as a graduation present to my son and he absolutely loved it !                    I want to start off by saying I usually despise Apple products, mostly because Android offers more for me (like the Amazon AppStore with its Free Paid App of the Day) and is less plain and boring. But I opted to buy an iPad Mini because it was on sale at Walmart for $299. I was going to get the Nexus 7 for $249 but thought for my money the iPad Mini was faster, had a better display and can do virtually everything I'd want or need it to (sans the Amazon AppStore). And I believe I was right.The iPad Mini is the perfect size, being not long and skinny and not perfectly square. It's not too tiny and not overly large. It looks like a giant Galaxy Note II running iOS 6.  It is stick and snappy, loads and plays videos spectacularly, takes great pictures and has a lot of good free and paid for apps that will suit anyone who wants a tablet to play with or do business with.Coming from a Nook Tablet (non-HD) I can say I'm very impressed with this one; how it looks, how it feels and how it performs.  It can do all my Nook Tablet does, and more,  I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase.                    Great apple product, amazing clarity and easy to use. Fully meets my expectations in every way.I would recommend this product to anyone interested in getting one.                    I have been wanting one for the longest time and always thought the regular iPad was a but large. This came out and I was like &#34;woah&#34;. I am SO SO happy about my purchase, if you want one...GET the Mini...AWESOME!                    Love this size! Amazing product. I did fine that my USB cable has already came loose on one end which makes me sad after what I paid. I would recommend a case that when you are using your pad has a handle on the back. Makes it so much easier to use.                    This  was to replace my iPad 2, I absolutely love the light weight and the clarity of the picture on it.                    After hours of tablet research, It came down to quality and price, and this product ended up being chosen, but it should have been a no-brainer. It is the perfect size for anyone. Whether you use it for reading, gaming, business, school, or personal use, this is easily the best tablet you can purchase under $400. I wouldn't recommend anything else.                    Very nice!  Small yet gets the job done,  it shipped quick and secure with no problems. I love it.  4g works great as well.
!###This is my first time to have an ipad mini, I came on time. It's handy and easily to place on your bag. It's great!                    theres no word to describe this piece better than reg ipad and perfect for carrying whith it bateries last much longer than iphone way more and size?? perfect                    Mini has the exact size to fit in your hands. Light and beautiful. Makes the regular iPad feel cumbersome.The HD cameras make Facetime look great as well.                    The iPad mini is the perfect size.  I am carrying and using it everywhere at work.  I can not recommend it highly enough.  If the size of a regular iPad has put you off, the mini will be vanuish any such thoughts.                    I purchase this item for my grand daughter she has not put it down from the first day she got it . She can now keep I touch with family and friends research school projects and play games and much much more                    I Love the ipad. I play all my games on here and am able to keep in touch with friends on the go. the camera and photo booth is my favorite app.                    i really enjoy my new ipad mini. love it have a lot of fun with it. My little newphews love it.                    I've wanted an iPad for some time, but just couldn't justify buying it.  But when the mini came out, it was just perfect!  PLUS, it fits in my purse!!                    I love apple products and this isn't any different!  I almost went with a kindle, but i really enjoy how if I purchase something on my iphone it automatically goes to my ipad!  I am a very happy customer!!!                    I enjoy this even more than the regular IPad I had  before.  The size is perfect.  very good graphics and storage
!###I highly recommend it. It is an awesome item. I love it. It so easy to use. It is very fast and works very good with any wi-fi connection. It is one of the best thing I ever had!                    I paid a pretty decent price for the ipad and it came in perfect condition. There were absolutely no delays in the shipping. I was actually shocked that it came in so quickly, probably less than a week. Overall, I am a very happy and satisfied customer!                    ProsLove that its small but not to smallLooks greatFastBattery lifeConsNoneOne thing I want to see for apple is to lower the price.                    So light and well built with tons of apps. My wife got the full size and I got the mini. I find the mini so much more portable.                    It's very lovely, thin, and petite. I could not be happier with my purchase. I use it for class. And it's spectacular                    This is everything I wanted and more. I love it! It is small enough to carry with me but big enough to surf the net without difficulty!                    It has worked just like I was told it would! Thanks you and please continue to supply good products for us.                    No problems, so nice, the sending ok, iPad in the best conditions, secure, seved, I recommended, this new iPad is really so great                    Great size for me - preferred it over the regular iPad size - it fits in my purse so well, so that I feel comfortable taking it anywhere with me!  Excellent screen, cameras, and Skyping/FaceTime - I really have no complaint!!                    Tengo el ipad 3 y queria uno mas peque&ntilde;o y portable y este es el preciso. Muy contenta con esta compra
!###What a great toy . I still am trying to figure out how to work the many features. Love to Skype my grandkids and watch old movies on Netflix. Have not figured out how to download my video documentaries. The movie camera feature is a real blast. This might be the gadget made for us old folks. I bought the mini ipad hoping to find a replacement for my old Zune. It is on the road to extinction as I am and I wanted a device to store my library of video documentaries. I would watch these videos while waiting on my wife while visiting her many doctors. I bought a Kindle Fire but it did not have the capacity for storage. It looks like the Mini ipad will fill the bill. I would like to watch movies from Netflix and Amazon but the doctors' offices are not rigged up for waiting spouses' comfort as yet. As soon as I can figure out how to configure the format for my videos for the mini ipad I will be really happy with my purchase.                    i loved it! light as a kindle but with all the functionality of iPad 2. surprised becausei thought this was just a quick way to sell more tablet but there is a good use for this smaller form factor.love it!                    ABOUT THIS REVIEWERI'm a Prime Amazon customer. In this household we use Amazon to shop for all sorts of things.  I am an early adopter and love tech, but as we have come to rely on technology more and more, it has become less of a toy and something that simply has to work all the time, whether for an online web conference or for the kid's homework.ABOUT THE iPAD MINIConstruction: I was getting ready to write this review and managed to set my iPad mini on a bar-height kitchen counter top precariously, and it fell to the floor.  Hitting a wood floor no less.  Happy to report nothing happened. No scratches, no dings, operating just fine.  Didn't plan to start by writing about the construction of the iPad mini, but this is a device you'll move around a lot, take in the car, stuff in airplane seat pockets, cram into backpacks.  This thing is amazingly light, but built like a tank.  It can take it.Use: It is a joy to use.  Clear screen, easy operation, all the features work all the time... And of course you can find an application for just about anything.  Here is the best part, if you have more than one Tablet around (we have a couple iPads in the household), everything works the same way on the regular and the mini sized iPads.  Even better, using one account shared on these devices means that we only have to purchase an App once and we can use it on a couple different iPads.Choices: My wife prefers the larger iPad for email and my teens like the larger one for movies and drawing, but I love this mini size for travel.  It's just personal preference.  You can argue specs all you want, but basically the mini and the regular sized iPads are identical in function, battery life, apparent resolution, and so forth. The only question is your own preference as to size and weight. (And the Mini is less expensive than the full size.)Apps: Email is a breeze, web browsing is simple and quick, and if you are into photography, this little gem offers an amazing still shot and video camera. And with all those apps it can be just about anything from a network diagnostic tool to a book collection, from a banking tool to a game pad, or a weather forecaster to a music player...COST OF OWNERSHIPWhen it comes to picking a Tablet, think about the purchase price over time. I have PC netbooks in the house that lasted less than a year.  Most of the PC laptops lasted 2 years or so.  But the Apple products simply don't quit.  We have an original iPad that is as good as new, and Apple desktops and laptops that keep getting handed down from one family member to another because they don't stop.  Yes, they are more expensive to purchase at first, but we save a huge amount of money because they keep working for years and years.  We don't have money to waste, that's for sure.TOTAL ECOSYSTEMAnd here is the real decision point, at least for this household.  It's all about the ecosystem, or the suite of hardware and software that work together.  I'm no longer content to have a cool laptop, or a great Tablet.. I want it all working together, and this is where Apple products shine. We have personal and family calendars that update on our phones, tablets, desktops and laptops.  We do the same with email and magazine subscriptions and so much more.  We can share photos and music on all of these devices and on the TV as well (hooked to an Apple TV box). We can save files "in the cloud" and access them from anywhere, anytime, on any device.  This is how it is supposed to work.  My son is into programming and finds the Unix-based environment of the Mac to be the best place to work.  My daughter is into photography and has professional-level tools at the ready.  My wife is doing genealogy research and helping the kids with school (and life in general), and I have a company to run.  It's all on this integrated, connected, suite that works all the time, without nearly any effort from me to keep it running. And backups?  All automatic and all in the cloud, and yes, I've had to recover from backups before and it worked like it was supposed to.As I said at the start, we use Amazon Prime all the time. Love it. But I want the technology in our household to be what we want it to be, not a constant reminder to buy more.  Really disappointed that Amazon created their Kindle Fires as a way to sell more stuff. And yes, you can turn off the adds (by paying to do so), but not the recommendations. Beyond that, though, the Kindles and Kindle Fire are not part of an overall solution that can work together.SAFE and STABLEWe used to be a PC household, but that required 10 to 15 hours of month of "tech support" time from me to keep the computers and laptops and network operating.  No longer. It just works.  I also appreciate that the UNIX backbone of the Mac OS is less susceptible to viruses and the like. I don't have time to worry about the problems that Android phones are having now with viruses or hackers either.  True, all platforms can be attacked, but we are dealing with orders of magnitude here; the Apple world is more locked down, but in return I get more stability and we spend less time making it all work.CUSTOMER SUPPORTBack to this theme of saving time.  I love the fact that I can open up my iPad or my laptop and reserve an appointment at my local Apple Store with a few clicks.  Walk in the store, have the person up front confirm my arrival and be working with a decent tech person in just a few minutes.  I've had nothing but great service, and several times they went well beyond: as with older machines that were way past warranty but fixed at no charge, or the time I had an iPhone with a scratched camera lens. Replaced on the spot, no charge. If you are honest with them, they will be with you.So, that's our story.  Hope this has been useful for you in some way.                    love it and paid $329.00 plus tax = 348.74 from the Apple store! ITS A awesome product for sure i have all apple products as well  only way to go  thanks                    My husband bought this for me when it first came out because I own most things Apple. Despite my being a huge Apple fan, I wasn't sure I'd put this to good use. In the past month I've really come to love this thing.First off, while this does not have the advanced retina display of the iPad3, it produces a very clear and crisp image. It makes this the perfect device to use as an ereader because it can be held in one hand, yet it has the full functionality of a full size iPad minus advanced retina display.The speedy processor makes this lightening fast and unbelievably responsive and zippy. I use this just as I use my iPad2 and that means I can use it not just recreationally but also for some vital business functions. Like my iPhone, it keeps me in touch with my mail as well as the net while being easier to manipulate. If an app works on the iPad it will work on the Mini..I like the screen size which is just about perfect for a portable device that can fit in my hand and in a smaller purse. In fact, one of the reasons my husband popped for this is because it is comparable in size to a Kindle and is really portable and does not require a special carrying case, etc.The iSight camera, at 5 megapixels, is great. Produces clear and vivid pictures without any distortion.The all aluminum body is solid and the mini's construction is flawless. It is razor thin and weighs in well under a pound.I like the Lightening connector, but that does have a downside in that this is not interchangeable with the 30 prong connector that powers all of my other devices except the iPad4.Another new feature I like is SIRI. All you have to do is depress the screen button to activate SIRI which functions as a personal assistant. I'm still learning how to use it, but it is great to be able to access information with verbal commands.My only real complaint re: the mini is its price. It seems about $50 to $75 too high for what it is and how it compares to other tablets out there. Still, if you are a happy Apple user you'll pay the asking price.Ideally, this is best utilized by people on the go. It really suits my lifestyle since I am usually all over the place. Since there are hot spots everywhere I go, it is never a problem to find free wi-fi.I am updating my review nearly three months later. I really love this baby iPad. I'd be hard pressed to say whether I'd toss my iPad4 or my mini if I had to make a choice. I also have come to view the mini's price as fair given its quality and ease of operation. Of late, my Mini has gone everywhere with me. It is so compact, convenient, and discrete that it adds no appreciable weight to my purse and I can even carry a smaller purse now.  I love this thing. It makes me smile a lot.                    I bought new Ipad mini for my wife's birthday gift...but the happiness gone by seeing Ipad not charging well...The issue is with Ipad charging, for first time I put charging after the product got arrived, its worked. From Second time on-wards its giving sound and charging image blinking by making lot of noise...And tested Ipad by putting different chargers and some time its worked and for some its not worked.. So I realize its a Hardware issue in Ipad. Called customer service and  confirmed same...The shocking news is, I bought Ipad on Sep-10th and called customer service on 12th, they confirmed that there is no warranty for Ipad which I bought from Amazon. Technical support asked me to pay $199 for 1 yr ipad support(for any technical issue). Really all shocking things were happened in 2 days of having Ipad. So returning same and I hope nobody should get this issue again. Also lost hopes on buying any Apple product from online sites(other than Apple Inc).                    I love my iPad Mini.  I was using my iPhone for everything you can imagine and it was draining my phone battery.  Whenever I got a call, it would kick off my game or whatever app I was running.  Now that I have the iPad, I pretty much only use my phone as a phone and I can talk while still using my apps.  Another thing I noticed while using my iPhone was the considerable amount of eye strain it was causing.  The larger screen on the iPad mini is perfect.  I also like the size of the mini versus the regular iPad.  It's small enough to tote around with me where ever I go and it sits nicely on the couch arm if you have a case that props it up.  I highly recommend the iPad if you want a larger gaming area for games such as Hay Day and Candy Crush.                    Works great and it's convenient.  Small and easy to carry during travel.  Very easy to use after I got some tips from my grandchildren.                    This was a gift for my wife on her birthday. She always wanted an iPad but didn't like the larger display because it didn't fit in her purse. This is basically a smaller iPad 2 with similar features, same processor (Dual Core A5), and cheaper price. If you are a fan of Apple iPads its a great buy.
!###Received as required. The product was brand new and sealed in it's original box. Excellent product. Thank you very much.                    It bring everything they say, I brought one to DR and this machine are simply excellent! You will like it too.                    I love it because it is easy to operate and works just about the same as my desk top computer.  I highly recommend it.                    Great for storing pics to share w/ family members & holidays - no more dragging around old school photobooks.Great for streaming tv shows/movies via WiFi accessability.Great having kwik internet access via WiFi in a rush - - vs. - - booting up a computer & waiting, waiting...I'm still trying to figure out if I can download movies I've purchased on DVD, which I'll get converted digitally to the Cloud.  If I can - it'll be perfect for keeping busy, when needing to kill time (airplane trips, Drs apptments, wife dragging me shopping....)                    I love this product. I have had no issues at all with it.... I know others have complained about you tube but I have had no issues at all with it....I think that it might be their Internet connection speed......                    I brought this mini for my wife and she just loves it. It's a great size and weight...I would recommend others to invest.                    The best facebook and email product.. 1000s of apps that work, easy to use and did I say everything works right out of the box.                    Excelente el detalle es las aplicaciones de edici&oacute;n de texto que se bajaron de la Apple aunque se compraron adi&oacute;s hacen perder luego de la edici&oacute;n texto complejos por ejemplo cuando se editan documentos con pie de p&aacute;ginas este se pierden al grabar el archivo.                    The form factor of the ipad mini is great. I owned the ipad 2 but I sold it so that I could get the ipad mini; best decision I've ever made. It just feels right in your hand, and even though the screen isn't retina it is noticeably better than the ipad 2. The wifi is also better than the ipad 2. This is by far the best ipad yet.                    In hunting for MP3 players for personal use,  it seemed like most were over priced for what you get.  I have an iPad with retina display for work, and used and iPod touch before that to  take  to conferences.  For home I wanted something with a big enough screen to watch movies  while traveling, and the usage of apps is seamless among Apple devices.  For now, it is probably  the best device in its class on the market today,  in my opinion, but the price is still more than its competitors.  Apple should be able to make this with a retina display, and get more storage on iPads in general, then they would really be able to  fill a niche between laptops and hand held devices.
!###Fast. Stable. Easy to use. I could not have made a better choice for a tablet.  Use it and the nexus 7 before you choose the screen scale that suits you most.                    our son uses this for middle school assignments.  Alot of kids do these days (yikes).  He likes the extra gb and it's very handy both for school and for travel (he is on travel sports teams).  He loves it.                    I used to think that the iPad was better than the iPad mini but I was wrong. This device, even though it's small,  can do everything a computer can do. It has bright colors and the graphics are really nice so when my brother is playing minecraft , the screen is super clear and the buttons are easy to use {unlike a real phone it is hard to text}. When I listen to itunes or Pandora, the music sounds super clear without the headphones{unlike the iPod}. Also the iPad mini is super light so I can hold it in one hand and my hand won't get tired. When I study for tests and exams, I use siri/notes and when I talk on notes what ever I say  goes on the paper. It makes it easier to study. This device has great memory and loads super fast so if you buy a game or music it takes only takes a few seconds to load. There are  small things that I don't like about my iPad mini. When I am using the internet or Google, I can barely see the print. Also, it is complicated to set up Imesseges if you don't have great reception. Overall this is a great device and I highly recommend.- Olivia                    I brought the Verizon version for its hardware. I read the Verizon version will work on other carriers but the same is NOT true of the ATT - so for me its was protecting the resale value.Love the LTE speed.I got the 32 Gb version since the 16 is way to low for me for the books and magazines I read.In a pinch I can use the tethering feature on it if my cable goes out and I dont think verizon cares - as long as I dont suddenly spike on my data usage.  The same cant be said of ATT.The ipad itself is so much easier to handle.  Its sooo much lighter than the regular iPad. after using it I cant get over how heavy the 10 inch one is.I also had a regular sized 32Gb iPad 3 w/ RD. and sold it to get the asus transformer prime. I got it since it had one feature I wanted, the expandable memory. I loved the Prime at first but it was glitchy and got slower over time.  But it was never quite as smooth as polished as iOS. I guess google needs to work on improving their "photocopier".I started using my wife's iPad one day and just kept using it since it was so much smoother and it never froze up like the prime.I decide to get a mini since it had just come out and it was cheaper. I got the 32 Gb LTE version for a little more than the base regular wi-fi only ipad with 16 Gb.The non-retina display is not a big deal for me even though I had a iPad 3 and a iphone 4 (replaced w/ a 5). The resolution IS better than a non-retina display iPad but not as good as the ipad 4 w/ RD. Bottom line its good enough to watch movies and view pictures or magazines on.The mini with LTE is the perfect size for using as a gps in the car.  Its way bigger than almost all gps provided in any car right now. Plus it doesnt cost +$2K like it does as an option on a car.Its also the perfect size to use to control my TV as a remote for Apple TV, Comcast (although I have the wrong cable box right now), ...Cons: The only down side thats important to me was the lack of expandable memory. But I did find a fix for that.  I use a Seagate GoFlex Satellite Mobile Wireless Storage 500 GB USB 3.0 External Hard Drive STBF500101 Black. It lets me stream wirelessly up to 500 Gb of movies, music or whatever to my ipad.  It even works if I dont have a wi-fi signal since it generates its own signal.  And upto 3 devices can watch 3 different movies at the same time. pretty cool.                    This device was in real good shape and the kids love it.  This is just the right size for viewing.  Easy to carry with you when goin gto places.                    Just your regular ipad mini.  came new. works like new. I was pleased with the service with this product. I might buy some more                    I have an Apple iphone so I wanted the Apple Mini Pad.  I also have a Kindle Fire and it's very nice, I'm going to give it to my grand daughter for her b'day.                    Easy to use, efficient, excellent battery life.  I prefer to ipad 2 I purchased 6 months before this because of convenience.                    I love my iPad mini. I hardly use my laptop anymore since I got it. It goes every where I go.                    This little beauty has all the functionality and is so much lighter! Great for on the go anywhere!  We love it!
!###Everything I expected!! Love the mini! Arrived just in time for my birthday gift for myself! Five stars for sure!                    I bought this on a whim and because i was giving a cash Amazon gift.  I love my ipad mini, i didn't realize how much i would use it.  Great purchase and super fast delivery.                    I gave my husband my ipad2 which was just too bulky but the ipad mini is a perfect fit even with my Surviver case (similar to but better than otterbox).  I can carry a normal sized purse instead of a huge one. Best product ever! Love it!                    I was hesitant about purchasing the iPad Mini due to it being a smaller iPad 2 (spec wise) and the lack of the retina display.  However I was in need of a tablet after getting rid of my older iPad (due to size).  And after considering the other options in the same size range I picked this one up due to having so much money invested on apps and other iTunes goodies.  I didn't want to repurchase the same apps, or similar apps, again on another store.The size is perfect.  I have never owned a retina display device but have seen one and really wish that this had it, however it wasn't a deal breaker for me.  Speed wise, I have not had an issue.  I own an iPhone 4s and it is on par with it.  I don't do heavy gaming.  Mostly work productivity and reading, as well as the occasional Netflix/Hulu.The only thing I want people to beware is that many sellers are increasing the price of the iPad Mini and I wanted to warn consumers to not waste there money.  Apple and other websites sell the iPad Mini at MSRP ($329 for the 16 GB WiFi only model) and free shipping.  I can't imagine why other places are selling it for $70-100 more and charging for shipping.                    I have the regular iPad, but my wife wanted something she could carry with her more easily. She loves the Mini.  Mainly used with the kindle app for reading, and it's great.                    i bought this as a gift for my son for christmas and he loved it. he is still getting much pleasure from his ipad mini.                    Very good product for everyone..I'm glad I got it for me and one for her.I can't wait til the new one comes out                    I purchased one of these for my wife as a Christmas gift.  She has enjoyed an ipod touch for several years so this was a super nice upgrade.  Very sleek, smart and easy to navigate.  Very nice product.                    I love this product! I have gifted this to my sister and she is liking it a lot.It is very light in weight and the clarity is fabulous.                    I love my mini iPad. It was the best purchase of 2012. It came before the estimated arrival date which was a nice surprise. I would definitely purchase again from this seller.
!###I like to read and Ipad mini is perfect for me.I've been waiting for one with Retina displa though but couldn't wait any longer.It's incredibly light and it fits my hand just fine tough i was a little bit disappointed with smart cover: it adds substantional weigh to ipad                    I already knew ipad, but this is the first time I have an ipad mini.  I love it's size and weight!  Just love it...!                    I am a gadget junkie.  I buy and sell my gadgets all the time.  This tablet will be one I hold onto for a long time.  The screen is a perfect size, the size is so light and portable, the camera is great  and while I absolutely loved my ipad2, this one is even better.                    You will never regret buying this item.it is a tool  used in different aspects of our daily life. No regret.                    Just as powerful as an ipad, but lighter and easier to carry around.  Its not the same multimedia experience because the screen is smaller, but its an awesome gadget.                    I think this ipad is ways better than the previous ones. Yet, i do not find it as fast as a laptop. I need to restart it to make it function better. I have to say that I did not add the verizon option, yet because I am using it with available wi-fi I have at home. But overall, it has many applications that I need for myself and my baby. He loves to see some programs for a few minutes daily. I would say 5-10 mn. I do recommend it for anyone who needs a tablet to facilitate reading and writing on your pdfs. It will not replace the printed book, but it helps a lot to have that boost to keep it going in a pleasant way.  It is just fabulous!                    Works great ,easier to carry than a laptop. Just what I needed for traveling. Easier to read than my iphone                    Very happy with the product purchased for my hubby.  He is learning to use it.  Very user friendly for some who isn't computer savvy.                    I just picked this up and I have been very pleased with it. Other then the normal stuff this thing can do, I can administer my Windows, Mac, and Linux machines all from this iPad. SSH, RDP, Apple Remote Desktop, etc. It pretty much replaces my laptop and it will be even better when I get my SHARKK Apple iPad Mini Keyboard Bluetooth Case Cover Stand. I was a little concerned at first about not having a Retina display, but it looks great to me and if non-Retina keeps the cost down, then why pay extra for what I don't need. I also like that all my premium paid for iPhone apps transferred over to my iPad Mini. I was on the fence about the cellular model that also has the GPS, but I didn't like the price difference. I decided its cheaper to just buy a Dual Electronics external Bluetooth GPS receiver.                    though nowhere near as open as my nexus 7, i really like the ipad mini, plus the apps with the apple store. I love the size and feel. Great product
!###My I-pod was losing battery strength, so I bought this as a replacement.  My old eyes thank me.  It does everything my little i-pod did, plus, it has Siri and I can now get away with saying a lot of things to it that I used to have to type on that tiny screen.  So, it's all good.                    I love my mini me. I carry it everywhere with me. Listen to music, movies, I read all the time. I still love my kindle fire and my kindle paper white. This however has great apps for all different things. Fits into my satchel, cross-body bag, back pack, my favorite companion on trips.                    iPad Mini is an excellent Apple product, is more portable than regular iPad so you can carry it with you almost everywhere. Very light and comfortable for reading books and other docs, you can easily edit or create new things using it, as so for making notes. The only limitation would be not having a SIM card adapter, so you must have wi-fi to use everything at 100%.                    Of course I love the Apple iPad Mini.  It goes everywhere I go, does everything and is especially terrific for travel.                    It is the solution that apple need it  The size is what finished to motivate to buy it. It is so compact to carry anywhere.                    Got this as a push presy for the wifey who's preggers .. she loves it so much that i can now watch Speedvision uninterrupted WooHoo !!Great size.. not too big..not too small. if that's what you're worried about..dont.. the original iPad should have been this size.. wayy better.                    I was a bit scared about not ordering from the apple website but this is the way to go. I got a brand new ipad mini and with the money is saved was able to buy a case and screen protector .                    It is a fun thing to have. I like the camera. I went from  a desktop to a tablet, so there is a little bit of a learning curve, but it has been an easy transition. Looking forward to learning more.                    It is very portable and not hauling my laptop everywhere is a nice relief.Did not have any problems with it and did not experience it being used by someone else.It was brand new!                    Same excellent camera as iPad3. Superior 4:3 screen ratio. Half the weight of iPad3. The 163 pixels per inch is well suited for this device. If you have difficulties reading small text on labels then you will love the camera. Take a close up photo of the label and then read the fine print without difficulties on the screen. Like a magnifier glass but better. Negatives: -will not charge from a regular 0.5 amps laptop USB port. -almost too big to be carried in pants pocket. Summary: way more practical for taking photos than iPad3 because of smaller size and weight. Much easier to read emails and attachments compared to iPhone and iPod. I'm glad I got this one for $299+tax at big W.
!###Is beautiful in black, practical size, and have all the same features ofa normal ipad.Easy to carry with her, and transport every where.Excellent choice.                    This is the first time I have owned an I pad so I cannot compare it against others ipads I chose the mini due to size ... I love it I never turn my computer on anymore. I did purchase it on amazon but waited until I got it for what I would paid through apple. Does everything I want. I purchased the first kindle fire and was disappointed in the apps I do on Line banking did not have my bank  App. And many others that were not available . So it know belongs to my 6 year old granddaughter .. Spend the extra money get the iPad mini.. Ask yourself what you need it do. Do your research and find what works for you.                    I purchased this item as a gift and it was perfect. A great product between the iPod and iPad, perfect picture, perfect size, and again, a perfect product.                    I like the iPad Mini so much that I sold my first iPad to a relative, and now he's enthralled with it. I have had the first iPad since it came out, but the Mini does everything the full size does and more. It has a very good camera and it has Siri. Siri doesn't amount to much for travel, because you have to be connected to the internet to use it, but it's a nice feature at home or at a hotspot. And best of all, it only weights about the same as a large paperback book.                    I had an iPad 2, but I didn't use it much. I loved it mainly because I could download all these wonderful syntheziers, and music applications. I would occassionally use it at a restaurant when eating dinner, or while waiting at the DMV or soemthing like that. Sometimes it came in handy at home if I didn't want to turn on my computer and watch youtube videos. But this is not an iPad 2 review, sorry. But I was not using that much because it was heavy, and bulky. I would put it in my backpack, and after awhile that would get old. So I wanted to get this smaller tablet, which is really what I wanted to begin with.Immediately after trying it, I realised I had made a good move of selling my iPad 2. It was a joy to use, and I found myself enjoying configuring it, and downloading apps just like the old days when I would configure my old computers. I have at least tripled the amount of time using it, because it's so handy.Now there are some slight compatibility issues with apps designed for iPad. Mainly they have to do with not being able to read the really fine print on some of the synthesizer apps. Once I figure out what those virtual knobs and buttons are for it's not a problem. Sometimes it will be difficult to tap on a really small button. Hopefully developers will quickly adopt and come up with iPad mini optimized apps, but that's not really a big deal, I just need glasses, and a stylus. I think it would be a good idea for Apple to sell a stylus with it at a discount to make up for this slight inconvenience.The display looks nicer, because I believe it's more pixels per square inch, so scrunching all those images down makes it look like a high end 7" tablet. Also I'm glad they made it this size, that's well thought out. If it were a smaller 7" tablet it would be too difficult to use. At 7.8 inches or so it's perfect. I would not recommend everyone going out and selling your iPad 2 to get this, but if you don't have an iPad yet, and are looking for something more affordable, or more compact than an iPad 2, or iPad 3 etc, then this is a great option to have. I'm not sure how many of these have sold, but I would not be surprised if it were a hit, and a retina version came out. As far as improvements that they could make, I am mainly interested in a faster CPU, and a MicroSD slot.  Also, I had some accessories like the Line 6 Mobilekeys 25 keyboard that used the old 30 pin cord. So I will have to buy an adapter. That is one thing that kind of bothers me about Apple is hidden costs like that. But I love it!                    The iPad mini is the best because don't sacrifice anything and has a more managleable size. It is a success..!!I will recomend it to everybody.                    I bought this item b/c I didn't want to deal with the delay of apple. When I got it I immediately started using it and as expected it is a great addition to my apple product family. If you ate in the hunt for a great tablet this is the way to go and the retailer offered great service.                    Hours of enjoyment! Great times for anyone, and my man loved it.  A little more expensive than purchasing it from the store, but the convenience of not having to find a parking space and deal with crowds was well worth it.                    This is the review of my 12 yr. old daughter. I edited it a bit:  First of all I would like to thank all of those people who wrote the reviews that guided me to find the perfect tablet:) I had changed my mind many a times, first from android then to Apple's iPad 2,etc... But finally, I was sold on an Android. Asus Tf300. It was perfect, it had a big screen, fluid and responsive. It would be perfect for my note taking as a student. It was light, and had a secure rubbery back. Wonderful! But then......  (Insert dramatic Phantom of the Opera piano playing. Horrified gasps! Scream! Get the smelling salts! Faint! Oh no!) Well, here is where my review gets useful, hopefully. My mom suggested that I reconsider the iPad mini. She felt it was the best size for me to be transporting to my classes.  First of all, I bought it direct from Apple with engraving. When we purchased it right before Christmas, Apple seemed to have the lowest price at $329 for the most basic model. I got a white, 16gb iPad mini. I also bought it with the smart cover, which is overly priced. However,it really is ingenious and it folds into a stand that I use while reading an e-book. I absolutely loved the device at first sight! It is fluid, I love the screen etc...! I know I have no experience on Retina anything, but the screen really is pretty good!(but you might notice some pixilation on white screens or when you're reading, but it really doesn't bother me.) I really like reading on it on the NOOK reader/app.(I know some of you like the Kindle. I just got the NOOK app because for Christmas I recieved a $25 Barns&Noble gift card.)Over all, I absolutely love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love it!!!!!!! I am sorry if this did not help you at all.I see you going "wack-o"! Don't deny it.[Mother's note: The screen is large enough to comfortably view/edit photos and videos. The screen is the size of a paper back book page. The photo quality is better than expected. It feels and looks like a high quality product. Our elderly,yet hip, neighbor is so impressed, she's going to buy one instead of getting a laptop. If you have an iPhone you will easily know how to opperate this device. My daughter uses my iTunes account so I easily keep track of her purchases. I get an immediate e-mail notice.]
!###I really love this mini iPad. I don't have any other tablets so maybe they would all seen just as fun but it is so speedy, easy to use. I do have a mac book pro so the OS is familiar to me.                    My mother is going to love this! I got in for mothers day, came right on time and I'm super happy with the ipad mini.                    Love my ipad mini! It is the perfect portable size! Product works great and is just as described! Way better than the kindle!                    nice, I like it very much! Lack of earphones, not perfect. Maybe, next time, earphone and ipad can be sold together.                    I love the Ipad mini! I am not technologically advanced at all, but this has already won my heart! I never wanted anything apple until after grad school, just as a reward for hard work. Luckily, A few peers and I are studying abroad and the professors recommended this product or a kindle. Thus, my apple award came sooner than I would have thought. ENJOY!                    For the supplier, the delivery was fast and great quality. And the product: I just love my IPAD, the older models are way too big, but this one is easy to carry in college, at work, etc. I would recommend anyone to buy apple products.                    Item received in good condition.  Working without any problems.  I've used the Ipad for years and wished to try out the Ipad Mini.  Now I have one and I love it.                    I really like how compact it is. would recommend to others who are looknig for a compact version of the ipad                    I like the size and the fact that it is an apple product.  Easy to carry and manage.  Best Buy!!!                    I am a big apple fan, iphone, appleTV and now the ipad mini is perfect size!  I gave my daughter my Samsung Galaxy and she bout me this one...Love it!
!###The packaging was fantastic. No damages. The iPad itself is a super iOS device apple to have released. Delivery time was excellent.I will recommend all business workers and presenters to go for it, as it is light and fits very well on your palm.                    Received this as a Christmas present. At first I was a little weary because I thought that the iPad Mini would pale in comparison due to the retina display. How do I feel about the iPad Mini? Let's just say I never come on here to write reviews, and I couldn't resist reviewing this product.It is absolutely fantastic. The size is PERFECT. I wouldn't want the larger retina iPad, this is so portable and easy to carry around-it's as light as a feather. It is super fast, super easy to set up (you literally turn it on, Apple walks you through an extremely brief, simple set up, and are ready to go) and then are free to use it for whatever your purpose. I let some of my family play around with it and they each had their own preferences! Some liked to take pictures, others liked to watch YouTube videos in gorgeous HD, and others liked downloading games. I may never play a game on my iPhone again--the screen on this is stunning.Apps open almost instantly, and there is never a lag. I highly recommend this product to anyone. Forget Android tablets, go with Apple. You won't be disappointed.                    The only Apple product I own is an iPhone 4 but I've been using iPhones for almost 5 years & love it still.I liked the idea of the iPad at first but tried a few friends iPads out and really didn't see a need for a huge version of my iPhone ....and that's what it felt like,, well actually, more like a HEAVIER, BULKIER, and WAY MORE expensive version of my iphone....so I passed and didn't think more of it,It became super popular of course ,,,,but I didn't really want it much. My IPhone was enough.A few more years, along with a few more iPad versions go buy & THEN......there was the mini!!!I was intreguied and found this new version something I possibly see myself enjoying. I loved my iPhone and had lots of apps that kept me from ever being bored but every once in awhile I wished the screen was bigger....like when drawing in an art app and such....Unfortunately the iPad was only one BIG size and more than I needed or wanted.The mini was perfect!! Just a little bigger than my iPhone making most apps the perfect size to see great & enjoy playing or working more but still small enough to comfortably take anywhere. OHHH and the WEIGHT!!! SOOOOOO much lighter than iPad. Plus I've been playing with it for awhile now and love everything about it.I got the White 64gb Wifi only iPad Mini and now I need a stylus. Anyone know which is good?My first & only iPad and I'm extremely happy. I just wish I could control my app buying/testing since I'm using a lot of space and there is no larger storage than the 64mb but I'm so thankful I got this size! LoL                    I was reluctant to get one at first. I already had an iPad 2 (2nd generation) and the specks didn't seem all that great compared to the newer iPads. However, I like the idea of the size because I love playing games and reading books on mine. So I got one and it did not disappoint. I'm really glad I got the smaller one. It's so light. It feels just a little heavier than my iPhone 4. I can read for a long time with it in my hands without getting tired. I can play games and the graphics are stunning. The battery is really good. I can still use the iPad for an hour or more even when it's at 15%. I use it all day without needing a recharge. What I liked about my larger iPad is that it was like a laptop. I could write my screenplays on it. The keypad on the mini is of course smaller, which makes it hard to type on. However, with the dictation feature I haven't been writing a whole lot. I really love that feature and comes in handy if you don't want to type on such a small device. I also use a wireless keyboard. Lastly, there isn't a lot of space on the sides of the device to hold it without touching the screen. It's still very light so I can grip the device in one hand which I like better.Basically the iPad mini has all the features of a regular iPad. It's a matter of what size you want to get. If you like reading, playing games and want something lighter then this is the perfect fit for you.                    THE APPLE IPAD MINI IS ANOTHER AWESOME PRODUCT FROM APPLE. I LOVE THE FACETIME FEATURE AND SIRI. MUCH BETTER THAN THE KINDLE FIRE.                    I purchased it for as a gift for my little cousin and he hasn't put it down yet. It's fast and easy to use.                    Love the size and everything. Its comfortable to handle! Happy costumer here! Want to take it everywhere i go! Addicted!                    This is my first official Apple product (I have had iPods in the past, but I don't count those)and I *love* it. I had a few hiccups setting it up (mostly around downloading songs to my device through iCloud & iMatch- I blame the apps- and around updating my NY Times e-reader subscription to a tablet one) but I think that is mostly on me for being new to OS and for being REALLY impatient when it came to using my new mini.But, it is day 2 and I am happy as a clam.1. This device is very light, very mobile and really aesthetically pleasing. It fits easily in my purse and is literally the opposite of clunky. Even with my festive patterned case.2. The battery life is impressive. I have been listening to music all day (and playing with new apps while at work) and I didn't need to plug it in until the end of the day.3. The screen is bright & crisp, it isn't a retina screen (really nothing is) and going from other devices to this is different an upgrade.4. The interface is beautiful and is mostly intuitive.5. The experience is just so pretty . I *almost* opted for an iPhone over the Samsung Galaxy Note because I was so impressed with my mini.I haven't really found any cons with the device yet, I will keep y'all updated. . . . . . it did take FOREVER to add some of my songs to iMatch and then to download them to my device (only to delete the ones that weren't checked). That process was a bit painful- I almost returned this for a 16 gb with cellular but it is all good now.And I purchased this at the Apple Store. It was cheaper, but this model was a little hard to come by. They were out of it at one store and I had to go to another store the following day. I think that the black is popular and I think that 32 gb is the sweet spot.
!###It's from Apple, but still, it's sweet.I bought mine for my wife, but I love it just as much.                    I have two grown sons.  I bought one mini ipad for one son, and purchased the great case for it too, but couldn't find another one near Christmas for the other son.  I was getting a bit concerned.  I had to click on this product a couple times to get the right one, BUT it was SO WORTH IT.  I received it prompty, and was so happy to have been able to present both sons with the product.  They love this.                    It was the best computer tablet I ever had because I am starting to like it a lot even apple.                    Can't believe I paid this much for a mini when they are now $299. But, I wanted it when it was new, hot, and sold out everywhere. I paid, they delivered quickly.                    I bought this for my wife who always wanted to use my IPad3.  This has been a great addition and meets the needs for her and the apps that she uses.  In the evening I can now use my IPad.                    Bought it to my kids ,very usable , easy to use - GREAT ,function and real fun.apple are doing it again...                    I recently tried for an extended time a iPAD mini. The design is wonderful. I have used several tablets and smartphones. My dream is to have an Android OS on a ipad Mini industrial design. It is lightweight and a pleasure to hold on.* Good - 7.9&#8209;inch (diagonal) LED-backlit Multi&#8209;Touchdisplay with IPS technology* Bad - 1024-by-768 resolution at 163 pixels per inch (ppi) NEED retina display! Apple, introduce it in next version* Good -  Fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating* Bad - GPS only on Cellular models* Bad - Nano SIMS are non standard* Good - Apps are great look and feel - The NAVIGON apps works only cellular* Good - itunes University is great* Bad - itunes interface is not that god still, confusing* Good - Physical design is unbeatable* Good - Kids will love them, lot of buttery smooth apps* Bad - No back button, So used to them in Android it is just great* Bad - physical button* Good - Lightweight!                    Happy with my IPad  with the multiples of uses it provides worth every penny I spent on my tax refund                    Love this device. The screen is so clear and so much bigger than my iPhone! Really easy to use. Can't live without it.                    I've used iOS devices for several years, and the Mini is by far the best. Better, IMO than the full sized iPad. More useful and more flexible. And unlike Android tablets, iOS devices work brilliantly for music processing apps, like guitar amps and synth apps.
!###I was about to buy a Nexus 7, but I really didn't like the screen. I tried some other android tablets about this size but none of them have the quality the iPad mini has. I think its worth to pay a bit more for a more decent screen, as I planned to use it to read and view graphic content like Pinterest, Dribbble, Photojournalism, etc.I really like how much the battery last, It's great that I can have it 2 or 3 days without charging, while I've to charge my mobile phone everyday.The downside is that in Android you've a lot more of free apps. Most of the free apps in iOS have items inside you've to pay to unlock. You may think that's because there are great quality apps, but some of them are just not so great apps insisting on sell you stuff.Finally, I really miss Swype from mi Android phone. It's still a pain for me to write on the ipad, and I see it difficult to get used to it anytime.                    I absolutely love my iPad mini. The ease and convenience of using it, along with the variety of thing that it can do have made it a real joy to own.                    The product arrived on the day the shipping promised it will arrived. The iPad worked amazing and now I can download programs to it. Everything about the iPad is wonderful. I have already refer this product to my friends and which seller to buy from. Thanks for sending the product on time and with best quality.                    they arived in time in APO adress-Afghanistan its nice to buy used  when they are in good care,without problems,working perfect,recived as described,good taken care from the owner,im really satisfied with the purchase,seller is perfect,5 of 5,keep doing good job,thx again                    I got this for my birthday. My hubby also brought the latest gen.larger iPad for comparison.This one makes much much better photos! It's also faster, lighter and easier to use.I've used it for 3 months and this is the best tech present i ever got! I also got the iPhone 5 but I like to use this more because of the better view.If you're hesitating about getting it, don't. It's really the best iPad/ tablet/ kindle you'll find.                    Yes! I know I paid too much for this device but I had over $250 in gift cards at Amazon and this is what I had been wanting so there you have it. Runs fast and efficiently, good for my games and basically does exactly what I expected. Happy me!                    It's everything everyone said it was - I love it and wonder why I waited so long to purchase it.  Goes everywhere with me. Love reading on it.                    I'm so happy with my iPad Mini!!!  I've already found so many great uses for it and am excited to take it on vacation with us!  I read reviews about the WiFi version not necessarily connecting to the internet very consistently, but I have found quite the opposite!The display is more than I expected, the apps availability is fantastic and the size is perfect!  My iPhone is too small to be useful for anything more than sporadic searches, but the Mini is great!  I can search just like I would on my laptop, but in a much more convenient way, i.e. I don't have to lug around my laptop and I don't need a lot of space!                    Ipad is an Apple product, then dispenses compliments as it is beautiful and works well. I am very pleased with it. The 3G works perfectly in Brazil without unlocking.                    I bought this for my wife and she is on it all the time so I assume she like it a lot lol. She tells me it works great. You might want to buy a case and some screen protectors with it. Looks way better with a case too.
!###FYI-Buyer beware Apple products SUCK and I would not accept one as a gift. Ipad FROZE when connected to itunes (Apple software) after selecting check for update. So called genius says in order to unfreeze I have to restore it to factory settings and loose every single photo, video and app. All because Apple infected it with an update. Can't wait for my Droid mini to arrive...to hell with Rotten APPLE.                    L2D2 takes upto 40% off the price if you return the product.  They expect you to try the product without removing the shrink wrap. How do they expect one to see the screen (which it turns out that the ipad mini has a vastly inferior screen to an ipad which i own) with the plastic wrap on.Even Apple allows you to play with the ipad mini for 14 days to decide on whether you want to keep it.L2D2 was prompt in replying but all they said was their return policy was clearly stated. If you call not being stated on the first screen of the product info as clear then their intention is also as clearAlso just go to their website and enjoy the 5 pages of return policies.  5pages i kid you notL2D2 thinks customer service is not important obviously.  A shame.                                  By&nbsp;Jean Larsen (PORT SAINT LUCIE, FL, US)  - See all my reviews                    Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)                    This review is from: Apple iPad mini MD530LL/A (64GB, Wi-Fi, Black) (Personal Computers)      I had to return the Ipad because when I called Apple tech support to resolve an issue, it turned out that they had had this serial number registered since February.  I paid for a new product and a new price ... and they sent me a previously used Ipad.  The good news is that Amazon Customer service resolved it right away.  Beware the Ipad Shop.                    I had to return the Ipad because when I called Apple tech support to resolve an issue, it turned out that they had had this serial number registered since February.  I paid for a new product and a new price ... and they sent me a previously used Ipad.  The good news is that Amazon Customer service resolved it right away.  Beware the Ipad Shop.                    I bought the IPAD for my daughter, who resides in Minneapolis, however, she did not like the IPAD and sent it back to me, According to my daughter, the IPAD did not contain the features she wanted, I do not know anything about IPADs so I would not know what features she likes, however, I tried to return it for something different, but was told that I can not return it because it was opened, so I told the amazon.com credit card company that I was not going to pay for something that I could not use and because it was opened.  You cannot tell if you can used something unless you try it out, you certainly cannot tell by looking at the item, also, there should be a tag on the item stating that once opened you can not return it, had that been the case I would not have purchased the item, also, had there been a return item tag stating "once this Item is open it cannot be returned" prior to putting the item in the cart I would not have purchased the item.  One should not have to search for the Return Button to determine the condition for returns, because when I buy I do not expect to return.  One thing for sure if cannot return this item I any by business associates will never purchase anything from Amazon again.  SUGGESTION: RETURN POLICY SHOULD BE POSTED NEXT TO THE ITEM or AT TIME OF CHECK, A customer should not have to go Click on the RETURN BUTTON to find out the return policy                    The &#34;refurbished&#34; IPAD miini came to me in a dusty old box.  The ipad mini was obviously dropped and had a chip.  I couldn't believe any was refurbished.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.                    Didn't receive the iPad Miini... Enjoy the 400 bucks jerk. And no tracking information was given with no responding to questions                    The ipads have not shown up but the the credit card has been charged  How do you contact someone live!!!!
!###I purchased this item for my wife and she loves it!  She has learned more using this ipad than if she was using our decktop pc.                    I have an Ipad, and i loved the new size offered by the ipad mini. It fits into any purse... it's just great! and it's just a tiny bit larger than other tablets... I love it.                    It's what I hoped it would be - a replacement for my original iPad 2. It's more portable, easier to hold, lighter than the original. It does everything the larger one does. It's larger than a 7&#34; android tablet. It fits my needs perfectly. And oh yes, it has Sari too!                    Just the perfect size in your hands bought it for my wife on mothers day liked it so much im going to have to buy one for myself                    That is a beautiful graduation gift for my daughter. She likes it very much and read a book on the first day she got it. Thanks very much                    The service of seller was good, fast shipping and nice attitude.But the charger and cable was not orginal and not working after a couple of days. I contacted the seller, he promised to send another charger, but nothing happened later.I have to buy an apple cable myself, which costed me $20 more. Anyway, the ipad mini itself is good.                    Having fought the urge to get an ipad for years due to it's price tag, I am thrilled at the mini's price. I love the smaller size verses the bigger ipads. I use this for college and play. It goes everywhere with me. The only drawback I have with the mini is it is limited in it's storage at 16 GB.                    I purchase this IPad mini in order to use it for traveling.  I have the IPad Retina but is to big for carrying in my purse.  It will do everything the bigger IPad will do but the picture is much better on the IPad Retina.  Having a few problems with the wifi staying up and had to call Apple on it.  That still hasn't totally been resolved.  But I will say the Apple people are very easy to work with.  Its sad to say but the price on the Mini was pretty near what I paid for the 10&#34; Ipad.  All in all I am very satisfied with it and just crossing my fingers that it will work in Europe when I really need it too.                    through the years i have owned various iPods. this is my first Apple product with computer like elements. i live in the mountains where my 3G smart phone has issues with coverage (a 1 foot area in my house that allows me an ok phone call) and wasnt sure if the 4G  and wifi on the iPad would work any better, it doesnt work better in fact it is worse. i try to face time with my grandson and it stops and restarts constantly. right now i'm chalking it up to my inexperience with Apple and will caontact Apple and Verizon for help! immediately. (i even tried it outside the area and had even worse luck)if you are a city person, with towers all around you- go for it!! the screen is amazingly clear. if you're a mountain person and want to use it for internet access, maps etc. - really think about it!                    I am greatly happy and satisfied to receive the item in well packed condition. It is delivered early from its schedule. The item is exactly the same 16GB Wi-Fi+3G Sprint as I ordered. It is operating very well. Your service is very much satisfactory. Thank you.
!###I really like the new iPad mini, it's an amazing product. It's small, light and you can do whatever you want it!                    Apple speaks for itself. The only thing I wish I would have done different is to purchase the one with internet. Great product!                    great product! wish it could do multiple tasks at one time. other than that i'm addicted to my ipad mini!                    What I love is it is so light and compact I can bring it with me everywhere.  I just love being able to find an answer immediately to any question that comes to mind.                    It's a great item, it's better than I hope. very easy to use and be portable. I love it very much.                    Our son just graduated college and needed a new iPad for his job.  He chose this one and was not disappointed when we presented it to him for graduation.                    The iPad Mini is great! My kids, 2 and 4, love the games and features of it! Keeps them entertained on drives and rainy days! Also good for on the go where Wifi is provided!                    I love the thing, it's much easier to handle and is much faster than my iPad 1. Got this at a deal $252 shipped new so I'm ecstatic.                    The mini was just as described.... New. My son loves it.  The seller promised an arrival date & it was delivered on time.Thanks alot, I now have one happy young man                    Very happy with this transaction.  Arrived earlier than expected.  The mini is perfect, especially for this petite woman.  I can comfortably hold it one hand for long periods of time while swiping with the other.  Don't feel I'm losing much with the smaller screen compared to iPad.
!###with not expecting much from this device i was pleasantly surprised how handy it feels and functions and this i feel is the right size for a tablet. i do own a Samsung galaxy note  2 (10.1) and though i absolutely love it  and would always be my first preference.Primarily i bought this for my son who i didn't want to mess up my galaxy note 2this i feel is more handier when it comes to traveling as it very light and display aint that bad as most would want you to believe, it has rich display and all the features of a traditional ipad and has one of the faster Bluetooth connections.Only gripe is unlike android where you can kill process to free up space in this there are no apps to do that for u but you have to press the home button continuously till you see your apps as a row on the bottom and touch each of them till they wiggle with a minus sign on them click them one by one to close em.those who travel a lot and want all the features of an i pad in compact ( the screen is wide enough the borders are thinner) this is smart design, i would suggest buying this instead of the bulkier(in size) ipads or other brand tablets.If you are a girl this would easily fit in your handbag or even a medium sized purse.I bought the black 32gb wi fi only version (dont ever buy the 16 gb one) since there is no option to increase the storage capacity by inserting a higher capacity memory card go for the medium one as the bare minimum as space quickly will run out if you store digital movies videos mp3s pictures and download apps, 32 gb gives you enough space to have spare  space left over( in my case i have 10 movies, 15 music videos, 120 mp3 songs and around 20 apps and im using only 33% of space.its delicate so strongly suggest a cover that covers the corners as well the cover i bought was sold by bear motion genuine leather.                    Ok, I'm a fan.  I waited until the Mini 2 was released before I bought it.  Just got the simplest, 16 GB wi-fi only version, and as a Mac head since 1998, why wouldn't I love this?Still have to learn about the whole Cloud thing; but yeah, very cool gadget to have.                    I had the full sized ipad and when the mini came out my husband bought it for me.  It's size is much more portable.  I can throw it in my purse. It's lighter which makes it easier to hold with arthritic hands.                    With all the ultra skinny notebook computers, the size of a full sized iPad isn't as portable as it was 4 years ago, but this mini iPad is the perfect size!  As a big reader, the iPad mini is the best option... You have access to the nook, kindle, and googlebook libraries as well as the huge iBook catalog.  No retina display, but not a big deal unless you are doing a lot with pics or intensive graphics games.                    Loved mine so much I bought my mother a Wifi only version. She loves it and uses it more than either of us expected.                    What more can be said about Apple - I'm not an &#34;Apple Snob&#34; but have to say that their small devices - iPod, iPhone, iPad - cannot be beat.  Navigating, app library, organizing - much easier for me on an Apple product than an Android and I've used both.  That being said - there are others who are committed Android users and I'd recommend reading their reviews of those products before deciding. Bon chance!                    The merchandise was brand new. I love it. Apple is a very good product. The only thing is that it comes with no fdirections                    Would be a very useful note to this product: Wi-Fi model have no gps module.Anyway it is excellent thing :)
!###Good Production, I like it very much!Thank you!Sellor provided a good speed and good customor service to me.                    I've always liked Apple products and this one is great! I like that it is smaller then the iPad 2 and yet not so small that I can't see things on the web and I read in bed or play games at night when I can't sleep.  Great for people who need to be in bed because of illness. However, I find it sometimes hard to see the header menus. You can't seem to change the font size on those. The other thing I think needs improvement is the thing is hard to hang on to. When I am reading with my thumbs gripping the sides, the screen is touched and the page I was reading turns to the next page.  A case is a must!                    It has all the features I expected and more.  I particularly like the size of the memory 64GB,  they only drawback for me is that the apps which use the keyboard feature covers what you are typing and it is difficult in instant chat situations when the autowrite feature can change your wording without you being able to correct it.  Otherwise, the product is fabuluous!                    this ipad is an excellent choice in representing the new technology in the market technological tables and hand the price is unbeatable.                    It's a nice item.  We seem to be able to replace our other brand readers and tablet with no issues at all.  I'm sure it would be a great buy for many others.                    I can't say enough. The ipad mini is just awesome. Size is perfect for work and/or gaming. Just get one.!!!                    As a former Kindle owner, I prefer the iPad whereas my husband has stuck with his Kindle.  We are an Apple household (having multiple Apple computers, iPads, and iPhones) so loving this device was no surprise. It is intuitive and user friendly with tons of great apps available.  I love the ease and convenience of carrying my books so easily everywhere I go.  Another win for Apple.  I like the fact the mini is compact as Iw ant something small to carry when I am out and about.  It weighs next to nothing and is intuitive enough for a novice to pick it up with ease!                    I like the more compact size compared to the regular-sized ipad. For me there s more than ample screen size to view movies on-the-go and to read books and news magazines                    The mini is great! I love that Siri can speak text from my iBook and the foreflight app is great for flying! For pilots, I prefer the mini over regular sized iPad since the mini is the same size of my regular kneeboard. The color reverse feature is awesome for night flying too, I could see my charts without a flashlight and without a blinding light! Also the charge lasts a long time but I always bring a car charger and plug it in while flying just to be safe. I highly recommend this product!!                    brand beautiful new iPad mini.I love iPad mini very very much.Shpping was very good packing and very fast.
!###I bought the original Kindle Fire when it was first released. I was so excited to get it, I pre-ordered in advance so I could have release day delivery. And for the next several months, I loved it. The screen was beautiful. However I had a few scares with it.The first issue I had with the Kindle was on a few occasions, it just didn't turn on. After discovering how to do a hard-reset, I was able to get it back up and running, and just did this whenever it wouldn't turn on again. Then one day while I was playing music on it via the iHeartRadio application, it started to overheat (wasn't aware that the Kindle even could overheat) and after the music that was playing started skipping, it froze up. I picked it up and found the back near the battery hot to the touch. It would not turn off, so I did a hard reset (as suggested by Amazon). After that, it never turned back on. Thankfully, Amazon quickly replaced my Kindle Fire (for free) and when I received my new one, everything was back to normal. However by this time, I had gotten my first iPhone (4s). I was surprised how much faster the internet browser and applications ran on my small phone, compared to the Kindle Fire. So I ended up using my iPhone more often than my Kindle.On month after Amazon replaced my 1st generation Kindle Fire, they released the new line of Kindles. I almost ordered one of the new HD ones, but decided to wait and see how the reviews compared to this iPad mini, which was released around the same time.Now months later, I'm hearing reports from people who did order the new Kindle Fire HD that they too are running into problems here and there with this new version. After doing a lot of research, I discovered that statistically, Apple products have fewer claims for warranty work than other brands. I'm by no means an Apple-Fangirl, and prefer to use Windows PC's in my own home. But I hate having my brand new items break down, even if they are covered by a warranty. When I spend hundreds on something, I just want it to work, and would rather never need to know how how good a warranty is or not. So the statistics of the Apple products having better reliability was the deciding factor.When comparing the Kindle Fire to the iPad mini, I will say that Kindle (especially the new ones) have a more vivid screen. The Kindle screens are beautiful and the colors are amazing. However that's where the majority of the advantages over the Mini ended for me. The iPad mini has nice web browser, the applications work well (less crashing issues), the wireless connection is fast and I didn't have any sort of lag between turning on my Mini and getting online, like I often did with my Kindle. The mini has been everything I hoped it would be, and I love the size.The iPad mini is super thin. So thin, I actually worry at times it's too slim. It's such a nice piece of hardware, I tend to worry that the ultra slim design might make it too delicate. Thankfully, they make cases like the OtterBox Defender Series Hybrid Case for iPad Mini for people like myself who want to put the delicate Mini into a super duty case. I'm glad I did, since it's taken a tumble or two in the last month I've owned it, and inside the case it stays unharmed.I do love the small size of the Mini. I needed something smaller than the large iPad, but also needed something larger than my iPhone. Something that would fit into my handbag, but that I could also easily read, check and reply to my email on. The screen is very responsive and the speakers produce nice sound, better than the iPhone's. The Mini is perfect for me, and I'm so glad decided on it. Everything works just as well or better than I had hopped for, and I've passed my Kindle Fire down to my pre-teen daughter, who loves it.                    Talk about Apple products is to talk about excellence, innovation, design, simplicity, utility. It's a very nice portable device you must have.                    small, light and good-looking,also very useful!White is much better.I use it to read books and surf internet, and also play games.                    I bought it as gift for my son and he loves it. Its very nice .  WE would recommend to anyone                    After owning a iPad original I decided to finally upgrade.  I never liked the larger 10.1" platform, just to big and like many NOT one hand friendly, that has changed, oh yes!  After playing with one before buying me and girlfriend decided this is it! We bought 2 and a Apple TV. Best combination ever, really! It's bigger than the basic 7" tablets floating around.  The build quality is second to none, especially the android tablets.  Performance is great! If on the fence, get off it and click buy now, seriously, it's all that and a bag of chips.  I have not taken laptop out since my original sync, no need, their is about a app for everything, of course the best Apps cost money, but software cost on computers as well.  Great product worthy of your hard earned money, will change your lunch break forever.                    Perfect size for my needs.  Light, small, yet big enough to amuse one for hours.  It would have been nice if they could have updated the prossesor to be more like the new iPad 3's.  I guess Apple still had plenty of the iPad 2 processors lying around and said, &#34;Oh, we need more money.&#34;  The iPad Mini 2 will probably be a 5 star machine.                    Pretty much the iPad mini is just a bigger version of the iPhone 5 or itouuch. Having both of these devices, I still got the iPad mini and it arrived yesterday. It was a gift from my fianc&eacute; with a free engraving on the back. To my surprise I was not bored. The full screen keyboard makes it easy for me to type and access websites with ease. Way easier and smoother than my other apple devices. Having Siri is a great plus. I was surprised that this feature was included because of the price. Siri understands pretty much everything I say and makes things a lot quicker. If there is a fact that I don't know, she supplies the information within seconds or opens up safari or various apps that can help.All in all I think this a great buy. If you already have the ipad 2 i see no reason to get this though. Don't bother buying that expensive Smart Cover case from apple, there are tons of them on here that are more reasonably priced.                    The size of this iPad mini is just perfect... I don't miss the retina stuff, wich I think got to be great, but I never had anything that has a retina display. Write in this device has now sense. The best feature is the size.                    I received an ipad mini as a gift.  I'm partial to apple products but the price prevents me from buying as many apples as I would like.  This was my first tablet so there was not much to compare from.  To me it feels like a mini MacBook: familiar platform and nuances.  Aesthetics, clarity, user friendliness, and all that apple goodness.  Most of my laptops, desktops, and phones stop functioning after a few years.  I've yet to have an apple device break on me.  Fact is you have to pay more for quality and reliability, lesson learned.  I love listening to music on my ipad mini, the sound quality is outstanding.  Easy access features and sufficient screen size.  Absolutely relish utilizing my mini everyday.                    love itttt best tablet for the price fersure! I would suggest that anyone who wants a tablet that acceptably works to get an ipad.
!###I like it but was just wondering about how long it stays charged.  I thought the time was 12 hours but was just not sure.                    The iPad Mini is the best thing since sliced bread!  I'm learning that it does everything but scrub the floor!  My only disappointment is there are no instructions.  I'm aware that  mfg. don't include instructions anymore but it 's a really frustrating way to learn when you've never even held an iPAd in your hand before!  I'm sure I'll master it in time but it's not the easiest way to learn.  It would be so much more helpful if it had instructions.  Wouldn't a positive experience be better than a negative one?                    I am very happy with my iPad Mini,  Love everything about it especially the compact size, and the clarity of the screen.                    The apple ipad mini has so far surpassed by expectation. The battery life is excellent, it has a 5 mp rear camera that takes great photos. There are a lot of apps which you can get for free and some must have ones that needs to be purchased. The ipad mini is exteremly user friendly, you dont have to be a computer savy person to enjoy this magnificient piece of engineering. It is very portable, with its light weight. It has most of the capabilities as the larger ipads. I recommend this product to anyone who wants even more flexability with movement.                    Bought this as a gift for my granddaughter. Another outstanding apple product. I also own the iPad with retina display.                    bets portable tablet out there and I can sync all contents / synchronize everything with my other Apple devices. Lightweight, portable, and well-built! Couldn't ask for more! And I got it refurbished at a very competitive price.                    It fits in my purse and have it on my desk at work. It's a radio, chat and email device, I check FB all day, and use the Internet if I have to look up something. It only has the Wifi but almost all places have Wifi connection these days, so only in the car I can't use it but why would I need to while driving anyway?The size is perfect, the iPads almost look silly next to mine, like an overkill, and the iPhones seem ridiculously small compared to the Mini. It is the perfect sized Apple product of its kind! Love!                    It's great!! Purchased for wife to use and she loves its size and functionality.  Can also use to occupy grand kids!                    Got this as a gift for my husband. Absolutely loves the item. Highly recommend it! Better and more convinient than a laptop.                    It's fast, light, good battery life. It does everything u want for quick entertainment. Very easy to hold as well.
!###Love it very fast shipping . Perfect for me and have wanted one for a long time. The reg iPad too expensive for me but the mini is perfect to take w me                    I have 3 iPads, 1 Kindle fire, 1 Acer Iconia and 1 Kindle. This is my favorite! Well thought out. Beautiful craftsmanship. Works great with iCloud. Very easy to find accessories (covers, adapters, etc.).                    The IPad is a terrific little device. I'm happy that I received it as a gift. Had I not, I would have purchased it myself.                    Great product, Amazon shipping was fast!!!Mi wife and kid love it !!!We have the Ipad 3 and the good thin about the Ipad Mini is that is so light weight and portable.                    I would recommend this item easy to carry around in most purses/ I haven't used the 4g yet, but I like having it for security when I travel...It's fun to have Siri looking things up and finding quick answers to minor situations..I would definitely recommend this product.                    I have the 3rd generation iPad as well. I bought this because the larger iPad is just too big for my needs. I also have a MacBook, so I rarely used the larger iPad.The mini is just right. It's the perfect size and weight for me. It's kinda like Goldilocks. The iPad mini fits into just the right spot between a laptop and a smartphone. You get everything that the larger iPad has, but in a package that is far more convenient and portable.                    disappointing display, little bit better than iPad2. Rather prefer Nexus 7 or kindle fire. Hope apple will get it a retina display for next generation.                    My first Ipad purchased was a black 32 mg mini.  I bought it at the Apple store because it cost much less than here and my name was engraved free.  I really like this mini. I can put it in my handbag and take it with me without needing a big bag to put it in.  I purchased the leather case sold on amazon to go with it as the magnetic case from apple is not much good.  Pretty useless actually.I am glad I waited on this mini as downloads and playing games going to FB or wherever is so easy.  I gave this a five because I really like this product.Update:OK, so I dropped it on the floor.  I go to apple care and they say it is under warranty but I really didn't buy that at all. And I was right.  Here are the steps for repair.  You try and navigate the apple care site, get a repair id, take the ipad to UPS Store and they wrap it and send it overnight to Apple.  Apple gets it and says, oh it is damaged with a cracked screen and you must pay $241.77 for us to repair.  I say ok.  I go online and pay the $241.77 to repair the glass.  They send another email a couple days later and say we didn't hear from you so we shipped it back unrepaired.  I call apple care.  They say, we see the emails and the payment we don't know what happened but let me connect you to a supervisor who can suggest a couple things.  After being on the phone 20 minutes with them they have the dude call me back and he says, I don't think I can intercept the ipad but if you will send it back we will repair it.  I said look, I already had to drive 10 miles to a UPS store and paid $241.77 only to be told it was returned unrepaired. There was no solution offered to me only that I could call this manager back.  I said for what.  You had your chance and I am disgruntled with apple and expected a whole lot more from Apple.  The moral to this story is forget their repair center.  IT STINKS!  I understand my town has a company that repairs for the same amount with a two hour wait.  That would have been a lot easier.                    After playing around with it for a few days the only word that comes to mind is perfect. Great product.                    I have been a loyal customer of Apple since the Original Iphone was introduced .. I have made several purchasesof Apple Products that I was not sure if I ever need them.. I guess same applies to this Ipad mini .. I havethe original Ipad , Ipad 2 , Ipad 3 .. I did not jump in on the Ipad mini as soon as it was introduced , howevertook my time to consider .. I was getting a little bit bored by the Ipad 3 since it was difficult to use in bed ,space was too cramped on the meal table in Economy class on flights .. and I guessed I had space in my usage fora smaller slate ..Thought about buying the Kindle Fire , Samsung Tab 2 and several other Androids .. but Android just does not cutit for me .. one of the main problems with Android is that if you travel a lot , and you're on an IP thatis not originating from the States , all of the Media and a lot of Apps do not work , does not not matter if your accountand your main household is in the USA .Was seriously considering Windows 8 , however I recently upgraded to Windows 8 on my desktop and was hugely frustrated ..Saw it in an apple store , and liked its Ergonomics .. and a major point in favor of Ipad offcourse is the iCloud ,Music Match , simple backup and restore .. , so thought to myself .. what the heck , let us burn a few dollars ..help apple flourish more , maybe it will help them really introduce an innovative product like they did with theoriginal Iphone and the Original Ipad .Received it today .. can't say I am surprised , same apple packing and same product but only smaller ..can't say I am bothered by the processor speed , or screen resolution .. it works all right ..Still Like the size though .. think I will be using it more than the Ipad 3 .
!###This is a perfect version of Kindle fire or a pretty good version of Apple Ipad, the size is just perfect.                    Must pat myself on the back; product was in excellent condition; it arrived in less time than expected, so my anticipation was short lived; item was well packaged to avoid damage thru shipping & handling; item functions as it should. I'm a happy camper.                    I totally love it, even though my children ( 8 , 6 and 4 years old) play games on it all the time and i never get a chance to use it.                    Where was the iPad mini when I was young?!  This tablet is the perfect combination of form and function.  They just cost too much!                    The iPad mini is just perfect! I'm in love with the size and design of Apple's new version of the iPad.I'm in the Marines and when we're deployed, a light pack is a must and we face a lot of down-time. I had the iPad before and when I saw the iPad mini come out I had to give it a shot.I purchased the Apple iPad mini 32GB WIFI + cellular while in Afghanistan and it has been a perfect addition to my pack. It's light weight, I can fit it in my cargo pocket and 32 GB of space is plenty for my favorite TV shows and movies as well as all of my iBooks (20+) and days upon days of music to listen to while on the go.It's capable of everything the iPad was but it fits in one hand comfortably and typing on it is a breeze compared to stretching those thumbs across the screen like on the original iPad. I'd recommend this product to those looking to purchase their first tablet or those with an iPad looking to upgrade.**UPDATE**Cons:1. There isn't a retina version of the iPad mini, it shares the same characteristics of the normal size iPads other than the design and the power connector.2. Apple is likely to come out with an upgraded iPad mini in the Summer with retina so prepare to be behind the power curve as far as tablet technology.                    I looove mi iPad! The transportation time it was good, the condition it is perfect, and its work really well, so i recomended this product                    As I travel a lot, I use my iPad as a single point of work and entertainment. My previous iPad, 1st generation, was simply to heavy for long reading and a bit clumsy to carry around. iPad Mini is just the right size to follow me on my trips! Strongly recommended!                    it's the best tablet ever!! I'm so in love with it, very useful, and easy to handle and use, even my daughter knows how to use it since she's 3 years old!!! it a wonderful tool for many variarity of works...                    It was everything I was looking for. It fit my needs perfectly and I certainly would recommend it to anyone.                    Love It Bought it for my  music while i travel now i can listen to all my favorite music and check out the internet or play a game its Great !!!!
!###I ordered this device and received it promptly but it started having issues with the touch screen. I sent an email to Amazon to the seller about it but have not received any response. The device is useless without the touch screen. It only responds to touch about 1/4 of the time. Can't use the onscreen keyboard as it's pretty hard to use when it doesn't respond to touch. Don't buy Apple products via Amazon/This seller. Go to Apple instead to get working product.                    I brought this to my Wife & she is thoroughly enjoying it. Its easy to handle and lovely. I like it!!                    Great little product, no question. But why in the WORLD would anyone pay over retail (now $100 on AMZN) for the same item you can get from APPLE, with FREE ENGRAVING, for $100 less? Are you people mad at your money? If so, pls send any excess my way. Thanks!                    Okay, I was a huge apple fan for many years.  In spite of their walled garden mentality, I've always felt that Apple was the best money could buy.  However, I've slowly soured on Apple's business model.  The Ipad mini is nothing more than a miniturazed ipad 2.  The interals with exception of the camera arer exactly the same.  So, when one looks at what he/she is paying for it's outdated 2 year old technology.  This device was outdated and obsolete, before it even hit store shelves.  What does this mean for the consumer?  It means that as soon as the new Retina Mini comes out with 2gigs of ram, you will likely need to upgrade.  Let's consider here that apple has a history of forced obsolescence.  This means they can and often do abandon a previous generations product, when the new one comes out.  An example of this can be seen in the Ipad 1.  The first gen Ipad arrived in April of 2010.  In November of 2012, Apple stopped supporting it with the latest ios update, after ios 5.  This means that customers that purchased the 64 gig cellular model for over $850.00 now have an overpriced paperweight...but at least we still have the beautiful logo to admire.  When apple first introduced the Ipad, the company promoted it as a virtual replacement to the laptop and while I never really subscribed to this notion, I do feel as though at nearly a $1000 dollar expense, this should buy me a lot more than a shade over 2 years before the company forces the customer to upgrade, or be left behind.  Now, there will be those that say, "Apple doesn't force you to do anything."  I beg to differ.  Yes, they indeed do.  Outside of music purchases in Itunes, do I as a consumer have the right to use my digitally purchased content on a non apple device?  The answer is no.  So, if I choose not to upgrade my old ipad, my content is locked tight in Itunes and I have no means to access it.  This is the nature of a "walled garden" and I as a consumer understand this.  But when apple supporters buy in to this(at a high price point I might add) we receive no assurances that our purchase has a shelf life of greater than a couple years at best, or 6 months at worst.  See again, those who purchased an ipad 3 only to be surprised by the quick release of the 4.  By the way, Apple no longer manufactures the 3.  So if you have problems with it, you have to pay for the cost of repairs at this point or purchase a 4.  It's just a matter of time before consumers of the Ipad 3 begin to feel the very same pain of those who puchased a first gen Ipad.My biggest issue with the mini?  The price.  Come on apple...The ipad Mini cost by most accounts $112 dollars to make and is sold at a starting price of $329...Give me a break.  As we go up in storage capacity, it will cost us no less than $100 dollars...this is pure lunacy.  I am no fanboy of any brand, but if we look at Google and Amazon's investment in cloud storage, we begin to see how rediculous it is to pay for onboard storage.  Apple's Icloud is nothing more than a sync service; it is not a true cloud based service.  Apple has no insentive to invest in true cloud service because to do so would hurt their bottom line, because they would not be able to charge the consumer for extra storage, as the cloud eliminates this need, for the most part.  The cloud is the biggest threat to Apple's business model and would surely drive profit margins down even further than they are already.  Please understand I am not an apple hater; but I am simply no longer a blind consumer and am informed enough to see that in this case, apple is successfully marketing and selling repackaged crap in a smaller bag...but again, at least we still get the nice apple logo, which of course comforts us and helps us to reaffirm our fabulous purchase of a brand new old idevice.                    I finally got my Mini IPad. I got a great deal from the Amazon Market place. I have the regular size one so I figure let me get the min one as well.I thought for sure I was going to love this little mini IPad. Something to throw in my purse and take out to use at a coffee shop or park when I want to surf the web or answer emails.It turns out I did not like it at all. I have very good vision, but this is not the greatest on the eyes (well my eyes anyhow) I find myself squinting or making the images larger and just not enjoying it as much as I love my regular IPad.It's just too small for me to enjoy it.  The regular IPad is just the right size for me........now that I love!
!###This is a great product. I will recommend it without hesitation to everyone. Try it and you will love it.                    I had no doubt this would be anything other than pure digital greatness! I have a multitude of idevices and i also develop and service all idevices... I was a bit sketchy about ordering a device of sorts through a service like Amazon, but then again Ive come to trust Amazon for quite some time now and I was not disappointed. Great product, great service...                    Steve Jobs once said that 7" screen is too small to do anything productive. I am glad he changed his mind.iPad Mini is a perfect sized tablet for casual users like me who use the device to browse, facebook, do online shopping, check emails, and play games like Temple run. iOS also makes it perfect for my son who gets to learn his ABC and numbers with several apps available in the iTunes store.The Wi-Fi sync feature is my favorite - something that allows me to keep my music in sync without finding cables and connecting to my laptop. iCloud is a perfect service for keeping my photos backed up - especially when my little one learns a new trick and decides to suddenly show it to us :-)                    Am very very please will tell friends to purchase it am very please with my purchase don't have no complain                    I am not an apple guy, but my son loves it. so it is perfect product fo a gift.It is amazing and fast and light.                    Ordered one for my husband for birthday recently and I got one in April and I love the size and its does everything I want.                    Upon receiving my new mini I noticed that the top left corner was slightly damaged.  Small screen chip/crack.  I contacted the seller who passed me off to Apple to correct the problem.  Contacted Apple and they said I'd have to pay for a new screen.  I've decided to just protect it in a case until the screen is unusable instead of reaching into my own pocket again to buy a new screen for a new mini.It's still working well and I do like the item.  Hopefully others take a very close examination upon receiving their apple products.                    I bought this for my wife. I am not a fan of the IPad; however, she says it's ok. We live/work overseas and we use some applications over here. She expected the IPad to do more things such as &#34;Viber&#34; which is an App that is used over here, but that App isn't supported on the IPad. There are a couple other Apps that Anroids have which the IPad doesn't support.                    soo cute,,and fast for shipping!.. great item!..soooo cute i loved the color and size,, not big was  good for travel it is perfect!!..i love it!                    I got a Amazon gift card for mother's day.  I really never shopped on Amazon, so I really did not know what to buy. Even though I already had an iPhone 4, I decided to purchase the iPad Mini on Amazon.  It was at a great price from the Seller.  After I bought it I fell in love with it and I use it all the time.  The difference between my iPhone and iPad Mini is that I can see the words better because it's much bigger on the iPad Mini and I especially loved the Photo Booth icon that comes with it.  I have been having so much fun taking those crazy pictures that I have laughed myself silly.  It's a great, fun gadget to have.  Thanks to my family for the Amazon gift card!
!###I've always purchased and used a PC both at home and at work.I've also prided myself in fixing the many PC problems I've encountered over the years, but certainly didn't appreciate the time and effort I had to spend on PC problems.I recently bought an ipad mini and love it. I wanted it as a quick access to the internet (wifi) and email.  Though I had never used an Apple before, I was really surprised how everything seemed rather intuitive and how quickly I was using it with ease for so many tasks. I have also found that the ipad mini is everything that it is advertised to be - the long battery life, many available apps, easy to use, etc.  I will soon be needing a new PC and am seriously considering a switch to Apple.  A friend of mine got tired to spending so much time just on keeping his PC updated and protected that he decided to switch to Apple 3 years ago and has never looked back.  I may follow in his footsteps as a result of my experience with Apple's ipad mini.                    I've had mine for almost a year of hard use on a daily basis for both work and play. My iPad mini has become an indispensable tool. This is a near perfect and high quality device, built like a tank, sexy design, power easily lasts me all day long in spite of intensive image processing use, excellent display even though it's not retina, extremely functional, I can easily hold and work with it in one hand. If you want a device that works consistently well all the time, then pay the higher price and get an iPad mini - you get what you pay for and it's definitely worth it. The mini has set and maintains the high standard by which other small tablets are measured by. Hold one in your hand, you'll see.                    I had an idea that the iPad Mini would be wonderful but it has exceeded my expectations! It is small, portable, but very powerful. Also, the service from the seller was great! I purchased a refurbished one and it was just as described.                    I absolutely love this tablet! I own many devices in my nerdism and line of work. I have owned an iPad 3, Nexus 7, Chromebook Series 5, all the iPhones, many Android phones by HTC and Samsung and now, my beloved iPad Mini.The thing about the mini is really the size and design. That outweighs everything else for me. It's gorgeous, a pleasure to use, and a pleasure to hold. The bigger iPads, no matter how powerful or brilliant, don't get as much use for me because they are hard to handle. I can never comfortably hold a big iPad for too long without noticing discomfort. Not the the larger iPads aren't wonderful devices, they just end up staying at home for me.The mini goes everywhere with me. It's fast enough to do everything I want it to do. The screen is still great even through non-retina, and I hardly notice the lower resolution at all. It's just a really awesome little device, and should be bought if you are thinking about it. Just buy it, you won't be disappointed.                    The iPad mini is a great tablet and the size is perfect for those of us with small hands (and small handbags) .  I think one of the things I'm  most impressed with is the picture quality.  I'd recommend the iPad mini for anyone considering buying a tablet.                    I never thought I would buy 7 or 8 inch tablet. I'm the owner of iPad 4 and now I recently purchased iPad mini. When I compare two of these devices, iPad 4 definatey little faster but not by large margin. I thought by putting iPad 2 processor chip iPad mini would be lagging but I was wrong.. Apple did update the Internet wifi chip and it has the same network card found in iPad 4. iPad mini is fast when it comes to browsing and watching youtube videos etc. I don't see any big of a difference when I play iPad 4 and mini side by side.. Mini is so light and handy,now I barely use iPad 4. I'm very satisfied with iPad mini.                    Love the ipad mini.  It fits in my purse, it's big enough to do all tasks I do on my computer at home.  Works perfectly like all my apple products.  Much easier to take along than a laptop!                    Coming from an iPad 3 (retina display). Love the Mini's small size but definitelynot the low-resolution display.Got used to the fantastic iPhone 4 and iPad 3 displays, therefore returned the Mini andwaiting for the version with retina display (early 2014?)...                    Let me start by saying my household is Apple products ONLY. There's no need for me to try anything else because I've have other products in the past and they have been ok at times but for the most part just a PITA. Every since the first iPhone came out, I've been impressed and at times in the past, I've tried other phones and none of them held a torch to the iPhone. From computer to Apple TV to iPads, we have them in our house. The ipad mini was our latest addition and upon getting one for my wife I chose to get another for myself. I was using the IPad 2 but I just had to get a "mini" for myself.It's been an awesome lil machine. I like that I can easily put it in my side cargo pants pocket and go. That's a plus. It operates just as any other ipad does to me just has Siri and a lil better picture quality. Yet and still I wouldn't trade any of them.If you want quality, get an IPad, if you just want to freeze up surfing the web or freeze up doing anything, get a Android tablet. I love Apple and their products.                    My husband got me this for Christmas,  It has been great to  keep alot of stuff on that I use to have to do on the computer, Now I just take it with me.
!###Amazing high quality build quality. Just feels SO excellent in your hand.Built to last and amaze with magic.Thin, sleek, light.Perfect screen size. Nice bright, sharp, excellent color screen.Very long battery life.Thousands of apps to amaze you.Extremely highly recommended.                    Realised after I bought it that this was the old ipad and not the new one with retina display. I notified the suppliers who refunded my money immediately and without fuss. Thank you for the excellent service.                    The iPad Mini is a great little device.  Very versatile and allows me to do multiple things that I would normally do on a laptop on a convenient portable device.                    This ipad was in great condition. i use this everyday, i dont see any scratches and works perfectly as if i bought it brand new from the apple store!!                    When I was a kid in the 80's, this would've been awesome on long road trips.  I am thankful for technology advancing as it has - this provided my kids with great entertainment while driving and flying and going on vacations this year.  As for the iPad itself - I'm happy with it.  Easy for little hands to handle and it's just like the regular iPad only a bit smaller.  No issues with it at all!                    This was a product was a great buy and a fantastic product.  First time iPad user and I am very happy that I bought this product.  It deserved a 5 star due to the quality, purchase price, and great product.                    I had read that the screen is not as good as the full size ipad, I cannot tell the difference...                    This is everything I had hoped it would be. I like that there are so many accessories that are available for it.  They enhance the iPad's versatility.  I alsolike the size and the light weight of the iPad.                    I just love the size and function of this I pad mini.  It does everything I need and more. I get my email, facebook,netflix, dishnet tv,.Internet is fast and I love all the apps I use. Also takes very good pictures except when there is very little light.  Oh, and got all my Kindle library on it also.  Very happy with it.  No problem being used when purchased.
!###I have the larger IPad, and have had it for years, So when the wife said she wanted a tablet, I knew what to buy for her.                    My mother learned to use a Windows 7 netbook machine in her 70s. However, the computer got uncomfortably warm and thus was not ideal for using in a sofa. She loves her iPad Mini. I no longer have to worry about viruses, updates rebooting the system, &#34;your computer is too slow&#34; errors on Skype... And a touch interface is certainly a lot more intuitive for people not too familiar with computers.A few of the bad things about this are:-Since it's small, my mother sometimes have to press several times on onscreen buttons until it activates. I guess at least for native apps they could have adjusted the size of the buttons so they remain as easy to press as in a big iPad.-No ability to download music directly to the device to the Music app... Unless you purchase it on iTunes. This is one of the biggest issues preventing iOS devices from being fully independent from computers.-No flash for the back camera-iPhone apps look ugly on it, because they don't display in iPhone 4 resolution, but it iPhone 3GS resolution (pre-retina). This means pixels have to be doubled.An unexpected bonus was:-A fully functional compass. I wish my iPod Touch had one.                    Apple products are usually all the same, but the quality is very good, becomes hot easily after i used it for a while.                    The mini is everything I hoped it would be. The same functionality as my iPad but so much lighter and easier to maneuver and carry, particularly for travel.                    Works as described. No issues encountered so far (1 month) Perfect price. No complaints what so ever. My mother liked it as a gift. Works exactly as your regular IPAD. This item was no fake in comparison to some @ Ebay.                    I love that I can carry it around in my purse on days when I do not feel like lugging a knapsack.                    Everything was just like it said it would be. No complaints....great product.... great price...great service.... loved it.... would buy again from this buyer again                    Perfect. iPad came promptly, new in box, and my fianc&eacute; loves his birthday present even though he opened it a month early. Bum.                    That will hopefully be resolved soon, and that's the ability to use MS Office on this.  Currently using a third party app off the apps store to get minimal support.                    perfect, comes well sealed, I have nothing more to say, anyone who knows Apple products know that you will be 100% satisfied!
!###I've used PCs all my life but apple is better. No viruses don't have to buy a new operating system every two years or so.                    nice and small u need to buy a case to keep it safeit gets scratches easliy so protectperfect for a student nice compact and read to go and use it anywheredefinately recommend                    Got on time. Has good sleek feel to it. My first experience with apple device. Annoying to have to put password in to do most stuff on it. Overall good book. Like my android devices better.                    I chose the mini model because of its size. It's way better and more comfortable than her bigger sister. The only down side is that the screen is not the bet Apple has to offer. Bummer.                    Now need to establish relationship with provider; a challenge since we live in Mexico. Product itself is all that we expected, and the wife is ecstatic.                    I bought this as a gift for my wife and she absolutely loved it! She tried to use the regular iPad but its 10' screen was too big for her purse. The look and feel of it made it to a perfect companion, being small, beautiful and very useful. It was also a success with our kids that would rather play the games on a smaller device that is friendlier than the big 3rd generation iPad they used to borrow from me.                    i like it and i'm enyoing a lot. i like the size. it is more confortable for travel and my family use it                    Love it its amazing most awesomest iPad it works great and feels like a brand new iPad I would recommend buying it to anyone.                    I already own an iPhone, which I have loved (I've had iPhones since 1st generation) and rely on for so much, even though I'm not a big phone caller.For some reason, I just decided I wanted a wifi iPad, mostly for reading books. Well, this is wonderful--download via wifi, but then I've got the book to read when I want. I kept some of my favorite apps that benefit from a larger screen, as well as apps made especially for iPad.Lightweight, easy to hold.                    My wife didn't want it but I got it for her for our anniversary.  She loves it, is watching TV in the kitchen on it, reading books so generally all the other gadgets are sitting in the corner unused.  Best $ I've spend on a gift for her so far and I'd recommend this product to anyone who needs to get something useful that will be used every day.
!###Works beautiful and is everything I thought it would be. Great for reading and playing games when I travel so much for work.                    if I can only figure out how to get the apple id from previous owner off.  I have an ipad 2 got this one because of the smaller size and ease of taking with me.                    I bought this for my vacation, it arrived extremely quickly in just a few days. It works perfectly, all wires ad plugs perfect as well.                    great device! I carry it to everywhere. If you need an ipad and dont want to trouble with carry it all around, ipad mini is a great choice                    The product met all expectations. A nice, usable size for easy use by children as well as adults. I'm very pleased with this product. My little granddaughter was hoping for an iPad Mini for her birthday and she absolutely loves it!                    I love my iPad mini and take it everywhere with me! Screen couldn't be better and it seems very sturdy! I've had it a couple of months now and I have no complaints! I love my Netflix app and also have the Kindle app on here as well to download novels!While I didn't buy my iPad from Amazon (I actually didn't buy it at all, as it was a gift) I did buy a case from here, and will buy more from here because its ridiculous that these cases cost $40 and up...many of them not stylish at all!                    The size of the mini is just short of an inch wider than your typical competitor.  The mini is just wonderfully light and easy to hold                    I don`t know why never like the &#34;mini&#34; models, but this time was a good purchase, good design, is easy to use, the sound and the image quality isgreat, very good camera, small but very good performance...                    ll love this mini !! easy to carry and an amazing camera !I recommend this to anyone traveling or in need of compact computer !                    This is a wonderful tablet! I would recomend it to anyone who can afford it. I like the size. Really.
!###Great product. I got another one for my wife because she liked mine so much!The LTE network is very fast and responsive.                    I am really enjoying my BRAND new iPad Mini! This is my first Apple purchase. So far so good! Great quality in videos and camera use! The only problems that I have had is getting use to the software, but it will take time to get used to.Fast WiFiCrisp TextBright ScreenThin and perfect sizeSmooth sliding to one page to another                    I thought the iPad 2 was pretty sweet but this is sensational. It's the real iPad (in my eyes) - so small and light. Phenominal engineering and wonderful, cheap software.  The iPad Mini is amazing.                    I receivde the package without problem and it works okIs just what I neededThanks for allbest regards                    I especially love my IPad Mini.  It is a good weight as I have trouble holding things and it is convenient whenever I need  it.                    Never turn my laptop on anymore.  Everything pulls up fast, so clear.  I never thought idcenjoybanythingvas much as I do my mini iPad.                    ...you should buy it from Apple. Don't pay the inflated prices from secondary sellers. $400+ for the basic Mini? Hahaha! It retails for $329.
!###True to description. I received very quickly and have been attached ever since. It's small and convenient so it makes a great personal assistant, especially for traveling.                    It is all I spected and it arrived on time. I defenetely would buy another one next time i need it.                    This is the BEST gadget ever.  I use it all the time and still learning some of the features but it is FANTASTIC                    This thing is amazing.  I love how clear the screen is and it fits great in your hand! MUST HAVE                    I love my iPad, and people can buy this from this page, because you get it on time and it doesn't take to long waiting for what you want!                    It's light, multifunctional and camera is fantastic! So convenient to carry and use wherever you go. Use it to go online, watch movies, write messages, you name it.                    I bought this as a gift. as well as the warranty that was extra. not qualified to write a review since I have not use this item but the person I bought it for seems to love it.                    love the ipad but was disappointed  2 weeks later when I took it to an apple store for a crack and they told me I would have to pay for it                    Awesome lightweight, slim and more responsive then my ipad 2. Fits in one hand so that makes it easier to carry.                    Great product. My husband I really enjoy its compact size, battery capacity, speed.  Siri is afun and very useful tool
!###We have one of the larger units and it was always being borrowed. This smaller unit is full of new features.                    Awesome product. Awesome store. Great deal!What else could you ask for? Even better than the previous iPad.Highly recommended.                    .Lovely piece of kit.  Easy to use. Light weight.  Versatile,  The larger screen is easier to navigate the internet than the iPhone or Ipod.  But not as weighty as the ipad.                    Apple's iPad Mini is convenient, reliable, and the perfect size for traveling. Recommended for the techies out there who want Ipad capabilities in a smaller size. .                    Product as described and was shipped extremely fast! My new iPad mini was new in box and is up and running just perfectly! I am a very pleased customer!                    The Apple I-Pad 16 GB Wi-Fi is an excellent item!  However BE AWARE if you are getting it through ALWAYS  INNOVATIONS  I would suggest that you get another supplier to send you your product!  Their policies are terrible!  When I had ordered the IPad I made a mistake and thought I had ordered the 32GB!  When I returned it, they charged me a twenty-five percent re-stocking fee...about $150!  I had opened their box and tried to set up the IPad  when I realized it was not the 32GB but is was the 16GB.I feel this is highway robbery!  It was an honest mistake!  Amazon backed their supplier Always Innovations and not me who has been a very loyal customer for several years!  So, don't look to Amazon for help!  Just be extremely cognizant of Always Innovations!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                    Perfect size and works great for on the go.  Great with a Bluetooth keyboard case.  Easy setup; just turn on, tap settings and connect to WiFi and you're ready!                    I bought it for my son's birthday and finishing all of elementary school with straight A's.  He loves it and it is easy for him to carry with him.
!###Probably the best ipad I've had and I've had the first ipad and the second I really like the ipad mini                    I received my order promptly and the price was a really great deal. They fit my IPad mini perfectly. I will order from them again.                    First off I didn't buy it thru Amazon but thru Apple. I already have an iPad3, but its heavy, hard to hold for long periods. I bought the Mini because of its ultra light weight and perfect form factor especially when traveling/commuting. Everything the iPad 3 did, the Mini does. Now my reason for returning it. Let's face it, the retina screen spoils everyone with the high detail, ultra sharp rendering of everything. The Mini's screen resolution, in my opinion, is terrible. Its pixelated, grainy, fonts are NOT sharp but fuzzy, it seriously gave me a headache. I'm near-sighted so I can see everything sharply close up so its not my eyes. I'm going to wait when an Apple retina Mini comes out in the future.                    I like the product but I'm having a hard time setting up my mail.  It is not easy to get started if you are not computer smart.  My nephew set it up for me all except my mail.  I have had it for a month and still don't have it done.  I have used the videos to do this but it still will not set it up.  I'm going to call support to help me.                    There were a few quirks with the ipad, but maybe it's my wifi at home.  Not sure, but I still like it.                    i just wish the delivery would give option for signature regarding proof of delivery.the product i bought is a gift so I do not have feedback. but I do love my regular Ipad!                    If you're looking for a smaller version of the iPad 2, look no more. Sure the iPad mini doesn't have Retina Display but it makes up for its one-hand capability.                    I love my new ipad, very light and very easy to use. I recommend this product. I sync all my devices now                    I am a big apple fan and I love my new iPad mini. I should have gotten the one with cellular data so I could add it to my phone plan                    Small, compact and powerful. Easy to use. Holds text, pics and video. Screen is bright and clear. Very nice indeed.
!###Arrived on time, works well and has a quite a long battery life once fully charged. My laptop decides to take the day off every once in a while and this little device keeps me from pulling my hair out. Most websites operate the same way that they would on a normal computer and for someone that does not remember to charge her rechargeable electronics, this is great for me because it performs well even when the battery is low. The camera works well which makes the IPad even more convenient because only one device is needed while travelling. The speakers work wonderfully. My music comes out clearly. This is a wonderful device.                    When the iPad mini first came out, I thought it was neither fish nor fowl.  And I must say that the difference in price between the mini and the &#34;full-sized&#34; iPad was a factor.  But I really like the size, and the screen is big enough for the kind of use I'll give it.  And although I bought a keyboard to go with it, I found myself using the on-screen keyboard to take notes at a day long meeting.                    It's your typical Apple product.  Very user friendly and intuitive, great graphics and wonderful product support.  I like the smaller size for reading online content.                    This was a gift for my adult daughters birthday.  I already had an ipad and she liked it so I got her the ipad mini. She loves it. Shipping was prompt.                    Read the previous reviews and decided to try.  I can confirm: 1) received on the earliest day of the anticipated time, 2) shipped same day, 3) condition is really like newThx a million.                    Thank you the I pad is almost like new and thank you for the covers. Also, the price is a great                    There's no doubt about it, apple holds still number one, it's my second mini, and I can't wait until the  next one comes out, WOW good job apple!!! You are still nnumber one!!!!                    The iPad mini is just the right size for my uses. It is small enough for using the touch screen for typing without a sylus, yet large enough to use for reading books. My only negative is the screen may be too small for some websites to view easily. Yet if you are willing to use the zoom mechanism to view part of the website, then this may be the product for you.                    I just rated the iPhone 5s thinking I was rating the iPad mini, because the were purchased together.  Bottom line is they are both excellent product. Easy to use and is more compatible with many more apps than its competitors. This is my second purchase but I find thus size more comfortable and less bulky than the regular size.
!###iPad mini is a great investment.  Price was a little better than in stores, ordering is easy thru Amazon and always very speedy delivery.  The iPad is extremely easy to set up and screen is vivid and easy to manage. Thank you.                    try handing this to a senior citizen. its shortfalls will be very apparent.Good:-Beautiful display-Solid build-Light as can be.Bad:-Interface was designed for a 10&#34; device (see Regular iPad), thus touch targets are hard to hit at times.-the size will be just a pinch too big for most female hands or smaller male hands. the pictures of it being gripped from both sides is a bit misleading for the lower end of the bell-curve of population.i've since sold my device and i'll keep my money handy for the next iteration of the iPad (XL?). This device ended up being delegated to checking email and nothing more since it became a hinderance.Your mileage will vary. others i've spoken to love its size and it will fit into their work-flow much easier. it just didn't fit well into mine.                    The thing is worth it. By far it is the coolest gadget I have ever bought and I would buy it again.                    Portability is a huge plus. Also, I was able to take handwritten notes for Chemistry even with the small size of the mini.  The small size did not diminish the ability to have hand written notes electronically vs real paper.  Tons of apps make the iPad my only choice for a tablet.  Wifi is great!  Great range!                    Okay so I got this as a Christmas present and I fell in love with it the sec I seen it, it fit in my hand perfectly and it is vary lightweight. It is supper fast wish I could of gotten the 3G or 4g on but oh well and it is vary durable I left int in my car when going snowboarding  in  -10 deegres F and when I was done and got back to the car I was afraid it wouldn't work because I had a 3rd gen iPod touch and the scene stopped working because of the cold and yeah then this summer I when down to southern Texas in left it in the car again in 118 degree weather and when I go back that heat warning was on and I waited 15 min and then it worked fine. I have dropped it once or twice from like 3 feet off the ground and nothin has happen but yet 3 feet isn't a lot but I am not just going to drop 10 ft off the ground to see and Siri is amazing they can make her better  by letting her have convstations  with the user but otherwise amazing it is way better than voice control. I would recommend this to anybody who need simple technology. Because me dad is a computer geek and he hates apple product because he said it is technology for dummies haha but yeah I like it a lot so I would say great for teens and young adults.                    I've had the iPad mini since it came out and while I love the form factor of the iPad mini, it is lacking somewhat on the computing power side.  I normally use my iPad while traveling for movies and browsing the internet (travel almost every week for work).  The iPad mini is almost perfect for traveling and browsing the internet but the lack of power really holds it back from getting 5 stars for me.  The iPad mini struggles a bit to play HD movies/shows... I usually use my mini at hotels hooked up via HDMI to the hotel TV so I can watch movies/etc full screen.  I don't have too many issues with playing SD videos but HD videos stutter a lot and are pretty much unwatchable (should be noted that the HD files I used were h264 files in an mkv container and played via an app called Azul).  It would be great if the mini had a retina screen as well because text would be much easier to read.  That being said, I'm still happy with the current gen iPad mini and don't mind the trade off in power and lack of retina for form factor and size.  That being said, if the next gen mini is significantly more powerful and has a retina screen, I know I'm going to be all over it.                    got my mini ipad a day earlier then it stated and it works great would recommend this product and this company to anyone.                    I love my IPad mini. I was a bit nervous about ordering it online after some reviews I read, but mine came in in perfect shape.                    Was what was advertised and shipped in a timely manner.Like the size of the mini vs the full size Ipad.I don't feel color is a big issue, especially if you are putting into a case.                    I got this for my boyfriend for a gift and amazon wrapped it up so nicely and they put my card on their with a bow. My boyfriend is obsessed with it and says the iPad is easy to handle and very light weight.
!###Edit: 2012-11-30 this is better than I expected. Great quality with long distance shots. I'm still working on moving subjects in low light conditions. I do not like the "low light" mode, as the ISO seems to be set real high and the result is grainy. I'm using either manual or program modes. Still the best non-SLR that I've had.I just got this camera and love it. For me, it has all of the advanced features found in much more expensive DSLR cameras, but without the price. The optical zoom is wonderful to have instead of having to worry about carrying around various lenses for larger cameras. It is not a pocket camera, nor would I recommend it for beginners, as there are a lot of features that would not be useful for them. The size of the camera is perfect for me. The flash has to be manually opened up, which I love because I don't have to fiddle around with making sure that the flash icon says what I want it to say...The flash is on or off, that simple.It has all the scene selections that the smaller Canon cameras have, but it has a lot more. There's modes that are mostly found on DSLR cameras on this: P (Program); TV (Shutter Speed Priority); AV (Aperture Priority), Manual, Auto, "LIVE" and a nice collection of fun shooting modes that Canon has. (miniature mode, fisheye, discreet, fireworks, low light, snow etc). There is also a record button on the camera so you don't have to switch the dial to video mode to start recording.There is also an actual lens cap on this camera. I like that because I have had three other small Canon cameras have the auto lens cover break or get stuck and cause all sorts of trouble.If you want a more advanced camera, but don't want the $500+ price tag, I think this is a very good choice.I really do not recommend getting this if it's going to be a beginner camera.I don't ever use auto mode because I have never gotten good results out of it. I like being able to select what mode I want based on the conditions.!###I don't understand the other reviews, really? Are you people serious?!I LOVE this camera, when I first saw it was "to be released" I started getting exited, I need this camera, the zoom was (is) perfect, the price, eh, not outta sight. Finally the day came, It was available to order, I ordered, waiting, patiently for it to arrive in time for our Disneyland vacation. It arrived. I was sceptical, bigger that I was used to, smaller than I expected, would it live up to my 200? ... Then the I took some test shots, garden pics, they looked beautiful!! So we were off to vacation, I took many, many pictures, day, night, motions, stills, portrait, landscapes, flowers, characters, all looked good but only able to see them on the camera. When I got home, I plugged the camera into my 55" HD tv via the hdmi cable, started the slide show.....The moment of truth! Did I get my monies worth? Risking a $4000.00 vacation photo shoot of hundreds of pictures of my kids, the park, capturing the actual "essence" of our grand vacation on a $329.00 camera?I DID!!!Breath-taking 16 mega pixel pictures adorned my 16:9 Full HD 1080p resolution panel (1920 x 1080) TV screen, flawless, gorgeous, vivid colors, absolutely stunning!!I was thrilled, all the photos in 16:9 format.  I couldn't get enough!! I was the most excited of all the family members, "look, you can see so much detail..." I was beaming!! Plus the HD video, It's OUTSTANDING!!!Great camera, for the casual or everyday shutterbug! I love it!!!Oh, and don't believe me?4/5 stars at one site, 4/5 stars at another, and 8/10 at still another.!###I am so frustrated to see the other reviews about this camera.One person is comparing to T3i, this person probably doesn't know how to buy or use a camera because clearly is comparing it to a $900 camera.Another person doesnt know this camera has Auto mode so she keeps taking blurred pictures of h er kids and dogs. She probably needs a cheaper camera for her needs and place it on Auto/Sports mode with FLASH on at all times. Blur-b-gone.That's all I was going to say, this is a fantastic camera with manual controls at Sub $300 range. Of course SX50 is better but also twice as expensive and T4i is much better at $899, but that's over 3 times more money and twice as heavy and no 30x zoom.!###This is a very nice camera if you are looking for a long range point and shoot camera with an excellent quick zoom and primarily will be shooting in daylight. I was looking for something smaller to carry around besides my big DSLR Camera and lenses. So I gave this camera a try and I was surprised at how small it was when I received it. The camera seemed well built and the focusing was very quick!!!! The stabilization worked very well at long distances. My only downfall with this camera was the Iso Noise in pictures in low light. It was very evident when you get around iso 600. Even at iso 400 you could see noise. I expected better low light results from Canon since I'm a Canon fan and I shoot with Canon products. I've had other point and shoot cameras that performed better in low light situations. In contrast, pictures in full daylight with no flash needed were very good!I'm sure the ISO noise issues in low light was due to the fact that this camera used a CCD sensor and not a CMOS sensor. I decided to upgrade to the Canon sx50 model with a CMOS sensor and a 50x zoom. I couldn't be happier!!! The sx50 is an awesome camera and shoots greats pictures even in low light.Pros: Easy to use, excellent focusing system, small size, battery lifeCons: Iso Noise in low light!###This is a great camera for under $300.  It has most of the functions more expensive cameras have but is a lot more affordable.  It takes breathtaking photos and great videos too.  Great zoom and all my pictures come out clear and perfect.  Highly recommended 100%!###I read all the negative reviews before buying and wasn't swayed.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase.  I'm no professional photographer but this is my 6th digital camera so I'm pretty experienced at point and shoot.  I love my canon a3300 but it only has 5x optical zoom.  I've now decided to enhance my bird watching with bird photography and the 5x zoom just didn't get it.I took this SX500 right out of the box and as soon as the battery was charged, I started shooting 30X closeups of bluebirds and woodpeckers through my basement window without any configuration of the camera except programming the date, time, and time zone...Pure Auto...and I was amazed at the quality of photos.  I just wish Amazon would let me upload a couple of them to show.  You don't need to be any kind of expert or even experienced to take simply amazing quality pictures with this camera.!###After reading the poor reviews of this camera, I just have to say they don't know what they are talking about.  This is a fantastic camera for the price and I had no problems taking great photos on a recent vacation in auto mode.  The optical zoom was amazing, and the photos crisp and clear.!###I am still waiting for the arrival of the lens adapter and filters, as well as the package set which also includes the LCD protectors, so I am being very careful with my fantastic new camera. Add to this that i am a nature photographer, primarily, and everything is quite dead and i will have to add to review as I take more photos. I will say that the camera works great with no glitches. It arrived exactly on the due date with everything intact and working well. The pictures I have taken have been perfect. I am someone who is considered a professional, and have a degree in photography and everyone expects someone like me to have a DSL-R; but because of a very serious auto accident I can not longer carry around a heavy bag full of lenses and extra equipment, so imagine my joy over finding cameras like this. After all, a true photographer knows framing and lighting and can take a good photo with any piece of equipment.I am excited to recieve my filters and extra lenses and to put this camera to its full uses at which time I will give a more in depth review. But this camera is light, easy to hold, the pictures are clear and I am able to make good sized 300 to 600dpi prints and products. I am amazed at the amount of vacation photographers with DSLR cameras who, lets be honest, dont really know what they are doing with them... and I agree with a previous reviewer that this is no camera for a beginner. But if you want to save alot of money, not lug a heavy bag of equipment around, miss shots changing lenses, and still come away with professional quality photos, so far this camera fits the bill. It's an advanced &#34;point and shoot&#34; so if you're a beginner, I would recommend a different camera. But if you know what you are doing, this camera is, so far, working fantastically.And btw with my prime account the two day free shipping was fantastic! Once again Amazon is my favorite retailer of everything, and this is my first canon and I couldnt be happier!More to come...!###I am not sure what the mixed reviews are but this is a great fully functional camera. I am not a photographer, but I do love to take pictures. I started out with my iPhone and a Sony point and shoot. I realised I love taking pictures. So I did a lot of research this camera stood out. There is mixed reviews, but I continued to look at best buy, Walmart and amazon. The majority was anywhere from 4-5 stars all across the board. I even watched YouTube. So I decided for the price and just starting out I would give it a shot. Amazon sent it out and I began to use it. I have to say I love it, pictures are clear, movies are amazing.  I began to take pictures at the lake, nature and my dog. Came out great. I know most are saying that the camera is not good for action shots and Lowe light, if you play around with the settings it's much better. It's not a fast camera but again you can play around with that setting as well. What I found to help me is that I ordered books like canon power shot digital photography and digital photography for beginners. They have helped with the understanding of this camera.  This camera is small and compact, and it does a little of everything . It's great for me for just starting out and not mention I have has three back surgeries and unable to lug all that equipment around.  Overall this is great camera small easy to use, great pictures and a lot of fun. Like I said I am no photographer by doing a little research you can have a wonder camera. One more thing order the tri pod and extra battery it helps for the 30 x zoom it is amazing. So if you are someone looking for great camera that takes great pictures and enough settings to feel as though you are a pro, this is worth every penny.!###I have several grand invested in 35 mm film Canon equipment and it has always served me well. Changing formats is always a spendy experience, but my change to a serious digital camera has been much less so than expected. And the camera is so tiny! Virtually an entire bag of tricks in one self-contained, easy to use LITTLE camera. Great controls. Quick response. Light weight. No lens changing required! Great metering logic produces just about what I was after when I pre-visualized, even in AUTO. Easy change to MANUAL for the &#34;off the wall&#34; stuff. Most important, though, is the excellent picture quality.Did I mention how tiny this thing is..? OMG!!###This is a five star camera if you take the time to learn how to use it properly. If you just leave it on "auto," it will still take high quality still, distance, and daylight photos.However, to really get that same quality from moving targets and in low light, you must learn how to use the settings. It takes some time if you are not familiar with photography terms. Just the manual alone was not enough for me, as it assumed some knowledge that I didn't have. After taking the time to learn some basics I had a better understanding and the manual made more sense.Once you start to delve into the options and settings on this camera, it's great. There is a combination of settings for every situation, you just have to learn what they are.!###I love this camera!  I've had several Canon Powershot sx cameras over the years and loved them dearly.  I was looking for a smaller camera with a good sized zoom and found it with the sx500.  This has just about all the features my other Canons have but smaller and lighter.  I found it very easy to use and would highly recommend it!!###I'm not even enough of a photographer to be called an amateur. But we take a lot of pics at outings and on vacation. I've used inexpensive Canon point and click cameras for some time, and considered the PowerShot a serious upgrade. Wow - the wide angle and extreme zoom are great, and I've had a hard time taking bad pictures. It's very easy to use. I highly recommend this for weekend warriors who want to take descent photos, and I'd be interested to see what this baby could do in the hands of someone who relly knew photography. But I'd also recommend not trying to recycle your old 1GB chip - get something bigger :)!###I am not a camera guy, I just want to take hassel free , nice clear pictures on vacations and the odd special occasion. This camera excels at that. The small size of he camera makes it easy to take it anywhere. The auto function allows me to just point shoot and get results that I want in almost any environment. The zoom lens lets me take shots that I never thought possible. If you want easy to use camera that will do the technical work for you and produces pro like results  this is the ticket.!###The Powershot SX500 is a tool that I needed. It was either hire a photographer again or in invest in the Canon. We made the right choice, out of the box we took 50 pictures of this Balinese silver jewelry we sell. The next day all the pieces were up on the website, not one single problem. Clear as clear, took some in lowlight for ambience WOW, and the best part is I don't know a thing about taking pix. Everything for me was automatic and the results have blown me away. Next week I will be sorting out the video side which is my bag... Canon has taken a PRO camera, and aimed it at the consumer market... PROSUMER is what I have seen it referred too......five stars all the wayaussiekev-o!###I love this camera! I recently returned an Olympus DSLR camera because it was difficult to operate and the printed images were not that good. After some research I realized that what I really wanted was a point and shoot camera that was on the small side and easy to operate. Voila, this is it! I use the Auto setting right now but will try the manual settings too, although the Auto does exactly what I want it to. The camera is small but easy to handle and lightweight. Taking videos is also easy and the results are nice. The videos are clear with very natural coloring which is what I like my videos to look like. Images are also very natural looking.For someone who's not a professional photographer I see no reason to buy a DSLR when you can get a point and shoot that does such a good job. The 30 zoom and 16mp are more than enough for the casual photographer. The battery lasted through about 200 pictures and 3 short videos before I had to recharge it. I just purchased an extra battery to carry with me so I don't lose any important pictures due to the battery running out. The camera did come with a lens cover that stays attached to the camera with a wire to prevent loss. I was pleasantly surprised to see this because it didn't say a lens cover was included with this camera. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for great quality pictures and videos with ease of use.!###Being an artist I needed a camera that would take pictures of both landscapes and closeup pictures of flowers and animals.  The zoom was very important to us.  We did not want to spend the money for an SRL camera and the reviews and specs on this camera appeared to be what we were looking for.  So far this camera has been great.  We have been very happy with the quality of the photos and the ease of use.  The price on Amazon was a bit better than anywhere else we found.  We are glad we took the time to shop around.!###I think the Canon PowerShot SX500 is overall a very nice camera.  The shots are clear and the camera is easy to use.I particularly like the macro, those shots are outstanding.  The low light setting worked very well as well, indoors.  I did not have to use the flash.  I am very pleased with the video as well.  I bought the camera because of it's 30x optical zoom and the size and design of the camera. I was totally enamored with the zoom.  There were very few competitors for those two features on the market.  However, I did not rate the camera 5 stars.  The one thing I was disappointed with was the speed between photos.  (The prior reviews I had read warned me about this) So, the camera is not good for sport photos, or action shots where you want to take multiple shots in a row.  However, for a point and shoot to just grab a shot here and there such as sunsets, scenery or portraits it takes nice photos.  I use a DSLR for the sports and action shots.!###I really like to take pictures of birds and wildlife, and I was quite disappointed to find out that this camera has no &#34;continuous shooting&#34; or &#34;rapid shooting&#34; mode. Well, it does, but it's not fast. You can take a picture approximately every 2 seconds. I have a 4 year old Powershot SX10 and it can take up to 6 frames per second, and even my husband's sub-$100 Canon Elph can take around 4 frames per second!Waiting so long between photos is unacceptable if you're trying to take pictures of wild birds! I'm lucky to get ONE picture of a bird with the SX500 before it bounces around or flies away, instead of 10 or 11 with my SX10. I have missed out on a lot of shots, which is unfortunate because the 30x zoom really is great! If you like to take rapid-fire pictures of anything (wildlife, kids, pets, sports) then this is NOT the camera for you!My other gripe is with the focus when the zoom is fully extended. I'm impressed at how steady the camera is (the image stabilization really works!) but it seems like the camera has trouble locking focus at full telephoto. I have missed out on nice shots because of this issue as well.Overall picture quality is great. It's a Canon, they're all high-quality. The camera is small, lightweight, and portable. It's fun to use and I really, really wish it didn't have that unfortunate lag. I'm going to buy the SX50 instead. A little larger, a little pricier, but it's worth it if I don't have to miss out on any more great bird photos.Bottom line - don't get this camera if you need to take quick continuous photos. Most people probably don't care a whole lot about this feature but if you do it is critical.!###The SX150 (the upgrade to this) has just been two days ago, be sure to check the new products here --> [...]Now there's 1080p too on the SX 150!!###I was looking for a simple to use camera that could zoom up close and help with my shakiness.  I haven't had any trouble at all following the instructions except for forgetting to lift up the flash bulb when needed :-( although there is a prompt!! Photos once downloaded are awesome! I've been very happy with this purchase and would recommend it again.  BTW this camera comes with a rechargeable lithium battery which I think is  a &#34;must have&#34; instead of AAA batteries.  I've only had to recharge it once since I purchased it after over 300 photos!!!###I'm a die hard DSL user but wanted a smaller, more compact camera to take hiking, boating etc, instead of lugging around my big camera. I was very surprised to find that the PowerShot (and I'm guessing other point & shoots) are so much more complicated to use than the DSL's.Pro's: Price is right, it's light and compact and easy to carry around, additional batteries are reasonable (15$ for 2), it has fun features that take the place of specialty lenses, and when you get a good shot, it's a really good shot.Con's: It can be difficult to get it to focus where you want it to focus, many times it tells you subject is in focus and it's not, features don't always work when telephoto is engaged and the battery has a short lifespan (90 minutes and/or about 200 photos. however the batteries are small and cheap enough that it's easy to have extra available to switch out.)I'm still playing around with the different shooting modes and hopefully will get in sync with it for consistently good shots. The advanced user manual is okay...but it must be for several cameras because it tells me to go to things on the menu that I don't have icons for on my camera. It has been helpful though.Update: I've found shooting in "Live" mode, all the features work and am getting much more consistant quality. Equal to what I get with my DSL. You definitely want to turn on the AF Point Zoom feature to magnify the focus area and make sure the camera is focusing where you think it is. Am still playing and figuring it all out, but am much more optimistic about it now.!###This camera is great compared to my larger Canon. It took a while to get used to the automatic focus but I wish the flash was automatic as well. I always forget to put it up and the pictures sometimes come out grainy. I do love the fact that it has a video camera on it though and works great to just always have with you for that moment when you need it but don't want to carry around all the lenses and cases. Also the zoom and focus on this camera is great. I can see about an acre away in clear picture!###This is my 4th PowerShot camera, and for the money, it's well worth it.  I couldn't justify getting a DSR camera, but I still wanted a better zoom than my 4x on my old PowerShot.  I was not disappointed.  Although my A620 still takes good pictures, it was hit-and-miss when taking photos using the zoom.  I would say that 50% of the time the camera would have trouble focusing using the zoom.  Not so with this camera.  I tested the zoom feature on the SX500 and didn't have any trouble focusing using the zoom.  I also had trouble focusing up close (about 3 ft) without using the zoom on my A620.  Again, I had no problem with the SX500.  Inside and outside photos look great.  Although this camera uses a rechargeable batter pack, battery life seems good.  The display is a good size, and the controls are easier to use and non-intrusive.  There are a couple of minor negatives, however.  The flash is a little difficult to flip up.  I also wish there was a view finder.  Otherwise, I am very pleased so far.!###Light weight, pretty easy to use, still learning all the detail stuff. Very reasonable price. Way better than the Kodak Easy Share that I had. This takes beautiful pics. Down load easily onto computer.!###Bought this one over the weekend. So far so good.  Not a pro, but wanted something a little better than a compact point and shoot.  The body is lightweight, yet surprisingly sturdy. To get used to it, I took pics of the dog in different lighting w/ and w/o flash.  They came out pretty clear. Took some outdoor photos using zoom and regular focus. Not bad at all.  Zoom came in nice and clear.  Anyone who has this camera and could advise me on the best functions to use for taking photos of moving objects (i.e. Christmas displays, etc.), outdoor scenery, etc.) I would appreciate it! Thanks!!###Bought this camera for my Alaskan Cruise vacation. Everything works as advertized. Got some really great shots on cloudy days, indoors without flash and many other situations.The zoom function is unbelievably good. I did buy a monopod for these deep zoom shots, but i quickly found out that the camera does a great job compensating for any shake. Even at 60 x zoom I took some great and clear hand held shots.The main drawback is the lack of a viewfinder. On bright sunny days all you see is your reflection on the LCD screen. Total washout of all detail and color. So in that situation it becomes point and guess, not point and shoot.The recovery between shots is also quite long.Great movie camera even if its only 720p HD.Battery life OK unless its very cold (like in Alaska at 5 AM). Buy an extra batteryI'll try one of those anti-glare screen protectors to see if that improves the situation.Overall, great camera if you can live without a viewfinder.!###I bought this camera for my intro to photography class and it was worth the money!! I love the 30X zoom and the pictures are so clear. This is a great alternative to the $1000 DSLR camera's that were no where in my budget. Even though I'm a beginner, I take pictures with this camera like a pro :). So far, so good!!###Pretty easy to figure out, even for the un-tech type. Picture clarity and brightness surprisingly good. I would recommend it.!###I first want to write I originally purchased the Canon PowerShot SX510 for the same price as this camera thinking I was getting more camera for my money. I was wrong, I returned that camera, purchased this one and glad I did. My whole reason for upgrading my camera (I had a Canon SX210 which is an excellent camera) was to get a better zoom. The 30X zoom is fantastic but needs the 16 megapixels to make crisp, clear pictures when you crop them. The camera I returned only had 12 megapixels and the pictures taken with the zoom were blurry when cropped. The camera body is bigger than the SX210, easy to hold and the buttons easy to use for people that have hand problems. The lag time is minimal between shots and has the picture burst feature that gets you great action series shots (tried it out on taking pictures of my dog catching her Frisbee). The camera takes great pictures in low and artificial light, this is another reason I wanted this camera. I don't video a lot so I cannot review that feature of this camera. For the short time I have had this camera I feel it was a great value purchase.!###I have had my Canon SX500 IS for about a year.  My initial requirements for this camera were that it be light, easy to pack in a backpack, high resolution, big optical zoom, high (not perfect) image quality and easy to use on the move.  The SX500 IS meets all of these criteria.  The battery lasts for all day shooting, and with a 64GB SanDisk Ultra memory card, I can shoot all day and not run out of memory.The only negative, I miss having a viewfinder.  For on the go shooting, I have never been a fan of Live View imaging.Pros:  Light, easy to use, good image quality.Cons: Live View shooting only.Recommend to others: Yes!###Almost didn't buy this because of the &#34;Not a good beginner camera&#34; review. Wanted an easy to use camera with a lot of zoom and small enough to fit in my motorcycle side bag. Bought it 8/13 and took a 6500 mile bike trip. Put the camera on auto and made sure the stabilizer feature was on. Took 400 ish pictures, many in a hurry sitting at roadside on the bike.  For me, 99% are great, clear pictures showing me what I had seen traveling America.  Have taken several thousand pictures since and as long as I keep my settings as stated I get great pictures.Just like my phone that I only want to talk on, I want a camera that works well without learning the 100 things it may be able to do.!###I got the SX500 IS as an upgrade from my 8 year old Lumix, not wanting to go full DSLR, but maybe something in between.  Portable, inexpensive, yet with a high optical zoom and good image stability.  There are undoubtedly other models with better features that take higher quality pictures, including Canon's own SX50, but none for under $200 that I could find.  Checking on reviews at various sites also led me to believe the SX500 IS was at least comparable, and usually better than the other 30x "ultra" zoom cameras.After playing around with it a few days, mostly on the Auto setting, I'm very happy with the optical zoom and the image stability you get at 30x, better than I got with the Lumix at 10x.  Macro shots at an inch or less look great, at least in good light.  Low light shots get very grainy as the ISO kicks up to 800 very quickly so I'll be playing with the manual settings more there.  Tons of those settings that I'll have to really study--as another review pointed out, this isn't a beginner's camera, but then I didn't want one and am willing to dive into the details a bit.Possible cons: movies are "only" at 720, but look plenty good (for 1080, maybe consider the SX50?).  The aperture speed was rated low for this camera at just under 1 sec.  Haven't taken any high speed shots yet, say a bird in flight, so I can't comment on it yet.  The battery life is also supposedly short, but I always get a spare (2 for $15).  My maybe biggest gripe is the awkward shape, which is to say the lens is very long, so the camera is very boxy.  I don't want to get yet another dedicated camera bag, and it doesn't fit into any of my laptop backpacks or satchels very well.  It's not a big camera, it's just not very flat in any 2 dimensions, so just... awkward.All in all, this was a fantastic value, and hopefully a gateway into better photography.  I'll update this review after delving more into the finer points of the camera.Update (9/3/2013): I see the price has gone up past $250, and the "super zooms" have gone to 50X.  Having done some sports stadium shooting from the back fence to full zoom on the field, I can capture closeups of plays, even fastballs leaving the pitcher's hand from 200-300ft away, so I'm more than happy with 30X, and the stability is very impressive, at least in full daylight (perfect conditions).  Still need to test at, say, nighttime concerts, but I still think this is an excellent value, even in the $250 range, and a steal for under $200.!###I researched this product for a long time. My photography consists of family events and vacations. We have 3 children so I take lots of birthday parties and school performances. Canon is the way to go! After having a Nikon that I was dissatisfied with I tried this camera. It took amazing pictures of my daughter's 10th birthday party. The colors are super sharp and defined. It takes pictures that are clear without the flash. It is super easy to use for taking the pictures and adding them to the computer. My husband has the much more advanced Canon EOS and even he was impressed with this cameras photo quality. I would recommend it.!###The camera is small (compact). I would not suggest the use of this camera if aempting to take sports/action pictures. The camera is unable to capture anything thats fast in motion. BUT the quality of photos turn out pretty nice. A great beginner camera.!###I love this superzoom camera. It has a 30x optical zoom but has a feature called "Smart Zoom"(which is not traditional digital zoom which it also has) that lets you get to 60x zoom and retain sharp details.  This is the first camera that I have tried where the "Smart Zoom" does what it claims.  Really an excellent feature.Pros:30x optical zoomNice color reproductionCompactFull featured manual modesAuto modes work very niceExcellent image quality in good lightCons:Noisy in low lightBurst rate is very poorWill need a second battery, about 150-190 images per chargeFor a camera in the 200.00 - 300.00 range, it is an excellent value!!###The PowerShot is great for normal shooting but for real distance you definitely need a tripod. For stills the photos are very sharp and clean but if you try and take advantage of the 30X zoom or anywhere close to 30x the camera becomes vey sensitive to movement. This is not a camera for taking shoots of things that are even slightly moving. That being said we shoot pictures of wildlife that live in the wetlands behind our house and with the use of the 30x zoom and a tripod we've gotten some amazing shoots. Sometimes it takes 4 or 5 shots to get a good one but it's worth it. The regular still shots using some telephoto to crop come out amazing. The PowerShot uses a special rechargeable batteries so I also bought a couple of spare batteries (they are not very expensive) and keep them charged in the camera bag. One last thing. Be sure you buy a standard size SD memory card. The camera does not come with one and will not work without it as there is no on board memory.!###The camera met our expectations. It is easy to use. I like the zoom feature,making it easy to take pictures of the wildlife in our yard!###I was looking for something that had a few more details than a pointand shoot, was light weight and took great pics. This little camera is superb! It is very light weight and small enough to fit in most purses. The pictures come out perfect. It basically is set up as a point and shoot but is very easy to understand and adjust settings if necessary. I bought the camera to use for my grandson's first birthday party and it more than met my expectations! Purchase a 32GB SD card and you will be able to take pictures and movie clips to your heart's content without worrying about running out of space.I plug the SD card directly into my computer and transfer of pictures is a breeze. This little camera will be enjoyed by photo buffs as well as the casual picture taker!!###My husband recently purchased this camera for use on our farm.  We like to take pictures of the wildlife that hang around our ponds.  This camera is absolutely perfect for our use.  Very easy to use and the zoom is unbelievable.  The only draw back that I can see so far is that it is a rechargeable battery, which I intend to remedy by ordering a spare battery.  Great camera for the price.  Couldn't be happier with it.!###I thought this was a &#34;normal&#34; size camera but, its no different than any other &#34;aim and shoot&#34;  I didnt like my hand around it. Drove me insane.!###The camera works ok but the software that came with it stinks. Frequently the images come up blurry and it is not easy to use. I regret buying this.!###i was shopping all the time from this website . what's wrong with the package this time ????it DOESN'T have a memory !!i need a memory or i need to return this order.let me know please ASAP ,!###For months, I been camera shopping and then I found the Canon SX500. It is a great advanced point and shoot camera. I was surprised to read some of the reviews how people were comparing it to an SLR camera. You cannot compare an SX500 to an SLR. There is no comparison! If you're on a budget or cannot afford an SLR camera, then this is a great camera. I highly recommend it!!###Purchased this camera for a vacation in lieu of carrying a bulky SLR camera+ accessories. This camera was really good in taking all of the basic vacation photographs. They came out very good and we hardly missed the big SLR camera features (except photographs in low lights, which require bigger flash). Very pleased with its performance.!###Fantastic camera, does really good at close ups and well, all the pictures I have taken. I am so glad I got this as a gift to myself!!!###I love the zoom. it's perfect size and works well. Photos are clean and clear. I feel like a professional photograher&#62;!###The camera seems solid and takes good pictures when you can figure out how to use it. Like most cameras the AUTO setting does not do the best job, especially indoors. It has plenty of setting to compensate and set up what you need except the instructions for this are only PDF. Hard to take out in the field with you. Like most company provided software it sucks. It wants to take over everything. It will not allow me to set my save to folder on my server drive, not sure why. When the cable is hooked up and you browse to the memory card you can only get MS Office Picture Manager to open one photo and not browse the entire folder. That is to say you have to open each one separately and then any that have been opened will show in  the program. If you want have control over how your photos are handled don't go this route. All of this would not be an issue if the memory card was accessible from outside the battery compartment. If you use a tripod and have the mount on the camera bottom it blocks access to the battery door. You have to remove the mount, open the door, remove the card, transfer your photos, reinsert the card close the door and  screw the mount back on if you want to transfer your photos in a manner that works with windows the way you are used to. This is very inconvenient. Maybe just me I need control of how my photos are handled.!###After much research I decided to get the SX500 Canon.I did not want a &#34;pocket camera&#34;, or an SLR (out of my price range as well as photography level). Wanted a nice camera to capture moments of my family and 5 children.Pro's:-Amazing still photos-Nice size and gripCon's:-The dim light photos were a complete failure even after setting and adjusting different things.-The flash was obnoxiously bright and over flashed the photo to &#34;white washing&#34; the picture.-No matter the setting for scene, if the flash was not on, there was no chance of it focusing (even doing the 1/2 depression for focus then full depression).-The shutter speed is ridiculously slow! Over 3 seconds IF it even took the photo.-Any kind of action scene is out of the question.Specifically bought this to capture my brothers wedding my husband and I were both attendants in, and managed to get about 15 photos to tun out remotely identifiable (and about 5 perfect still shots)  from the whole weekend. Very sad. After such high reviews, I am not sure what to think. I am not professional, but am very much aware how to work a camera and the lighting needed to get nice photos. I have a camera in my hand at almost all times.So I returned it and have gone with the Nikon 510!###EDITed after Hawaii trip. Canon always takes good pictures, and this one is no exception. (EDIT: Really good pictures) My complaint is the lack of a viewfinder, but the trade off for 30x zoom is good, and the screen is large and bright. We'll see on our Hawaii trip next month. (EDIT: OK, not great in the sun. The lack of a viewfinder is a rather large drawback) Battery life is a bit lacking, but may improve with usage. (EDIT: Seems okay now) Just got the camera. (Bought an extra battery.) Low light is okay, room light takes descent pics without flash as long as no one moves. IS helps on zoomed shots, but care is still needed, since your are holding the camera away from your face. (no viewfinder)Good purchase. EDIT: good for the money, great pictures, recommend a viewfinder, spend a bit more for that if you can.!###We are grateful to Amazon for the ability to return this camera. The focusing screen was never &#34;in focus;&#34; the quality of the images was very poor, even using the fine quality jpeg option. Tremendous amount of noise at all ISO numbers, shutter lag made it impossible to take multiple photos. We are semi-pro photographers, and needed the camera for quick snapshots. We are Canon camera enthusiasts, but not for this model. Perhaps ours was defective? Regardless of the reason, this camera has changed our minds about using Canon as a manufacturer for inexpensive cameras.!###Don't understand why some  people said this camera feels &#34;cheap.&#34;  Feels like a camera to me.  And, it performs like a camera should.  Wore out its counterpart from eleven years ago, and am impressed with the features they pack into this  one at a reasonable price.  Don't really like not having a written manual, but that is the way it is these days.  I do a lot of point-and-shoot for vacation pictures, and often use some of the basic additions.  Would recommend this to everyone except the hard-line purist and the raw data wannabees.!###Was pleased with this camera to begin with...lost it first of Feb. 2014, and found it in the woods in the mountains of Western NC.  It had been out in rain, lots of sub-freezing weather, and having 10 inches of snow melting on it.  After two weeks of this it still works perfectly!  Amazing!  The dog of a neighbor found it for us.!###After reading the rave reviews on this camera, I have to say I'm very disappointed on the macro or up close photography. I bought this primarily for taking photos of my pottery for my web site, etsy site etc. Using the macro setting produces a curved distorted look to the item. I have tried a number of settings, changing my distances etc with no change. The colors are not the best either and they appear very fake.The position of a number of the control buttons is also awkward, and I constantly hit them while trying to take shots.The zoom lens is wonderful and I have been successful taking photos of birds etc, but unfortunately that was not the reason I bought this camera.Overall this has been a waste of money for me and my intended use...too bad.!###Someone bought me a camera 2 years ago, unfortunately without asking me what I wanted .... I tried and tried to get used to it but I could not. This camera came by mail and form the first second intuitively I can do do anything I want with it. I am so happy to be into taking pictures (and movies) again. Good quality pictures and excellent feel holding it. I love it indeed. (And I love the fact that I can put it on manual)!###My wife loved it. it takes great pictures. I would suggest getting a second battery pack so you are never down.!###Bought this camera specifically for my road trip out west to Yellowstone from Ohio. This camera takes wonderful photos up close. Seriously the micro-camera mode is amazing. The 30x optical zoom is nice, but not as amazing as I had hoped. Still pretty good though. Main disappointment is no viewfinder, or eye hole or whatever...just has the LCD screen which is fairly large. Also has a built-in gyroscope to automatically flip photos when viewing.I used a mode (not sure what it's called) to take photos at night without a flash. This was good for taking pictures of stars and wooded scenery at night. It works well, but you have to keep the camera perfectly still. You can check out the images on flickr if you want. Username, chrisjjh07!###Takes great pictures....if the subject is standing completely still.  I took this to a concert and it was really tough to get a good still shot.  It took great looking video, but the audio sounds terrible.  On the plus side, the zoom feature works nicely.!###This camera is definitely a great value.  But if you are a photography purist, don't even waste your time with this product.  First of all, if you're such a purist, you shouldn't even be looking in this price range.  Move up to the Rebel 70D, and don't try to impress the masses with your higher than average expectations not being met by a camera that costs less than the lens of a Rebel 70D.  That being said, you will get satisfactory pictures, if you are a being a tourist, attending a party, or out with the family.  This isn't a camera that will photograph a still hummingbird, and it will not give you good, large format, poster-quality pictures either.  First of all, it adds lots of fake color pixels, which become visible once you zoom in to your pictures on your computer.  The quality of the image is also not the best, as the images can look rather grainy when you expand them to their correct size on your screen.  What do you get then?  Well, you get beautiful 5x7 album pictures, and you might even get a decent 11x17 small poster.  Beyond that, you should not consider this camera as an option.  If you're going to a hockey game, you might also want to steer clear from this camera.  Especially in auto mode, the camera takes up to three full seconds to focus and shoot a picture.  Even in TV mode where you are supposedly in control of the shutter speed, it is very slow to react.  This is not the best camera for a sporting event, that's for sure.  Also, make sure you purchase a memory card, as the camera does not have one included.  The camera will perform very well in low light conditions, and it has a very decent zoom for a camera this small.  Speaking of small, this camera will not fit in your pockets.  But it is small enough that it didn't bother me to carry it on my hand.Overall I give the camera a 4 star rating, mostly because in its native image mode of 4608x3456 pixels, the images appear slightly blurred.  That's because the actual resolution of this camera is rather low, 180 dots-per-inch.  For the kind of money you'll be spending, you will be able to keep beautiful, natural-colored, and vivid album pictures.  And that's OK with me if you're just being a tourist, and you'd rather not get whacked in the head over a Leica, or regretting for a long time that your children forgot your EOS 5D Mark III in a bathroom stall.!###I did a lot of research on just the right camera to buy.  Our daughter was just born and I wanted a camera that would capture every moment.  We are so impressed with the quality & zoom of this camera.  It's easy to use, you can edit the video's, you can capture details & the pictures are crystal clear!  This camera is a great buy.!###I researched many point and shoot cameras prior to a trip to Africa. The Canon took the win due to price and features. The camera never let me down, often allowing me the option of a marvelous shot at full zoom. The only downside(s) were lag time between shots and flash not always firing when necessary. This is a great camera for the price!!###Really nice camera for amateurs. Good price too. Zoom great. Little bulky if you want to be discreet but great for vacation. Good battery life. Takes beautiful pictures.!###You get what you pay for.  However, if you are looking for a cheap costing camera that will give you pretty superb quality pictures this is the way to go.  The only little annoying thing I could find is that you have to manually raise the flash.  Would I buy one again?  Probably.!###bought this as a birthday present for my husband who needed an upgrade,my tech savvy son called it the best in it's price range, picture quality is excellent, zoom is amazing, extremely happy with purchase, prompt and efficient service from supplier.!###Is super cam, is perfect and has a good price everithing the video is perfect, of course is a good brand I just love it.!###I take lots of pictures of the grands and I love the zoom...I can catch those moments when they don't know you're looking!###I wanted an easy to use camera with a decent zoom. This is just what I wanted at the right price.!###I bought this camera because a Nikon I bought a few months before had just been sent back for a second repair.  I don't like the idea of being without a camera on our family outings so decided to splurge on this second camera.  The zoom is incredible, stronger than some of my binoculars! The pictures so far seem to be of really nice quality.  Excited to use it more.I've had the camera a couple of months now and absolutely love it!  The pictures are really good quality compared to other cameras that I've had.  Love the powerful zoom too.  Just wish I would have discovered this camera before I bought my Nikon.!###My last camera's memory slot just...borked. Stopped locking the memory card in place, so it became useless, and it was time for an upgrade anyway.I can't even express in words how happy I am with this camera. It's such a step up, and the price is fantastic! Anyone complaining about, well, anything, is probably trying to compare it to a dslr or something. It's not a dslr. This is a point and shoot. And it does amazing things for being a point and shoot.The zoom function is crazy. The macro is amazing.If you're looking for a rugged, take anywhere, fast camera, this isn't the one. It's a little slow and you need to hold it steady if you don't have a tripod. But if you want a camera to take beautiful pictures of macro subjects, and you can't afford a dslr, get this one.!###I use this camera for photos only and the pictures are superb for the price. Once you charge the camera and insert an SD card you'll be ready to snap pictures. Its very user friendly and is a great consumer camera!!###This is a great camera. Automatic flash flip up would be better, but for the $$$ you can't have it all. At least it tells you when you need flash. Zoom is awesome for the price. I really like this one.!###excellent camera, very pleased with this product, easy to use, have had a lot of fun taking photos.  This is the fourth Canon camera I have, the others have been the elph series, this is light weight and has some very cool effects built in.  Would recommend this camera for the above average photographer!###This camera is small and very light, takes good pictures but is a little slow in recycle mode. Focusing doesn't always work very fast. This camera is great for the price so can't expect wonders for the low price. I wouldn't recommend this camera for a person that is really into cameras!###Do explain why you liked or disliked this product.  muchas gracias por su serviciosDo identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort & fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.!###I don't like it , i purchased it when i looked at the photo on amazon website it was looking like a big camera but in reality it's small , and the it doesn't capture a good photos , i really hate it!###Do not buy, Better quality pictures on my iPhone, very disappointed in this camera. Will be returning this camera ASAP .!###Well, I can't comment on how great the camera is/isn't because IT DOESN'T COME WITH A MEMORY CARD!  I have a 10 year old Power Shot, and while it takes pretty good pictures, the shutter speed is slow, so I decided it was time for a new camera.  Once I order a memory card and get it installed, I'll be able to tell you how good/bad this camera is.  I think that's pretty cheesy that it doesn't come with a memory card--the old one did!!###1st. the shutter reaction is so slow objects have left the frame!2nd. battery life is less than 2 hours3rd. no Manual! you have to load a disc and the PDF is so large you can't carry it into the field for support.I've been a devoted Canon owner for years. That just ended.I feel totally ripped off and out $200 bucks.Moral...NEVER RECYCLE The box until you are SURE!!###After listening to everyone I know say how great Canon cameras are and this being my first Canon I was pretty excited when I ordered it. The body has a cheap and flimsy feel to it. The flash you have to manually lift to make it operational. And the picture quality is so so. Needless to say I sent it back after a day. Purchased a Panasonic FZ60 and it's like night and day. Now I'm happy.!###it took a long time to focus so i return it and buy a Fuji instead this was my gf so she was the one who told me this it was a gift!###I've had several cameras and this one took me by surprise. I couldn't believe I had to manually lift up the flash whenever  I needed to use it.By now Cannon should incorporate auto face recognition into their cameras. Didn't like having to set the timer and wait to take my photo, it was crazy.The mechanical parts in this camera is noisy and I'm wondering if it will last a long time.I'm so very disappointed with the shipping of this item that ended up at the wrong address causing me to incur a significant additional cost of US $120.53Overall the photos came out not too bad!###It was my fault because I thought I read that it stopped action and I wanted a continuous shooting action.The zoom lens did not always go in all the way.!###I ordered this one by mistake...it looks like a nice little camera but there were features I wanted that were on another model!###My kids are difficult to get a good picture of.  I yell at them to stop kicking the ball or shooting at the basket so I can take their picture but their coaches always yell &#34;Keep Playing&#34;!  Since it doesn't have a sports setting, my pictures are blurry.  so, I just pretend that I am asleep and dreaming and everything is a little fuzzy when I look at the pictures.  The camera fits well in my hand which was damaged in a Congonese plastic water gun factory accident.!###I purchased this camera after much research and comparison shopping with other businesses and felt like this was the best style and model for my needs. Initially, I was thrilled with my purchase and am now happy I waited to review this product. Things have changed, quickly and dramatically for the worse...After using the camera roughly 20 times since it arrived, the zoom has stopped working, which renders the camera useless. And as luck would have it, although i am a Prime member for 3 years, I am unable to return the product. I still have the original packaging (it conveniently did not arrive with a printed receipt, which I notice happens frequently with my purchases through Amazon). Perhaps an oversight on their part... I have recommended Amazon to family, coworkers and friends and have purchased thousands and thousands of dollars worth of merchandise through Amazon. I will no longer buy from Amazon after this experience due to my complete dissatisfaction with this camera and their convoluted return policy. Basically I  have a 200 dollar useless trinket and gave my old camera away so I can no longer take photos, which is something I enjoy tremendously. Thanks Amazon (not so much)...!###I purchased this camera with the sole intent to take to my vacation in Yosemite however after the first couple of days on my trip I was very disappointed. The auto settings were taking some very washed out pictures. If I control everything manually I could get some really good ones, but having to do that when all you want is to snap and take some good pictures is a pain. So I ended up having to do that for much of my vacation, and then I also had to manually edit some pictures after the fact. The shutter is super slow also, and you have to hold the shutter button for a while for the picture to snap. Also I don't like having to manually pop up the flash, seems like it should just pop up by itself. I was going to return the camera when I got back but ended up taking too long and now it's past the return policy date. Bummer, I am really not happy with it. Also the battery goes down very fast, couldn't go for 2 days of shooting without having to charge it.!###for the money its a really nice camera,only have it 1 month and so far so good,also bought  the carrying case!###hi, my charger dose not work so i cant charge my camera. I need a charger i dont know what to do?!###Its a good c&aacute;mara but it is not as expected. But relation price product is good. I thougth could be better because of description.!###Every picture taken with this camera is blurry. I have gone through Canon troubleshooting and made adjustments suggested by the manual. No luck. Horrible pictures.I have previously owned a Nikon L series and plan on purchasing the newer version.!###If you intend just to take pictures, this camera will suffice. However, taking a movie is out of the question. I have tried countless times, but it only gives me a couple of seconds worth of distorted slow motion movies. It is very disappointing. This has got to be the worst cannon camera that I have ever owned!!  I certainly would NOT recommend this to anyone.!###I haven't had this camera more than 48 hours and haven't had time to really dive into how all it's functions work.  I have had it long enough to miss a lot of the usefulness of the camera it's supposed to replace.  I had a Canon Powershot S2 IS, until it's sensor cover started sticking and it doesn't function every other shot.  Cost as much to replace as to repair so here I am.First:  Auto setting?  Um, when I zoomed with the S2 I could focus immediately.  The SX500 I received is going right back to original focus with or without the flash.  I understand from info I'm finding on line that this is an IS issue.  I don't use a tripod to get pics of my pets.  I usually don't have time or room to set one up before the scene changes.  Auto setting gets a thumbs down.Looking at the settings dial I miss the infinity focus.  I miss the scene settings that auto adjust for indoor or snow pics.  Fisheye is novel but not enough to get a spot here.  Where's black and white?  I'm really going to miss the articulating LCD screen.  Don't miss the little view finder since I didn't use the S2's view finder.  That's one feature I really like, that the view finder is not wasting space and weighting down the camera.  Oh, and it fits so nicely in my hand.  I miss the weight but can get used to this.  I miss using AA batteries.  I was feeding my S2 after every 10-20 shots in the end but it was the convenience of a pre-charged power source available anywhere that I wanted.  I remember my camcorder and it's battery pack!One pic:  The one shot I did keep on the card I had on hand was a pic of a calculator from 2 feet away.  It focused acceptably and I could zoom in on the saved pic and read the buttons.  I'll have to see if it looks amazing on my computer after I download it.  Haven't done anything with the software yet and don't really plan to unless I have to.  I didn't use the S2's software either.Ok, on the battery pack:  The little bugger only took about an hour and a half to charge!  Nice.  I can live with that.  Hope the extras work as well.  No idea how long it will last just yet.  I plan to give the zoom a workout so I should be able to tell pretty soon.  I'll have to come back and update as I learn more about this camera and decide if I'm returning it or not.Oh, and the SX20 IS is on it's way.  It should work just like I expect.  I'll review it after I receive it.!###Terrible camera!  The worse one I have ever used!  You can use disposable camera that perform better than this one.  The auto focus drowns out your photos!  Too much lighting!  Of course you can tweak the settings, if you had time, but for a quick point and shoot camera, this is NOT the one.  Also, many of my photos get out of focus.  When the flash is not on, the pictures are distorted!  When the flash is on, there usually is too much light cast on people's faces.The default size of the pictures are set really small, which you might as well delete every photo you take.  It is REALLY HARD to figure out how to change the default setting to a higher quality image.  And even at that, the "higher quality" image is not really higher quality.The battery is the worse battery life I have ever seen.  I would rather use a 99 Cent Store battery than this one.  Granted that you can recharge it, but when you are out taking pictures, the battery drains SUPER FAST.  If you take video, you might get 10 minutes from it before the battery is depleted!The only cool feature is the zoom lens, which can zoom pretty darn far, for the small size of this camera.!###Was going to replace a canon SD 990 IS. Sadly the SD 990 IS is an outrageous $700 these days. Wonder why? I purchased it for $300 more than 3 years ago. Otherwise I would buy the same camera again! Either way, the SX 500 IS went back the same day. I waited for this camera for so long and read so much about it. I am not a professional, that's why I went with this camera. I needed a point and shoot camera, small enough to fit in my purse, yet something with a lot of zoom and pixels. There is quite a few pros to this camera, for example zoom while video taping. Yet the cons are outweighing.When I first handled the camera I noticed  the body and weight feel very cheap. Might be a plus to some people?!In any possible pre set position I could NOT get ONE picture of my kids or dogs moving, that was not blurry. Even slow motion will turn any picture unusable. This might be a good camera for still pictures?! Make sure nothing is moving while pushing the button. Also the flash will not come open automatically. It has to be manually opened whenever it is needed. Like I said, I am not a professional and that's why I picked this one in the first place. I also did not keep the camera long enough to find out more pros and cons. Back to more research! Any suggestions are welcome!!###ITS A GOOD STUFF  I LOVE AND LIKE IT  THE IMAGE IS VERY FINE AND HIGH CUALITYBUT I NEED SOME HELP  I WANT THE COMMERCIAL INVOICE PLEASE IN THE FAST TIME POSSIBLETHANKS A LOT!###I LOVE this camera.  You can read all the other reviews about it and form your own opinion...I just will put this here so people don't blame the camera:The SD card that comes with the camera is NOT compatible (odd, I know).  You are best advised to buy one separately.  I use a SanDisk and can say that it is compatible and works well.That is all.!###I have been a Canon fan for several years however this camera is not up to Canon standards.  the digital zoom is useless.  even the regular zoom on a tripod in excellent lighting conditions, the pictures are grainy and of poor quality.  I will stick to my T3i which is a much better camera.  I have an old 4MP Powershot (SD300) takes better photos than this camera. Save your money and apply it towards a DSLR camera.!###This camera has great 30x zoom but pictures are not nearly as good as with my older SX120IS with 10x zoom.  Older pictures are sharper and brighter all shot from the same location and subjects.  Since both cameras are PowerShots the features are the same but very disappointed in the quality of the images.  More later.!###This camera has a powerful telephoto lens...and when it works its great...But you must make sure there are no bugs in your camera's lens mechanism...  You are getting a lot of telephoto for your money here...so use it a lot right away...just to be assured that you don't have issues...!###I don't know what's happend but the camera is dropped when you turn off, so every time when you turn on you start having problem with the camera!###This is the lamest camera, I wish I had spent the extra money and bought something better.... the photos aren't bad but the camera is extremely slow to snap a picture!###We used this Camera on our Vacation to Hilton Head Island, SC.  Love the simple features!  It takes Great photos!  I like how you can use the close-up button to take photos of my Food Recipes for my online use!!###This camera got good reviews, should have gone to a store to see what it actually looked like before I purchased on line. Was a little disappointed it has no view finder (to look through to take pictures) but I am trying to adjust to taking pictures through the video display(?). Always getting the &#34;hand&#34; in the upper right hand corner because apparently I am a little shaky. It's difficult to hold a camera steady to take pictures. Some good pictures, some not so good. Has good zoom capabilities not really sure I would recommend because I am not really sure I like it. If you like looking through a keyhole to take a picture, this camera IS NOT for you.!###This little gem replaces a 6X optic little pocket camera. The price was wonderful too. I already own a tri-pod and, with a 1,500 memory card - I am off to park, beach, mountain and in my neighborhood taking great pictures!!###Generally speaking, it's a great camera. However, it is horrible in low light situations. I haven't used the flash since I mostly shoot outside though. Sometimes it doesn't always focus properly right away in automatic/intelligent auto mode. The burst mode is not very fast... not many frames per second. Everything else is pretty good though.!###Bought this after viewing many cameras.  I have started to use it and find the ease of use and the high quality pictures that are produced are very satisfying.  Easy to use and the downloaded manual is great to review along with the one you can put into your camera bag.  Going on a trip to Alaska this year and I am looking forward to taking many pictures.  Great buy!  Great price!!###I did some research, and this camera met most of my needs. The zoom was great. We spent two weeks in Sedona and Grand Canyon and loved the way it worked. I should have taken more time to become familiar with it before the trip though. A very important thing for me is the battery life.It was better than I expected. I don't know how many pictures it took, but there was always battery left at the end of the day. The picture clarity was extraordinary. I thought it might be too bulky as I used to have a little camera but it is worth the extra size to have a wide angle and powerful 30x zoom.The only thing this camera did not have that would have been nice is wifi, But it is so easy to pull the SD card and slip it ibnto the computer it is not really an issue. I highly recommend it.!###I just purchased this camera based on the great reviews I have read and I wanted soooo bad to like it. It was cute, light and compact, it had all features I needed for a point and shoot camera, but was extremely disappointed with the picture quality. I had quite a few  point and shoot cameras before so I have something to compare it with. You would think that this canon sx500 would perform better and not worst than the little tiny cameras out there since it's so much bigger and has a great lens. I have tried both the auto mode and the manual modes, but the color, contrast and sharpness of the pictures were not at all what you'd expect. The price was amazing $199 at Best Buy this week, unfortunately I will return it and buy one of those little cameras again, at least they won't take as much space in my purse/pocket. Don't waste your money, it looks like a great camera, but the smaller ones do a better job than this one does.!###A nice easy to handle camera that takes great pictures and gets good shots with excellent wide angle and long views.!###Returned it yesterday. Looking for  camera to travel with so I don't have to take my Rebel EOS. It's not this one. Took it on a trip and the outdoor pictures were OK, not great, but OK. Problem was with the inside photos coming out grainy and sometimes blur. The Flash doesn't pop up when needed, there is a message on the screen to manually lift up the flash. Sometimes it prompts the flash, sometimes it doesn't. It is lightweight and compact, but picture quality suffers. First negative experience I've had with a Canon product.!###Simple to use but with more sophisticated options. Takes the best photos of any camera I have owned. Great zoom for an amateur photographer like me and for an inexpensive camera.!###I wanted a nicer camera that could take great wide angle landscape shots and I was not disappointed by this camera.  It's solid, easy to use for super noob digital camera people, comes with a connector cable to easily transfer to a computer.Our trip was to Alaska, and the scenery was profound.  I couldn't stop taking pictures of it and the camera never let me down.  The zoom was perfect for the scenic touring we did especially since the sheer size of everything was so large, but also so distant.Battery life was great, but I turned it off between uses.  Came with a handy strap to carry around the neck and a lense cover.  I purchased the Case Logic DCB-304 Compact System/Hybrid Camera Case (Black) for it and an extra memory card.!###I love this camera ! Easy to use takes terrific pictures even in low light! My grand daughter was in a play and we were towards the back of the auditorium. I took a video and was able to zoom enough to get a great picture, clear and perfect. Out doors I took a video of her on a faris wheel not knowing which car she was I and was able to see her very clearly when I zoomed in on my computer. I'm very happy with this multi functional camera. I would like to have a cover or hood over the screen but it's great for the price. The flash doesn't pop up automatically and there isn't a view finder but if you don't mind that its a great buy.!###I really like the megapixel amount. It really makes the pictures better. It is used for research and clarity is utmost in importance.!###Very difficult to take clear pictures with this camera. Very disappointed. Have always been a Canon user but sent this one back!!###I wanted something more than my point-and-shoot camera, but I thought I wasn't ready to splurge for a DSLR. So I purchased this camera. When I received it, it was smaller than expected. I tested the camera by taking numerous photos at different settings. Low light pics came out very grainy. The camera didn't capture pics well of my kids - too much of a delay, difficulty reviewing pics after shooting them if setting was not on auto, could not capture fast-moving pics, etc. I can go on and on, but many of the other reviews state this camera's shortcomings. I am returning this camera. I know that I would regret having this camera if I didn't return it, then I would want another camera and have to spend more money. So I splurged and bought the Nikon D3200 and I couldn't be happier. The Nikon D3200 has a guide in the camera that helps you choose the proper settings for the photo you are planning to take, great feature for new users of DSLR cameras!!###This is an excellent camera. I don't like the rechargeable batteries because they don't last long enoughI don't like the lack of a viewfinder. It is too difficult to follow action when taking videos.All that being said, I knew about these features when I bought the camera. It appears that I am old-fashioned. I couldn't find a camera to replace my older Canon S2IS (which had replaceable batteries and a viewfinder) for a reasonable price. Aside from the lack of these two features, I find this camera to be an excellent device which meets my needs very well.!###Am not too impressed with the resulting color. If only I could return it. I liked the previous Canon I lost and its even cheaper than this one.!###amazing eazy one handed clear focus. Now I have memories forever.There's also a video mode and you can have direct access to video recording by pressing the red button on the back of the camera.!###This is a great camera for the price.  I'm never going to be a great photographer and I just wanted a fairly simple camera to take pictures with.  It was very straight forward right out of the box.  It has more features than I will ever use.!###Thx i like the stuff that i just ordered it was perfect with good quality n the service was amazing n it arrived at the exactly time thx a lot!###I am reluctantly sending this camera back to Amazon, as I am nearing the end of the 30-day exchange period.  The camera is really nice but I cannot get the movie mode to play back.  When I follow the instructions in the booklet, nothing happens.  This is my seventh digital camera so it is not like I'm a novice.  I loaded the instruction disc to my computer but when I tried to open the instruction file, I got a message saying it is password protected.  What is the password?  I tried another computer and had the same result.  Since I cannot use the movie mode but the camera mode works well, I'm returning the camera.!###We chose this camera because of the zoom capabilities and the smaller size for traveling.  Small for traveling, clear pictures,!###Nice point and shoot, Light weight and portable amazing zoom, and simple to use. Have always loved Cannon and this is no exception.!###i found this camera easy to use after  i got used to all the settings. good size and great pictures!###Pros: Nice features/settings, Lightweight/Portable, Simple controls/menu, easy to useCons: Dim LCD, Poor image quality, Poor Low-Light Performance, slowI purchased this camera because of the great features and compact size. Performance in terms of picture quality was very disappointing. The LCD was very grainy/pixelated. Good light, low light, stills, motion...nothing looked crisp. Performance seemed sluggish. Hoping that it was the particular camera I had...I returned it and got another. Unfortunately, the image quality was just as poor...the LCD was just as blurry...and it seemed just as slow...so it must be the nature of the product. I have returned it and will invest in something else.On the plus side...I made my purchase through Amazon Prime...they were stellar in handing the returns/refund...could not have asked for more!!###I bought this camera a little over a month ago for my business. I was wanting it to take pictures of products. When I opened the box I was surprised by how petite the unit is. From the pictures it looks like a 'normal' size camera. There are many features that it does not have that I was expecting. I gave the camera to my 13 year old and bought a different brand. It took good enough pictures. Would be a great starter camera for someone just getting into photography or for someone looking for a good point-n-shoot, but you may want to consider something else if you want options.!###I bought this camera in hopes of finding something a little more advanced for low light and action shots than the older Canon pocket digital camera I already had. What I got was a camera that is bigger, although still quite light, with just about the same capabilities. I am by no means a camera expert, but after having a few people look at my settings, etc, in an effort to determine if there were any way to make this camera work for what I was looking for, it was determined that this camera was just not meant for motion or low light. Continous shooting is a joke, if by continous it means that you can take a picture about every 2-3 seconds depending on light and other elements, sure. Definitely not going to catch that came winning goal shot if that is what you are hoping for. Low light, while slightly better then the old digital camera, really isn't anything impressive, either. The zoom function is quite impressive, but keep in mind that you need to have a steady hand to get the full effect. I am returning this camera, and instead am going to try the Nikon Coolpix L820 in hopes of finding a camera in this price range that lives up to the hype they spout regarding action/low light shots.!###I returned this camera, not because there was a defect, but because it was a little too complicated for me.  It is for the more serious point/shoot individual who likes to have more control.  The feel of the camera was sturdy without being bulky.  The zoom was fantastic.  There is no internal image storage, you need an sd card.  The card and battery are under the same cover.  Just make sure you insert the sim card correctly.  There do not interfere with each other and removal was simple as well.  As I said, I liked the camera I just couldn't get the complete benefit out of it.!###It is easy to use and easy to carry.  Very happy with my purchase.  I like the Canon product in general!###I bought this camera to use for travel purposes since I wanted something light and small and if lost, wouldn't break the bank.  So, when we were traveling, it worked well since pretty much all my shots were still shots, scenery, etc.  But, since returning from our trip, I've been using it at home for the kids activities such as when my sons are scootering or recently when we went to the indoor go-kart place.  All the action shots are fuzzy!  I can't seem to capture an action shot.  It's quite possible, even likely, that it's my inexperience but I need to do some research to see how this issue can be resolved.  So, until then, I give it 3-stars.  If I find some way to take good action shots, then I'll upgrade the rating. I used to have the old (pre-digital) Canon Rebel RX camera which was a wonderful camera and which is why I trust Canon.  But, the Powershot might not have been the right choice for me. (But, if anyone has any suggestions on how to take good action shots with this camera, I'd be most appreciative!)!###I love this camera. It has all the features you can ask for out of a digital camera. Plus it makes quality pictures with ease. If you decide to get this camera, I recommend getting a New 32gb Micro Sd Card Sdhc Tf Flash Memory Card 32gb Class 10, New! Usa!. It is good memory card for a camera like this. Aside from that, I give props to canon for making such a great camera.!###I love the photos I get form this camera. The colors are accurate and the pictures are sharp and clear. I have not figures out all of the settings yet but am very pleased with the size/price/quality I've received with this camera. I had a 10 year old power shot before this new power shot! Canon makes good cameras. I read a review from a professional photographer before I selected this camera.!###I like it is very convient  and easy to use .it was very nice if have the camera bag come with it .for that price worth ti to have it ...!###Have had this camera less than 1 week and I LOVE it! Takes excellent outdoor shots and the zoom is awesome! Experimented with the Macro setting and got great pictures the first time. The only draw back is the lack of a &#34;sports&#34; setting and the continuous shooting mode is too slow to be effective if trying to get action shots...but I knew this when I bought the camera so it is no big deal for me. My husband has a Canon EOS Rebel T1i that takes great action shots. I bought this camera for the zoom feature and it is amazing! If I have any complaints at all it is that it writes to the SD card slow. Other than that it is a great camera. Service from Amazon was phenomenal!!###This camera is awesome. Great pics indoors without a flash. Might have to know a bit about photography but it's pretty easy to use.!###Fantastic camera for a beginner, fair price and excelent quality.Love the 30x zoom and all the manual adjustments.Cons: low battery life, no optical display only lcd, that makes it spend even more battery.!###I'm in love with this camera. It is very good with detail on fixed, non moving, objects. What I don't like about this camera is when you try to take a picture of a moving object it blurrs out. I've tried taking a picture of my dog, children, and husband while he was playing sports and each one was good but o only if they were standing still. It blurrs at every little movement. Unless I missed a setting?!###I really love the lights and the response time on getting good job keep it up...and I will keep buying on here..!###A little shaky when you zoom too much, for $300 I am very happy. Battery life is a little lacking for video, but extra battery is like ten bucks!###I really like my camera.  I've taken numerous pictures with it and the only complaint I really have about it is concerning downloading movies.  I've been unable to download movies because of the program I have to use.  The program caused problems on my computer and had to delete it...thus, can't access my movies.  Otherwise I like it.  I'm still learning to use it, but I love that it constantly tracks and makes adjustments on the clarity of the picture.  Great camera if you don't necessarily need the movie function.!###It was so easy to setup; and to download the software and drivers.

I like to carry a camera in my handbag, and of course I am fearful of damage to the monitor since it is completely exposed.  It is worth the money I paid for it.!###This camera is much better than my two Point and Shoot, (Sony and Canon models), which have been retired because of Repair Expenses due to soft lens.There are so many new features and ease of use modes that will come in handy later,  ...!###I paid $199.00, the zoom is really good with the steady hand system, the wide angle is what I really needed it for to get pictures of my work, it increased toe width of the pictures by about one third, I'm needed a basic camera with some adjustments, good video, so far I love it, fits my needs!###I have not used this camera much yet, but tested its abilities and the quality of the pictures.

The pictures are great and the low light really is excellent.  I would recommend this camera for an amateur out there looking for a beginning camera at a decent price.  The only complaint on my side is the fact that the ring around the lens keeps falling off, which I am sure can be fixed with some maintenance.!###ES PERFECTA PARA LO QUE QUERIA, AHORA PODRE TENER LOS RECUERDOS DE MIS SERES QUERIDOS Y EN MEJOR CALIDAD GRACIAS.!###Camera does not have single viewer for picture taking.

We have two children and I wanted great photos of them. This camera does not disappoint. The zoom is incredible. I was able to catch and zoom in on a jumping dolphin in the middle of the ocean and it is so close you can see it's eye.This camera is easy to use and takes the best pictures I've ever seen.!###Can anyone tell me if this camera is big or small?

It was recommended by a friend and I'm very pleased that I purchased.  The price was right and with Amazon Prime the shipping was free.  Make sure you take a look.!###Bought this little camera for a trip to Egypt last month because I was concerned about taking my 5D M3 with all its high-end lenses. Sometimes pro photographers aren't welcome over there with the situation as it is. I managed to take some really great shots with this camera, and the zoom on it is crazy.It' small and light, shoots fairly fast but not like an DSLR; you do have to give it a couple of seconds between shots. I used it only on auto though, so perhaps others settings would cure the problem. Since I didn't have much time to get accustomed to the camera before leaving I just chose auto to be safe. It's a good buy.!###I love this camera! Of all the cameras I have owned in my life,this one is definitely the best. I received it very quickly and got it for a cheaper price than the local Wal-Mart. I have never regretted buying it.!###This is a good and really compact camera.I haven't yet analyzed the quality of photos on a computer, though they look good on the camera.!###This is a great camera.  It has many features.  I could not believe how good the close up photos were.  This camera is as good if not better than higher priced camera.!###I purchased this camera to use on my family's recent cruise to Alaska.  I didn't want an overly complicated camera because I actually wanted to enjoy my vacation and not spend time dealing with camera issues. I am not a very high tech person so I set the camera on auto and just snapped tons of pictures.  I was very happy with the ease of use of the camera and the photos it took. For its price and for my lack of skill I think this camera was a good purchase.!###I get so many compliments on this camera. I post a lot of nature pictures to FB and I get a lot of requests to tell them what kind of camera I have. Easy to use and just very enjoyable.!###Best camera I have ever owned.  The zoom lens is terrific and focusing is even better.  i am an amateur photographer and really enjoy this camera.  It is easy to take award winning photos and download them to my computer and send them via e-mail.  Terrific bang for the buck.!###The best camera I've owned.  Light, easy to use (auto setting) and the photos are excellent.  I also bought  the accessory kit with the  hood attachment shooting flowers.  The close-up shots of my rose garden are magazine-cover quality.  Very please with this purchase.  A lot of camera for the price.!###With a 30x optical zoom and the ability to take manual control of most features or just let the robot drive, this is as capable a non-DSLR camera as I've ever used. Highly recommend. The only thing keeping it from its fifth star is the fact that the big lens requires a fairly big P/S body, at least by today's standards; if you need shirt-pocket handiness, this is not the camera for you.!###So I got my camera for my birthday at the beginning of December and it worked perfectly fine, but recently i havent been using it and now when i picked it up to use it my zoom button is like stuck or like it wont move easily like it use to. Has anybody had any problems like this?!###Got this for christmas and I love it! Photos look almost crystal clear, very simple to use, and the zoom is amazing!###Digital camera for begginers, with some problems with the light filter because you cant use it to take pictures in front of the sun, but its digital zoom can be very usefull.!###Excellent camera, fantastic quality, affordable price and just the right size.... You can never go wrong with canon... It just arrived on time... I would definitely recommend it!!!!###I got this camera for Christmas yesterday and I'm pretty happy so far. The auto focus is pretty good in auto mode and manual mode is relatively easy to use. This is the first camera I have owned personally however my family has owned others. The optical zoom is very good and the digital zoom is pretty good but it takes a couple minutes to focus. I suppose I should give a list of pros and cons so here it is-Pros:-Easy to use-Zoom-Picture Quality When focused-16 megapixels-Flash works wellCons:-There is nothing that is bad about this camera. Its obviously not as good as the EOS cameras but I don't think it makes since to compare it to those being that they are very different. This camera in my opinion is very good.!###I just got this camera for Christmas. I usually am very tech savy and had a question. My other cameras have easy scene modes to choose from. I am trying to find the pet and sports modes on this one. Can anyone tell me how I can find it?!###This is one of the best canon power shot i ever had, i recommend this to all power shot lovers you wont regret it, it takes great pictures and video!###Small, portable, light weight, compact, sleek-looking, attractive-looking and easy to use. Can we ask for more? You don't need to be a wiz on cameras to use it. Pictures come out far better than any regular hand-held digital camera or even the &#34;mighty&#34; iPhone's camera. Highly recommended!!###I chose 5 stars because I love this camera! It is easy to use, compact & light weight. Gives crisp, clear photos with minimum of effort. The AUTO setting is great and I am still learning all the other settings. Super MACRO photos too! The 30 X Optical Zoom and 16 megapixels just fit my needs perfectly. Great for festivals, trips, vacations all the while producing professional quality photos.!###This is an awesome camera with a great feature set.  My daughter is just starting with an interest in photography and rather than invest in a digital SLR right out of the gate we decided to try this one.  After reading a lot of reviews this camera seemed too good to be true, but it does not disappoint.  It has a small form factor for such a feature packed camera.  The screen is HUGE which is nice to review your settings and framing.  The level of &#34;optical&#34; zoom this camera can achieve is ridiculous for it's size.  The controls are very intuitive especially if you have used other Canon cameras.  The video recording and effects are a very nice plus.The biggest factor of course should be &#34;does it take good pictures?&#34;... this takes GREAT pictures and awesome videos.  If you are in the market for something more than a pocket point and shoot then I would highly recommend this camera.!###I am only getting accustomed to this camera. It certainly does all I expected and much much more. The zoom is incredible for a small camera. I think the best way I can describe it is  &#34;a small camera that thinks it is a big one&#34;. It certainly acts like it.!###I'm a terrible photographer and make no bones about it. So of course I look for cameras that can make up for my lack of focusing and &#34;capturing of the moment&#34; skills. This is a Canon, so it comes with a reputation to uphold - and certainly does a great job of doing so. Photos come out beautifully! The instructions could be clearer about how to review photos, but this is a great replacement for a Kodak camera that fried and died after a trip that involved 100-plus degree weather for nearly a week.!###After looking online for weeks, I finally decided to buy this Canon SX500.  This camera had the best features I was looking for (zoom, modes, size, etc.) and it was priced very competitively.  It was shipped fast and safe from the seller and I have no complaints over here... Great seller...!###I am a busy mother & I want to be able to take good quick shots of my kids at all different activities.  The size of the camera is small & compact.  Pictures are clear and the zoom is great.  We took this camera to Disneyworld with us and it took great shots of the outdoor shows using the 30x zoom.  I hardly had a blurry picture from the whole week except for when I did not use flash in low light settings.  The camera has simple features that makes it easy to use.  The only draw back is there is not a view finder but I was aware of that when I purchased the camera.  A great deal for a camera under $200.!###Just got back from family trip to Yellowstone.  My wild animal pics turn out great with the fantastic zoom.  Even the video zoom was great.  Was a little disappointment with the zoom for close-up nature pics.  My flowers and bugs were out of focus.Was worried that I would not remember to lift the flash but all my pics were outside so it wasn't an issue.  It is the perfect size and weight when I don't want to carry around my Rebel xt.!###this is an awesome camera.  I was used to large SLR digital cameras before now I don't know if I will ever go back!!###I am a Realtor and in my business clients like to see nice photos on the web of their home when they look up their listing.  The wide angle lens is great for taking interior shots and the zoom it terrific when needed.  Great camera for taking still shots, not so good for taking action photos such as a sporting event.  Would I buy it again?  Without hesitation!!###quality is great, zoom was better than imagined. excellent for a first time purchase or someone with an interest in cameras!###This cam is amazing really good zoom and tiny very practical excellent choice nice color I can take it everywhere and have very good pictures any moment!###It was just the right camera for our Alaskan cruise.  It has a great zoom and is good for a novice.  Point and shoot  The only complaint is now view finder to look though.  the screen is hard to see in bright light.  All comparable cameras of this type are the same.  It is small and easy to carry.  You trade one think for another.!###Only problem with this camera is no viewfinder. It is very hard to see what you are taking when you are in the sun and cannot see the screen.!###As an amateur, I find this camera to have the image quality and ease of use (with some moments of technical learning perhaps).  This has been our best camera ever!  However, on the down side (minimally, but with some exasperation due to the nature of wild forest creatures) the wonderful camera with nicely rechargeable battery pack incorporates no warning for battery charge need.  It just blanks out in the middle of a video, then shouts 'battery needs charging.'  But such is ever so minor in view of the Canon SX500 16.0 MP camera's wonderful capabilities!  We love it and my husband is an engineer to make matters more explicable.!###I am a novice with cameras, I've had my Sony for 9 years and it has always taken great pictures, but we need a new one. We tried this Canon SX500 and noticed all the normal pictures without zoom were slightly blurry, and I was really making sure it was focused. But when I zoomed in all the way to objects it took a very clear, great picture. Lots of reviews said it was a little blurry and I agree, except with the good zoom. It is very comfortable to hold though. We need better spontaneous pictures so we took this back to Costco.!###This camera has not only met my expectations but have also exceeded them. I haven't yet totally explored the different settings and options available, but I was content with its performance whenever I used it either indoors or outdoors. Will have to explore it further to make use of its full potential.!###I started looking for a camera about a year ago, I must have looked through thousands of them. I wanted a high quality camera for about $200. I started out looking at the Fujifilm Finepix S4200 and I am SO glad I did not buy that camera. The Canon Powershot Sx500 is in my opinion the best, most affordable camera there is. I have been nothing but impressed. The quality of the shots are top notch they are comparable to pictures you would take with a $2000 camera. The camera is so easy to use and the manual does an amazing job of answering any additional questions you have. The large viewing screen is amazing, it really helps you see the details. The zoom is unbeatable, when I was at target yesterday I tested this camera against the Fujifilm Finepix S4200, I zoomed them both in to 30x, and the results were mind-blowing. The picture taken by the Sx500 was crystal clear, not one part of the picture was even a hair blurry. The S4200 on the other hand, was awful. I stood there for 3 minutes trying to focus it and when I finally got it so it was semi blurry, I took the picture, the picture was so blurry I could not even make out the apple symbol. It was terrible. Please save yourself and buy the Canon Powershot Sx500! I AM SO IMPRESSED WITH THIS CAMERA!!###I really love this camera.The size,the prize,everything.the zoom is really amazing and quality of the images leaves you speechless.Also the price is amazing for the quality of the camera!###This camera makes stunning photos!  I was expecting a much heavier product but was pleasantly surprised to find this one really light and fits into my hand nicely.  It isn't a point and shoot as in some of the other smaller versions but the long zoom, the image stabilization and the ease of use is a very good tradeoff.  If you want a quality camera but not so much concerned with dropping it into your pocket or purse then this one will work nicely.!###Me gusta la calidad de la c&aacute;mara. Si cumple mis espectativas. El empaque donde vino esa seguro. El precio es justo lo que buscaba. Se los recomiendo.!###Great camera.  Has a lot of manual SLR features to it that will take some practice to master, but picture quality is stellar.  A great all around camera at a competitive price.!###I should have done more research before I purchased this camera.  It is a real hassle for what I bought it for, taking pictures of jewelry and other small items for my business.I am learning now, after months of trial and error, the little things that I have to do to get the images to turn out just okay. If the lighting isn't perfect you are in for some serious work, not only in the camera itself, but also in editing time once you transfer them to your computer. I am not a photographer by any means and am just now learning how to use some of the other modes outside of auto on these upgraded point and shoots.  I do NOT recommend this camera for a beginner. The Auto function on this camera is a joke, so I would advise those who do not know how to go in and mess with additional settings to buy a different camera, at least to start off with.This does however take great images outside and in nature with little to no hassle or extra effort. The zoom function is especially impressive outside and I was able to get some nice shots of the moon, which I couldn't even come close to doing with my old Camera, though I will say that my old Camera was a CHAMP when it came to taking images for my business.Once I get the extra money I will likely be selling this and buying a different camera for my needs.So, all in all I guess how much you love this camera just depends on what you will be using it for.!###My husband is still getting used to it, but he finds that it is just  what he was wanting in a camera.!###I'm enjoying learning the many features of this beauty. short battery life though. no complain here. reached on time, in good condition and i was pleased!###My son lost my digital camera, so I got this as a replacement. Pretty happy with it. Didn't want to go to an SLR based on the cost alone, but this camera takes beautiful shots!!###I don't know that much about camera so I didn't want to spend that much and after reading reviews, we decided on this camera.  Even though I haven't figure out all the tricks, the camera on auto, takes very nice and clear shots.  We have no problems with it, so far so good.!###Has all the popular features.  Takes great pictures and has a great zoom.Easy to take pictures.  Use some of the advanced feature, you may need the manual.!###I wanted a very easy point and shoot digital camera.  I made a huge mistake previously purchasing (from a chain store) a camera that had so much it just overwhelmed me.  This camera, though, is exactly what I wanted.  Clear, beautiful pictures. Remember, I am an amateur -- and wanted something easy and simple.  I cannot address if it would be appropriate for advanced or experience photographers.!###Good pictures outside but inside is a little lacking, especially without a flash.  Other than that we love it and would recomend it to others.!###This camera probably should get a great, but since I am so camera use dumb I can only give it an okay. I really thought it would be as easy as a point and shoot, but I was wrong. When I learn how to use it I am sure I would be able to rated it higher.!###I have only used this camera a few times, it does take very good pictures in the environment it was used. Possibly down side is the proprietary battery, some of the controls seem awkward, but then it is new.!###Although I like to think I have a good eye for composition of photos, my actual picture taking skill is a bit shady.  This small camera fills in the gaps between what I WANT to do and what I know HOW to do.  Good value for the price.!###It works perfectly, takes magnificent photos.I have taken photos of my friends and family members, thinking of becoming a photographer!!###A little intimidated but learning to use this new camera. Love the zoom! I like the small size as it fits my hand better than a bigger camera.!###great with out going the pro and pro cost. many advance features, including excellent battery recharging and long term shooting inbetween recharging.!###The combination of quality, features, and cost positions this camera at the front of the line.  Only a professional photographer  could want more.!###Best camera I have ever owned. It is compact but packed with features - the auto-features work great if you are a lazy photographer like me.  Takes amazing pictures has reasonable battery life and is simple to operate.  Its great - highly recommended.!###This camera is AWESOME!!!!!  It takes amazing pictures, I am so glad I decided to buy this camera!!  GREAT BUY!!###I love this camera.  It is fairly complex for people like me who know very little about cameras.  Takes great pictures though.!###I love the extra zoom with stabilization. I have taken many great bird pictures that I was never able to take before with this price of camera. Great Camera for the money.!###It has phenomal zoom, good quality, but lacks in motion capturing. But for the price range, I'd say it's the best one out there.!###This camera is worth every cent.the pictures are sharp.Took it out last night and took a shot of the moon you could see the creaters on it.Best Christmas gift ever!!!!!!!!!!###Wonderful camera with 30x zoom that allows for clear pictures from a distance that I would never otherwise capture.  The night time and / or low light photography works very well also.!###I found it smaller than expected,it's light, easy to carry & has good resolutionsuitable for capturing events like parties and family gatherings ,it's semi-professional!###I have always loved cannon  cameras and this is no exception. since I purchased  mine  my recommendation has led to the purchase  of 6 more of the same camera. I purchased one for my grandson, my son in law bought his own, my friend purchased one for them selves and one for their daughter and two friends at work purchased it also. just waiting for my check from cannon.!###I am very happy with it. Good size (small) and good zoom, that was what I was looking for. I recomend it.!###I sent this camera back.  I have always had Canon cameras, and was relying on the brand's reputation.  I wanted to upgrade from a basic, pocket size point and shoot, as I use the camera primarily to take product photographs indoors.  I found the photos to be grainy when set on auto-mode.  I've always used a viewfinder, but decided to give this camera a chance.  The flash was just too bright when I had to use it, and the photos were washed out.  I didn't find the camera user-friendly.  When I went to take action shots, since there is a big lag time while posting, I wasn't able to capture the exact photo shots I wanted.  While it was in the price point I was looking to spend, I didn't want to waste my money on a camera I felt I would ultimately be unhappy with.  On the recommendation of a professional photographer who did some further research for me, I purchased the Fujifilm FinePix S8400W 16.2 MP Digital Camera instead.!###Great affordable point and shoot, also capable of some totally awesome macros......exceptioal image  stabilization. Not fast, or good for action shots. Awesome ZOOM!!###I love my camera! It is easy to use and so light to carry. My pictures are beautiful and bright!!###We are very happy that we have stepped up to this camera from our Canon PowerShot SD850 IS Digital ELPH, which was really nice when traveling.  It fit in our pockets as well as worked wonderfully on trips.  Extra memory cards allowed us to take all the photos we wanted.  But, we found it inadequate for either long distance or quite near objects.So we tried this one.  Being frequent photographers but infrequent travelers we felt it was enough.  Since we have begun taking photos of birds both near and afar, we stepped up to the SX500.  It is still simple enough for us to handle.  It does not require frequent lens changes.  A few filters, once in a while might yet prove useful, some day.This works very well for us.We suggest you take a look into purchasing this camera.!###I am not an professional when it comes to taking pictures, I just love to take picterus when i go on vacation or when i go on  a trip. But one of my friends is an professional photograhper and he really likes to play with it, since it is very small and it has alot of functions so yes if you are an amature photographer and want to take it to the next level this will be the one. also the movies you mke with this camera are amazing!!###I started out with a canon digital camera about 10 yrs ago, After several years it broke, I switched to another brand of camera, and it was awful, I bought this SX500, so far in 3 weeks I am very happy with it.!###It was a gift for my 13 yearold daughter who wants to experiment with photography. She loved it. Graet choice!###I have only had this camera for a short time. The zoom on this is very good! The flash is very bright. Operation for the most part is simple, with the exception of trying to figure out how to take a picture of a moving subject. When trying to take a picture of my twin babies, one will move slightly and the picture will be blurred. I'm sure there is a setting for this, but I have not gotten there. Pictures of still objects are coming out crystal clear. All in all I am very happy with it!!###It has great auto features and lots of options for taking photos.  The 30x lens provides many photo opportunities. Great price.!###My teenage son loves it.  Takes great pictures and is compact enough for him to carry on all his camping trips.  Has taken really clear pictures in all different settings.!###Got it for a gift for my wife for christmas and she loved it, easy to use and zoom is great!###Gave as a gift. it is liked very much. It is easy to use. Photos look great, gives you many options to shoot.!###I'm not a photo bug , like most everyone, I just wanted a camera with a good stabilized zoomer. I got it here! Love all the features too. Thanks Canon.!###It is the right camera for us, takes great shots and is just perfect. We were going to get a more expensive camera but decided on this one and are very happy. Also Cannon is the best.!###I really like this camera.  I have a similar Canon - the S95.  It is virtually the same camera.  The zoom & the instant movie function make this one better.  I found I was using the zoom more then I wanted.  This lead to the battery not lasting as long.  A good camera, good lens with a great zoom plus other great features.  For me it was a tough one to return.  It would do well but I decided to return it, save up & get a full SLR at some point.!###This camera it's excellent. It takes good pictures and videos. The size is perfect. The price even better. I am very happy with this camera.!###Has produced excellent pictures. Fairly light for a camera with many of its capabilities. Good flexibility Still getting accustomed to its features though.!###I don't EVER leave home without it.  ?his is the easiest camera to operate I have ever had producing the best quality photos ever.  Spend just a few minutes learning about your SX500  and let the camera do the work.  It's not for the professional wedding or portrait photographer - however you can shoot totally manually if you choose.  But if you just want great photos, it's for you!!###I love this camera so much.  I was so amazed at the quality of the pictures that I took with this camera.  It has a zoom, has a rechargeable battery and takes excellent pictures.  I recommend this camera to others.!###I very much liked this purchase.  I with pleasure use and I recommend to each person to get this thing.!###Bought this camera for casual photography for my family back in india.It's easy to use and the quality of photos is very good.It was a bargain for $200.!###After our trip to Alaska,my wife & I agreed we needed a better camera. While in Alaska we met a couple that had this model , I asked him about it, he was kind enough to take the time to show me all the features , he was especially pleased with 30x wide angle, for the scenery and wildlife.Upon our return I went to Amazon to look for this model and read the reviews, the reviews seemed positive, so we bought it.We've only had it a short time, but so far,WOW!!!It has a lot of features that we haven't mastered yet, but we'll eventually figure it out.We are 100% satisfied, we also bought the 2 pack replacement battery & the 16 GB memory card.I'm not a camera expert, but for us this was a lot of camera for not a lot of $$$$!###i love this camera so much i took it to see taylor swift and every picture came out perfect i could not ask for a better camera!###This camera has a great zoom and takes wonderful pictures.  It is very small and lightweight, I highly recommend it.!###The PowerShot SX500 is an easy to use camera with many high-end features.  The price is greatly reduced, probably because it is being discontinued, but that did not deter me purchasing it.  I had tried one out at a local store, and liked the features, and way it felt.  The price at the store, and several others,  was more than on Amazon.  I was pleased to find this high quality camera on Amazon for such a low price.  The camera was received within a week of placing the order.!###One of the best purchases I've made on amazon. I'm in love with my camera. I arrive on time and well wrapped to not suffer any kind of scratch. Definitely would recommend to those who started this wonderful world of photography. I am currently in the process of learning to use it to exploit all that has!###Great clarity, lightweight for all-day touring.  easy transfer of pics to computer.  Video with stabilizing feature works well and audio is clear. The only thing that is negative is while recording a music group in a nightclub the audio clipped out and gave static on high tones.!###I have two 35 mm cameras so I like Canon.  This one is easy to use, but instruction book is hard to use.!###I wanted a good camera for my Alaska trip.I wanted to be able to video as well as take pictures.This did it beautifully.The zoom is great and I have wonderful pics.Glad I made this purchase!###Easy to operate and takes sharp beautiful photos.  Love the zoom capabilities, as the clarity remains even when bringing objects super close.  Lightweight enough to bring everywhere.!###I have been a little disappointed with this camera. Still trying to figure out how to use to the maximum. I do love the battery that is rechargeable. I just took many pictures at my grandson's college graduation so it got great use.!###Have used the camera for one outing to the mountains.  Performance was as expected for a compact camera.  Purchased the camera online at Amazon and was definitely a good deal.!###I just love this camera! Best one I've had for that price! Easy to use, great definition, battery is working great, etc.!###I am sitll playing with it but it is a nice camera for the price. I had a  Nicon which was similar but harder to use and not thee same cool fetures.!###Excelent shoot, the zoom is so potent. We think that was bigger, but size is perfect. Good product, I love it!###I wanted a camera to take pictures of birds through my back sliding door.  It works very well for that purpose. The magnification and stabilization or excellent.  Indoors with low lighting it is not the best.  maybe I just have not figured it out yet.  Moving objects prove to be difficult.!###I didn't expect the quality of standard to be this high its like having three cameras in one a digital camera, a 35mm camera and a camcorder only one thing is missing is a port to use an adapter if you didn't want to use your battery but otherwise I am very happy!###I could not be happier with my purchase.

When I received the box I was a little surprised at how small it was. I was hoping it was a little bigger. Nothing like a 7D or 5DMII. It is light weight and a decent camera for the price with great optical zoom, IS, good MP and fun features like fish-eye. Mom is happy, that's all that counts. :)!###Really nice little camera.Easy to use ,Fits nice in your hand.I am a senior so for me the placing of the controls are important to me,I really like this camera!###The product is what I expected, corresponds to the specifications, works well, has a good price and is recommendable for purchase!###I bought this camera because my daughter-in-law has one like it.

We are a Media department who did not possess a decent camera for pictures... We have many professional camcorders for footage as we do morning broadcasts and a magazine show.  I was blown away with the capability of this camera.  It takes great pictures with a terrific zoom, and the video quality almost matches the professional video cameras we have...I will be ordering four more for the next school year.!###This is first time I buy Canon camera.It is good in quality as the fair amount of payment.If you want to buy something that are 'professional' then buy the expensive cameras, please.I was tired of seeing whinny whining babies in reviews saying how this camera is not good,and so far, I think this camera is not that bad. The prices is fair and the qualities of images I getting from this camera, is WAY better than iPhone cameras, so I am okay with.I give 5/5 stars for this. The packing, it was as safe that they put air cushions around my camera, so there was NONE of damages at all when it arrived. I was actually feeling really safe to see that. It was great deal, and I am fully satisfied. This is first time I am using amazon and buy a camera for myself. I think I was glad to use amazon and buy a camera from this seller. Thank you.!###I shoot with the Canon Rebel XT and the Canon EOS 7D. I bought this camera for my niece, thinking it would be a great little "starter" camera for a child.While that is true, it has proven to just be a great camera all around. It has all the automatic functions, as well as full manual and ability to change ISO's, and shoots great HD video. It does not drain the battery any more than what I would expect as normal. I would recommend this product. While I did not purchase it on Amazon or from this specific seller, I just thought I would reiew the camera. The only con I have noticed is I am unable to attach a UV filter on the lens to protect it. I am a Canon user and would have expected a company such as Canon to have not over looked this quality. Still, it is a great purchase.!###I love my new camera. I can zoom in subjects when taking pictures. I love it. It is fairly compact to carry.!###Es una camara muy buena con muy buen zoom un buen price comoda para los viajes muy recomendables o o!###Great camera! Great price. Many, many features. Easy to use. Would be great for anyone who loves taking pictures in multiple settings. Lots of extras, not really for a beginner. Would be a great in between camera to the professional ones.!###this is a great camera for the price. it is small but has a great zoom and is great for mama's purse.!###I bought this camera looking for something a little more advanced than my Samsung point and shoot camera.  I used my Samsung at a concert and the pictures came out okay.  The zoom feature is only 6x so I couldn't take the best pictures but it still worked.  I went to another concert, same place and same seats, and the pictures came out 10 times better than my others.  What i was thrilled about was the video.  I took a small video of about 15 seconds and it came out incredible.  The sound quality is also fantastic.  We were sitting by the speakers and you can barely hear a crackle.Overall if you're looking for an upgrade over a cheap camera, I would recommend this camera to anyone.!###This camera has an astoundingly long telephoto lens, good image stabilization, great price, compact size, light weight and abundant pixels. This makes for at least a fabulous vacation camera, and a bit more.  The negatives include what you have to expect: the trade offs for size and price necessitate a slow (small aperature) lens.  This means the flash range is limited, and the automatic controls tend to select a higher ASA.  I haven't figured out how to lock the ASA at 100 or 200.  Except in bright sunlight, a tripod is essential at the longer focal lengths.  Shutting off the image stabilization is recommended by the manufacturer when using a tripod.  There is no remote shutter release, so to avoid camera shake using a tripod, the self-timer is recommended.  This, coupled withe the shutter delay in normal operation means some difficulty in composing shots with moving objects.That said, overall it is a great camera at a great price.!###this camera is great! it's smaller than i expected, but it's actually been a good thing for me. the screen is large. the focus on the screen is not always what you get with the real picture. it's so much better. it's easy to use and i like the application that gives you hints and tips as to how to focus, if to use the flash, etc. i love using this camera!!###I got this camera hoping to improve my close up jewelry photos, but alas, it doesn't seem to have the one feature I wanted-macro zoom.  Or maybe I just haven't found the macro zoom-does anyone know?  It gets very close for macro shots, but the lens casts a shadow on the jewelry. It seems like it will be a great camera for other uses, and we got it for free with some credit card points, so I really can't complain.!###The camera took a while to get used to.  It takes a little longer then I expected to focus and the pictures tended to be dark in the AUTO mode.  Much better in the LIVE mode.  Also the video did not always work.  It refused to start a few times.  Those are the negatives.  I really enjoyed the wider angle lens and the 30X zoom was great.  Took about 1200 pictures on a recent trip to Russia and was not disappointed in the number of high quality pictures the camera took both indoors, without a flash, and outside.  Flash photography was forbidden in many of the historic sites.  Battery life was average about 75 pictures.  All in all the camera was worth the price.!###I can't compare this with other camera's but for the paid money, it offer excellent performance!Pics are crispy and nice.i can count the hair on my mustache from the pic i took in sunlight. Pics are good taken at maximum zoom.!###Poor quality picturesNot automatic flashLong time waiting to take one picture after anotherNot good focusing at night!###Small enough to carry anyway, but functional enough to take incredible pictures.... has a great zoom, a large enough screen, and very easy to navigate!###There was nothing wrong with the camera.  I returned it because it was bigger than I thought it would be.  I was looking for a sophisticated camera small enough to fit in my pocket.!###I have had this camera for a week now.  It was to upgrade my Canon IS3000 with a mere 5x zoom.  I also own a Sony camcorder with 70x zoom.  So far what ever I seem to do with the Canon SX 500 it is running circles around my Sony Camcorder.  My conclution now is that Sony does NOT make very good cameras.  The ZOOM on the SX 500 is absolutely fantastic.  Nice and smooth both in Still and Movie mode and the clarity is absolutely fantastic at 30x.  The only distortion really might be from my jumping up and down because the view is so good, because my Sony doesnt even come close to looking this good at ANY ZOOM LENGTH.... lol..  still pictures are crisp and a joy to look at on this sharp three inch screen.  Its easy to use but the only thing is make sure when your in the AUTO MODE the tracking automatically turns on... and the green box goes all over the screen to look for something to shoot at and while it does that it shuffles through all the mode choices... at first I thought it was a defect until I realized I HAD TO SET THE BOX AT THE AREA I WANTED TO SHOOT AT.... and you do that by pushing the top arrow button to select the shot...but I like the program mode the best... lets see... whats bad about it... well it is a lil bulky not bad, but requires a case.  And the neck strap is lame, it gets in the way of all your hands and the screen... I took it off am going to buy a hand strap here at Amazon and I DONT LIKE LENS COVERS, I like the ones that close automatically, but oh well...  I suggest buying an extra battery with maybe a car charger, because this camera because of its technology is going to use up more battery life probley than just the 190 pictures a charge they say you can get with this.  Remember they dont take in to account your viewing time and sometimes that can be extensive.!###I bought this camera for the regular use of photography. When I got it I was really excited, but I didn't really realize how small it was. I was thinking this camera was a lot bigger. Though it's a great camera. Once you get used to it. It's really fun to use and it's a great indoors and outdoors camera. I would recommend getting lighting if you're taking pictures inside a house. Just to lighten the room up, but outside it was completely fine. I wouldn't say this is the best beginner camera just because of how many functions it has which is great, but you gotta know what you're doing.This camera was a great price for the buy. Though I see the price of the Camera has went up in price still a good buy in my opinion.!###This was my first time ordering with Amazon and both the Amazon experience and the camera have been beyond my expectations. The reviews gave me ample warning 're: Sutter speed so I was prepared. The zoom takes time to adjust your eyes then the shots can be surprising. My favorite feature is the design of the camera giving a nice grip and feel of the more expensive camera yet the ease of carrying a "point & shoot"  still new to me, but it was nice to buy something & have it & the vendor exceed expectations.!###this camerahas a stablazation problem. When zooming it remains out of focus for a long time. This did not allow me to take good photos of animals on my recent trip to Africa. The 30x zoom was the reason I bought the camera.!###Good camera, but the indoor pictures are not too impressive. I bought it to take with me to hawaii and I'm sure we will be outside most of the time. I love the zoom. Very clear pictures.!###My only issue is about the price drop just after I purchased the Camera....This Camera does the trick, a great Product.!###I just love this camera! Best one I've had for that price. Great zoom and picture quality for a compact...!!###You can't beat this camera for the price. Would highly recommend it. Takes beautiful photos,the zoom is outstanding and the 720p video is very good.!###The zoom is simply awesome. Exactly as it was described. Not very great in low light situations, but the performance outside and the zoom, more than make it worth every dollar it costs.!###When I ordered this camera, I am not sure that this is a right one for me. Now, I love it and it is so easy to operate and the picture comes out very nice and clear.  I think that it is a good choice for the price.  I am highly recommended this camera for everyone.!###I love the compact size of the camera.  I also like having the ability to choose the AUTO feature (point-and-shoot), or use the mode control knob to tweak the exposure due to challenging light conditions.  As far as I can tell, photo quality is great.  I'm admittedly an layman when it comes to photography; but for my purposes, the camera fits the bill perfectly.  The main reason I bought this camera was because of price, the Canon name, and the 30X Zoom lens.  So far, I haven't been disappointed with the purchase.!###This camera is great! It wasn't as good as I wanted it at my graduation but I blame the lighting not the camera. Works great!!! Excellent pictures too.!###I like this camera, but I don't love it. It has some nice features like the 30X zoom. I find it's light weight, which most people would probably like, to be a bit of a problem for me. I am used to a Canon SX 100 IS with a metal body. The 500 is harder to hold steady, I think because of it's smaller size and lighter weight. It takes good pictures.!###This thing is great! Small enough to carry around with me, but powerful enough to give me control of my shots. I really am surprised at its small size. I just wanted it to be able to throw in my backpack and go out to take pics in New York City so it will do the job nicely!###Super great camera! I wanted a nice quality camera that wasn't too complicated to use. This camera takes great shots, quick and very easy to use. Definitely recommend it if you're looking for a simple good quality camera.!###This digital camera is so good for this price, because you can control a lot of functions.You have the manual mode, where you control all your camera, focus and more.This camera zoom is very very good, 30x zoom.You can take a picture of a thing that far far from you...like 100 meters, with all details.No problems with shipment.!###It's not awesome but it worth money...It's better than any other cameras in this category...Picture quality is not great...but worth money!###I bought this camera to take on safari in Tanzania. I was so happy with how easy this camera is to work and I took some amazing photos with it.!###This camera takes excellent pictures even in auto mode. The zoom is amazing! It is a little smaller than I thought it would be. The screen is still huge though, bigger than the other larger Canon I have.!###The product arrived on good time, and I love this camera. It takes amazing shots. It does take some time to adjust from the air conditioning inside to the outside heat, but I'm hoping the camera bag I purchased is very helpful.!###The camera is amazing. The zoom is fantastic, actually goes up to 120x, thought it was only 60x when i bought it. specs didnt say that. my only recommendation is if you plan on zooming at a distance a lot, buy a stand for the camera, very hard to keep your hand still at 30x  or higher.!###My camera takes the most beautiful pictures and easy to use.. I have not learned all the different settings yet it just sets itself to what I am taking pictures of....!###I love my Canon. The pictures are awesome and once you get used to the smaller size, the light weight is an added bonus. Only thing taking some getting used to is when taking a picture with flash it sometimes pauses. Might just be some user error.!###I chose this camera because of the power zoom. I like that it is small and easy to handle. I took this camera on a recent cruise, and I was very pleased with the photos. I am still learning about it, but I would recommend this camera to anyone.!###My only complaint is that the disk which contains the fine tuning needed to make photos of quality isn't compatible with my 0S10.5.8. Leaves me with half the functionality I'd have with that software. I ordered filters, case, 32G memory card, charger, lens adapter to go with it, so I intended to make use of functions!!###Very good buy at the price I pay .Nice digital zoom and very confortable size of the camera body. I have not used very much at this time but for me is very good!###Great point and shoot camera and good for beginner photography. I am very happy and would recommend this camera to friends.!###I bought this camera for my trip to Mt. Kilimanjaro. I was looking for a good camera that was not as big and bulky as a professional camera but would still take great pictures! THIS IS IT!!! Awesome zoom and pictures.!###The camera is cute and light but the photo quality is really poor, the manual flash is cumbersome to use.!###It is a good camera for the price it is. I haven't had a problem with it at all. The only thing that I could see improvement in is capturing pictures of cities at night from afar.!###I've had this camera for over 9 months and I love it. The lens is amazing and the zoom is powerful. Definitely a good buy.!###I read some mixed reviews before buying this camera. I am glad I did I thought it was wonderful. For an amatuer photographer it is a dream great for our vacation and photos printed nicely on the 8X10. Sad some reviews did not appreciate it and seemed to compare it to professional grade camera's. It takes beautiful photos and video.!###I use this camera for video and still pics.  I've not had any problems.  Very easy to use and easy for others to use.  No more of you not being in any pics because no one else can use your camera.!###This is a great camera,have been waiting for a good buy,I found it!I will recommend to others,arrived on time,thank you.!###My original intent was to buy a camera to photograph my jewelry. I didn't want the complication of a SLR camera, but still wanted something that I could expand on as I get better at Photography. The &#34;Manual Feature&#34; takes great pictures, both close up and far away. The Zoom on this camera is the best feature. Haven't tried the video yet, but I'm prepared to be amazed.!###I bought this camera before I went on vacation because I just wanted better pictures than my cell phone offered. It is compact, yet take really good pictures and videos. I now am taking everywhere with me. The instructions are easy to follow, and it takes really great pictures under all kinds of conditions. I am especially impressed with the video quality. The battery does wear down pretty fast (especially in video mode) so if you are using it multiple days in a row it is a good idea to charge the battery overnight.!###I got this camera so I wouldn't have to use my ancient one on a vacation oversees. I was ecstatic with the picture quality (I'm an interior designer, so I know picture quality) and the ease of use. For your standard picture, it's incredible. But then (later than I would have liked), I found out that there are TONS of special settings/effects/options with it, and now I feel like I have much to learn about this little thing. I honestly don't know why the price is so great for this piece of equipment - it's worth way more. It does just about everything any fancier camera would do. The zoom is even higher than any other camera of it's type that I've seen. I'd recommend this to anyone.!###I bought this camera to replace a Canon S2 IS that wore out after 7 years and thousands of pictures.  The SX500 IS comes at a much lower price than did the S2 IS, and has the capacity to take much larger photos.  The 30X zoom is wonderful; it did take me a while to learn how to hold the camera still when using the zoom at close to its maximum.  Battery, which is included, is rechargeable, and needs to be recharged frequently.  An SD memory card is not included and must be bought separately; fortunately, high-capacity memory cards are quite inexpensive..!###This Camera really takes some pics and easy my 12 yr old takes good pics the catch is it will zoom whay out and the further you get the harder it is to hold still but for the price  and quality its worth it all day long...!###I wanted to have a camera that was easy to use, and to take on a vacation out west.I chose this camera because of a friends recomendation. I have been practicingso I will be ready for my vacation. Very pleased with all my pictures.!###I still have lots to learn with this camera and I need to watch the informational DVD, but I took this camera to Florida for vacation and the outdoor pictures are phenomenal!  I posted a picture of my grandson jumping in a pool and even the water splashes were so clear.  So, so far I love it!!!###I still did not play with all the features available but I used the auto focus & have no complaints so far!###Bought this to replace tired powershot 2 IS. Much lighter in weight and just as easy to use!  Though I did have a bit of a time getting used to shooting with the screen instead of the eyepiece, it didn't take long!  30x Zoom and wide angle are a plus!  Love this camera!!###So far I really like this camera,  I am still learning how to use it but it takes great quality pictures.!###This is the best camera I have owned.  I especially like the quick shutter speed.  I would certainly recommend this camera. Thanks!!###There is a delay after the shot is snapped, such that many shots are not what I wanted.And  I can't figure out how to take action shots, a lot of the shots are blurry.The manual doesn't seem to have the answers.!###This is an amazing camera! It is great for those who want a nicer camera, but cannot or do not want to spend a ton of money.!###I love it! This camera is awesome ! Love it :) super amazing the recording the HD filming EVERYTHING! It was wonder ful!###birthday present for my daughter, she loves it!!! not to big or heavy, perfect size for traveling. she totally loves it!###so far I have no complaints .

It has a GREAT zoom and the pictures are really clear.  It feels sturdy and so far has held up quite nicely.!###Bought it for my use, but my once my young adult kids borrowed it, they couldn't stop using it.  Loved by everyone in the family.Easy to use and awesome pictures!!###Better than most point & shoot cameras; easier to deal with than a DSLR. Good value.  SoMe of the controls can be a little unintuitive, but overall, it's easy to use.!###This was a gift to my Son and this camera takes awesome pictures! The Wide lens is a plus. Zoom works great! Easy to use. Would recommend!###Its easy to use, the zoom is more than I expected. I already showed it to a person who had a smaller Canon and she loved it and was going to order one when she got home.!###I bought this camera to take on plane flights...much smaller than its "big brother," the Rebel T3.  It's a good camera, only cons are time in between shots and the LCD screen...in bright light you simply CAN'T see what you're shooting.!###This camera is compact, simple, fully compatible with my expectations. great resolution, is not heavy and for beginners like me, a great purchase.!###I bought this camera for over a year. I have recently upgraded to a DSLR but this is a perfect camera for those who want to get started on photography. Very light weight. it is a Point and Shoot Camera.!###The zoom takes sharp pictures as does the wide angle. It's a little bulky but worth the effort to carry it around. Glad I bought it!!###tends to be a little unforgiving when subjects move. occassionaly it cannot get a clear shot of the subject. Love it on a tri-pod!###Takes great shots, especially for someone who is looking for a fun camera that is not too techy. Great zoom tooo!!!###So far my girlfriend loves it, she took a digital photo glass in school and says it's fantastic, obviously not as good as slr but defiantly worth the price!!!###This is a great camera.  The zoom is perfect for far away zooming.  Takes beautiful pictures.  I recommend this camera!###I wanted a digital camera that was easy to use, compact and easy to carry.this camera was all that I wanted.!###Excelent quality and price. Definitely the best election, maybe in other opportunity I will come back to buy. Thank you!###Excellent Camera. Practical, comfortable, easy to use and carry. Very good optical zoom. Only one thing is negative, during video recording, the image many times turns a little opaque for a seconds, and as a result the video is not 100% sharp.!###The camera was all that I expected and more. This is my second Canon and I love it. I will be buying an extra rechargeable battery.!###Works good in Automatic mode..  Included documentation insufficient.  Too many pages to print from the files..  No computer available when using SX500 IS camera and need help.  Included camera control and editing software questionable.!###I read many of the reviews and although they were mixed I think it depends on personal needs and expectations. I bought this to replace my Canon 260 which I lost.I am just getting started with it but so far it is what I expected. Some complained about the size but it was described clearly and was the size I was looking for.!###I love my new camera!  When I zoom in on a wave cresting at the beach or on a bird sitting way over there on that branch, I get a fairly clear, sharp picture that guides my paintings.  The view window is huge and it's fun to show off details of my work to inquisitors.!###Bought it on my hollydays and didn't disappointed me!. Really cool pictures! nice colors, Manual function and HD recording videos functions do the difference!. It really worth its value!.!###Great camera for the price.  It is not so good in low light areas but can be dealt with.  Wish there was book for dummies to learn what it all does.  The manual is pretty basic and does not give the camera the justice it deserves.  The zoom is def a plus and makes up for the low light not being as well.!###I spent $199.99 along with free shipping and no tax. Its definetely worth more than i spent on it! I feel bad for only paying that much! everything about it i LOVE!!###This is easy to use, takes great photos and is small enough to not be a problem.  So far, I have no complaints.!###Great camera for the price, my wife loves it. I picked this up as a replacement for her Fugi camera which stopped working.

It's a simple point and shoot camera with a big lens. Perfect for everyday use, however best to go with an SLR if you want more features, options, and higher grade photos.!###Fell in love with this camera and very easy to use. The picture quality is outstanding. Kind of long in the tooth with shaky hands and the camera compensates for that.!###Does every thing my any other Canon will do !! Has a screen on back to see what you are going to photo !! The IS works perfectly with shaky hands like mine !!!!###It's great all around. Low light is okay, better than Kodak, but still not as good as dslr cameras, however I'm very happy with this camera.!###Bought this for my fiance and he adores it its a great camera and he uses it all the time!###Awesome camera, awesome pictures at an awesome price point!

Having a tough go of figuring out settings to become better at taking photos.!###Great Price for a great camera! Extremely well priced in regards to other cameras of this caliber!! Came with a bunch of accessories!!###My passion is waterfalls and the pictures and videos i have taken with this camera have been of the highest quality.

It is so easy to use and takes wonderful clear pictures.I would recommend this camera to anyone that wants to make sure they have good quality pictures and easy to use.!###I found the camera very easy to use. It took very sharp pictures and the video reproduced the audio quality very well. My only complaint was that it was a bit bulky. The lens doesn't retract when not in use, so you can't just drop it in your pocket. It's not heavy, so it wasn't too burdensome with the strap around your neck.!###I am still learning about all the functions of the camera but I am loving the high quality pictures.  I have mostly been using the auto function and find that it suits my needs.!###I have never been a camera person until I purchased this camera. It is a good size to take places so you never miss a shot. It has a clear picture and an amazing zoom. It's not hard to figure out how to use it and once you do you will never want to stop. Definitely worth the price. Get the starter kit to go with it and you are set!!###This camera is awesome. It is amazingly simple to use, takes great pictures and is very easy to hold. The zoom on the camera is incredible to say the least. It go to 30x mech zoom and then digital all the way to 120x. I was taking pictures, i just couldn't with my (comparable in features) old Nikon camera.

!###The product itself is fantastic and my stars are based on the product being a great deal and a great device.But for anyone thinking of buying from Amazon, be warned. I purchased one of these for someone on her birthday and it was listed as new.  Amazon seems to only sell iPad minis from third party sellers, not from Amazon.com itself, meaning another company gets the iPads from any source they want, sends them to Amazon, and Amazon ships them. One of these sellers listed an iPad mini slightly above retail price, but cheaper than all of the other iPad minis on Amazon. In fact, when I searched for iPad mini, it was the seller and product page the site automatically directed me to. The page indicated it as new, and sold it to me via Amazon.  When my friend got her iPad mini, it looked new, was packaged and sealed like new, but when she turned it on, it was tied to someone else's icloud account. I called apple and gave them the serial number. Sure enough, the item was used, only had about 60 days left in the warranty (instead of 90) and was registered through Apple to a different customer.  If I wanted a used iPad Mini, I would have paid less. Much less.I even emailed the user who had previously owned it (since her email address via iCloud was showing up when my friend tried to access the app store. I emailed the previous user just to make sure it wasn't a stolen product. She explained that she had purchased it a few weeks back from At&T, not from Amazon. She wanted a wifi + 3g version, not just wifi, so she returned it and somehow, the third party seller got their hands on it and sold it to me as new.In the defense of of the third party seller, once I got their phone number from Amazon and called them (most seller numbers are not on Amazon, you have to call and request a phone number), they provided a scary explanation: They explained that there are problems with Amazon's FBA system (fulfillment). Sometimes, iPads are returned with nothing but index cards in the box and Amazon thinks there is an iPad inside. Sometimes, products mingle, and so another seller's used iPads might be with a different seller's new iPads. They explained that they have a very legitimate source of iPads and have been selling iPads for years and that this is a rare occurrence, although it has happened before. I have no way of verifying any of this, so I can't blame Amazon or the seller. All I can say is that for such a large purchase, and one that is a gift, you are better off buying from a major retail store that doesn't sell used items at all (or buying from Amazon when it is shipped and sold and fulfilled by Amazon).  Right now, this product is actually on sale at Walmart.Amazon refunded me but now my friend has to return her birthday gift. I recommend buying from someone other than Amazon. For this particular product, it's probably the cheaper route to do that anyway. If you do buy from Amazon, call Apple with your Serial Number and verify it is a new, unregistered product with a full 90 day warranty. Don't get scammed.!###Conceived from its sleek, glossy 10" counterpart, the new iPad Mini boasts one gigantic new trait over the full-sized iPad: the ability to hold it in one hand. This almost revolutionary twist on the device that sparked a frenzy in the tablet world has finally brought joy to those that have held out hope of such higher portability in an iPad for so long. But does the iPad Mini live up to the hype?  Absolutely.Turns out, the iPad mini is indeed more than simply a shrunk-down iPad, though there may be an argument for it actually resembling something more along the lines of a blown-up iPod touch. In any case, the big question: is the iPad mini right for you? I'll endeavor to answer that for you here by taking you hands-on with the new model, plus I'll share from my past few years of iPad ownership experience altogether, especially for those who haven't yet had an iPad to call their own.Plus, in hopes of making this the most helpful iPad mini review on Amazon, I'll also reveal a treasure trove of info on how you can legitimately download tons of quality apps and games for free!For those interested, I've also compiled two iPad listmania lists:Must-Have iPad Accessories: http://www.amazon.com/lm/R1M3AJDBR2BCA7?tag=1pad-20&ie=UTF8iPad vs. Other Tablets: http://www.amazon.com/lm/R3QLZ307253XU6?tag=1pad-20&ie=UTF8My reviews tend to run long, so I've organized information by section, with headings, to help you quickly locate any specific info you're after. For example, see the heading "Downloading Apps and Games" for the info on obtaining free apps and games!First, let's compare hardware specs between iPad mini and iPad, and what each means for you:+ Device: iPad mini vs. iPad (4th gen)+ Weight: 0.68 lbs vs. 1.44 lbs -- over twice as light as the iPad+ Thickness: 0.28" (7.2mm) vs. 0.37" (9.4mm) -- thin as an iPod touch+ Display: 163 vs. 264 pixels per inch -- less-crisp text, but equally long life for a smaller battery+ Resolution: 1024 x 768 vs. 2048 x 1536 -- half as many pixels as the current iPad, but still sharper than an iPad 2+ Battery: 10 hours (16.3 Wh) vs. 10 hours (45 Wh) -- smaller, lighter battery lasts just as long as the iPad+ Processor: A5 (dual core) vs. A6X (dual core with quad core graphics) -- same as the new iPod touch, but not quite as powerful as the latest iPad, yet it doesn't need to be because the iPad mini display totes a quarter as many pixels!+ Price: The iPad mini has a price tag that is indeed much more attractive than the 10" iPad. It's actually closer to that of the iPod touch.===== First Impression =====At first sight, there's a feeling of novelty to the iPad Mini, especially if you've used a 10" iPad or tablet. The more you use it, however, the more you realize that this is the size an iPad was meant to be: perfectly portable. The 10" iPad is so bulky and heavy in comparison, and I felt uncomfortable, embarrassed and awkward taking it with me and using it places, especially waiting in line. Not so with the iPad mini! It's super light, more than half the weight of the 10" iPad, and its sleek rounded edges are much more comfortable for carrying than the sharply-tapered edges of the iPad.My initial reaction to the unveiling of the iPad mini was one of slight disappointment, mainly because it was closer to 8" than to the desired 7" of other tablets in its class. Why would Apple bother bringing a smaller iPad to market that's still not quite as small as some of the other 7" tablets floating around? Ah, but I was wrong.Until I held it in my own hand, I failed to realize that Apple had made better use of the iPad mini's size than most 7" tablets do. What matters in a 7" tablet class isn't the screen size but the actual device size. The iPad mini is 3mm shorter and 7mm wider than the 7" Kindle Fire HD, yet it touts nearly an inch more of physical screen size.===== Interaction Experience =====Naturally, the iPad mini shares the iPad's same phenomenal multi-touch interface that is undisputedly second to none. Android tablets and other devices may tout "multi-touch" support, but usually this just means they support 2-finger gestures like pinch-style zooming. Apple, on the other hand, gives a whole new meaning to the term, supporting up to ten simultaneous touches, and app developers have certainly leveraged that capacity. For example, one popular app supporting ten simultaneous touches is the Piano app.===== So What Can the iPad mini Actually Do? =====Naturally, there are things you can do with the iPad mini right out of the box. You can browse the Web with Safari, set up your email, download your photos and videos from your computer via iTunes, as well as shoot new photos and videos using either of the two built in cameras. You can also surf YouTube via Apple's built-in YouTube app. There's also an iPod built in, so you can listen to your favorite tunes via the Music app, or download new music, movies and media via the iTunes app. Another popular app is iBooks, which lets you download and read e-books on your iPad mini. You can also jot notes, manage your calendar and contacts. You can even chat face-to-face with other Apple-device users via FaceTime.Of course, the fun and usefulness of the iPad mini doesn't stop there. The App Store app is your portal to unending games and utilities. One thing Apple has been really good at is showing off just what you can do with an iPad, and the same goes for the iPad mini. All iPad apps work on the iPad mini. After all, the iPad mini is still an iPad. App developers have undoubtedly been busy creating unique experiences through their iPad apps, most of which have yet to be rivaled by (or ported to) Android and other tablets.When Apple first announced the iPad they didn't tout it so much as an ebook reader as they did a "netbook killer" (due to its ability to surf the web, check email, watch videos, listen to music, and do a lot of the simpler tasks that netbooks were originally designed to do. But along its path to success, it sparked a revolution in the publication and delivery of full-color magazines, news and now even ebooks via Apple's iBooks app. Now, it's quite clear that Apple had the goal of a much more comfortable ebook reading experience in mind when they set out to create the iPad mini. You can easily hold it in one hand, just like a real book, and it's as light as a real book, two traits many users have been hoping to see come to fruition soon.On the other hand, to use the iPad mini for more productive purposes, such as editing office documents, you'll need to download Apple's productivity suite iWork, a trilogy of apps including: Pages (word processing), Numbers (spreadsheets) and Keynote (slideshows). Each of the three apps can be downloaded separately for $9.99 each. Completely reworked for the iPad, the complete iWork suite will set you back a whole thirty bucks. So be aware of that before you go ahead and grab the iPad mini for use with work-related document editing, and so forth.Also note that if you do intend to use the iPad for heavy writing or word-processing purposes, you'll find that your ability to type quickly will be greatly inhibited by the virtual keyboard. Thus, you should snag the external keyboard as well (Note: I'll also explain some typing techniques below). Either way, be prepared to pay more than merely the price for the iPad mini alone. There's clearly more than meets the eye if you intend to transform the iPad mini into something a little more productive than it might be for you out of the box.===== Downloading Apps and Games =====Downloading apps on your iPad mini couldn't be easier. Once you set up your iTunes account with a password and credit card (or iTunes gift card), all you need to do is launch the 'App Store' app, browse or search to find the app you want, tap the download button (usually it says the price rather than 'download', which then changes to 'install app' after you tap it), then tap again to confirm. Enter your password, and voila, you just bought an app. Behind the scenes, Apple then charges your card (or deducts from your gift card balance) the amount of the app plus tax, while you're already off enjoying your new purchase. This ease of access is a blessing and a curse, because you can easily empty your wallet if you're not carefully considering each purchase.All apps in the App Store range in price from Free and 99 cents on up, always incrementing in whole dollar amounts (1.99, 2.99, 3.99, etc). The maximum price for an app is set to $999.99, of which there are only eight currently priced so outrageously. And don't even think of toying with them. Apple does not allow refunds on apps you have purchased--all sales are final!Now for the juicy money-saving secrets of the App Store! With the proper resources, you can legitimately download thousands of high quality apps for free. I do it all the time and it's perfectly legal. You see, Apple allows developers to temporarily put their apps on sale (and even drop the price to free). Usually they do this in hopes that you'll write a rave review for the temporarily-free app. The secret to your success here is having the resources to help you spot these special app sales--so you know when and where to get them during these often extremely-limited-time promotions.In hopes of making this the most helpful review on Amazon for the iPad mini, here's how to obtain these special promotional-sale and temporarily-free apps for yourself!There are several resources you can use, both on the Web and on the iPad mini itself. I prefer to use an app called "AppShopper" which lists all apps that recently went on sale or dropped to free. You can filter just iPad apps, or show iPhone apps as well, and you can also filter just the free products or just the sale apps. But so many apps go on sale, making it hard to cut through the clutter, which is where AppShopper truly shines: the "popular" tab shows only the most popularly downloaded sale apps. If several other people aren't downloading an app, you won't see it listed there! AppShopper is a phenomenal little gem, and it has gotten me tons of apps FREE! It also has a companion website that lists the same apps. You can even create an account and track the apps you own, so you don't end up trying to redownload them if they go on sale again! It also supports watch lists (via your account) with push notifications, and can alert you whenever an app you're interested in goes on sale. It's a real thing of beauty! There are other apps such as AppZappPush, AppSniper, AppAdvice, Apps Gone Free, and more, but none of them leverage the power of the masses to help you filter out the unwanted apps. Feel free to check them out if you like, though!===== Typing on the iPad mini =====Typing on the iPad mini has certainly become a bit less burdensome than with its 10" iPad counterpart, especially in the way of thumb-typing. However, typing lengthy messages can still be a concern. Obviously, the iPad mini is no laptop--you won't be speed-typing, so it may not be conducive for heavy usage like typing lengthy emails or blogging, let alone writing this review. With that in mind, there are a couple approaches you can try to determine what typing method is right for you. The ideal method might also change depending on where you are and how the iPad is oriented when using it.Typing Method #1: ThumbsThe most flexible approach is to type with your thumbs, which can be done whether sitting or standing. In portrait mode: grasp the bottom of your iPad with your palms facing each other, and your pinky fingers towards you for the iPad to rest on. To stabilize the iPad and prevent it from flopping over and falling out of your hands, stretch both of your index fingers upwards towards the top of the iPad as much as is comfortable. Using your thumbs, hunt & peck the keys on the virtual keyboard to your heart's content.Alternately, if you press and hold the show/hide button on the bottom right corner of the keyboard, you can choose to split the keyboard, which makes it easier for your thumbs to reach all keys. You can also choose to undock the keyboard, which centers it vertically on the screen, instead of at the bottom. Undocked keyboard can be split or merged, per your preferences.Typing Method #2: Two FingersIf thumb-typing isn't your style, try holding the iPad mini in one hand, like a book, and use your index and middle fingers to go back and forth across the virtual keyboard. Alternately, if the iPad mini is resting on a surface and is in landscape orientation, you could try using two fingers from each hand, but I don't think the iPad mini is big enough to type with your full range of fingers like the 10" iPad is.Typing Method #3: Speech to TextWith iOS 5 and Siri, Apple has brought us an even more convenient way to type, thanks to Siri! Just hit the microphone icon on the lower-left side of the keyboard, and start speaking. In most cases, your words will be transcribed into the currently active text field, with potentially mis-interpreted words underlined in blue. Just select any such word, and a list of possible alternates will pop up for your choosing.You can also speak most punctuation, such as 'period', 'question mark', 'exclamation mark', 'open-paren', 'close-paren', 'hyphen', 'single quote', 'double quote', 'ellipsis' and more. Siri is built into the iOS software and is a free service, but one caveat of using Siri for speech transcription is that you must be connected to the Web at the time of transcription, because Siri is a primarily Web-based service (albeit a free one). At times, network congestion has been known to hinder the ability for this feature to work properly, but that happens much less frequently now and usually only occurs if your device is connected to a poor cellular signal instead of WiFi.Other methods of typing on the iPad include the external keyboard, as well as third party speech-to-text transcription apps like Dragon, but with Siri's voice transcription feature built in, the latter is no longer necessary.===== Web Browsing =====Alongside email, and spending money in the app store, Web browsing is one of Apple's biggest suggestions for using the device. The iPad mini's small stature is no less capable, and its screen resolution of 1024x768 tends to concur, especially in landscape mode. Most websites are around 800-1000 pixels wide, so when the iPad mini is in landscape orientation, Apple's built-in Safari Web browser or Google's downloadable Chrome app will render any sites that are less than 1024 pixels wide at their intended original size, meaning you see them at their true size, rather than seeing a smaller, more compressed version of the site. Chrome lets you keep an unlimited number of browser tabs in the background, while Safari limits you to 9 tabs (at least until iOS 6 is released).The good thing about Web browsing on the iPad and iPad mini is that you can rotate the orientation. Content on the Web was born to be viewed vertically (in portrait orientation), not horizontally (landscape orientation) as most laptops and desktop computers use. In general, I tend to prefer browsing the Web in portrait mode, since web pages are almost always taller than they are wide. Still, even in portrait mode, the iPad mini allows you to see more content at a still-decent size. Of course, even in portrait orientation, the compressed pages rendered are still easily readable without squinting your eyes, which isn't often the case for Web browsing on the iPhone/iPod Touch. Plus, you can always zoom into any section by quickly double tapping any region of the active page. Even zoomed-in regions are displayed with crisp clarity, and the browser's interface is swift and responsive.However, not all your sites will work desirably on the iPad. Apple closed-mindedly refuses to support Adobe Flash on the iPad (as it has with the iPhone/iPod Touch). Flash content is now being used less and less, in favor of newer content technologies like HTML5's canvas and JavaScript effects, which can emulate some of Flash's most familiar capabilities, but sites using Flash do still exist. Flash is often used for advertising, video playback, browser-based online gaming, and for many other interactive site components, from graphs to product demos. However, the Flash experience on tablets that do support it is still quite poor in the interactivity department, especially considering that Adobe never intended for it to be used on touch screens. Thus, certain Flash content may expect a mouse hover and you can't emulate that with a finger on a touch screen.While I found browsing the Web with a 10" iPad to be a literal pain in the neck, the lightweight and small stature of the iPad mini has certainly improved the experience. It's easier to handle, to hold upright with a single hand while browsing the web with the other, and it's more comfortable to hold. Since I didn't surf much with my 10" iPad, I have no qualms about the lack of a retina display. I'd rather have this iPad mini with the same resolution as the iPad 2 and a 10-hour battery life with a much smaller batter, than to have an iPad mini with a retina display and either a 4-hour battery life, or a battery as heavy as that of the 10" iPad!===== Email, IM and Social Networking =====Email on the iPad mini's Mail app is best viewed in landscape mode, as it allows you to see both your list of messages on the left as well as the selected message itself on the right. It also makes managing emails easier, such as moving messages to other folders (or to the trash). Another reason for landscape mode is to make typing those lengthy emails easier (using typing-method #2 mentioned above).You can have multiple email accounts, including Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange and other custom POP3 and IMAP accounts.Important Note: With the growing number of portable web connecting devices, there is one concern I want to express on your behalf. When you close the Mail app, it continues running in the background, even after disconnecting from one WiFi hotspot and reconnecting to another. My concern with this is that if haven't set up your e-mail with a secure connection, and you connect to a public WiFi hotspot that a malicious user is monitoring, then the instant your mail app connects to the hotspot to check your e-mail, your e-mail credentials may be suddenly compromised. To avoid this you definitely want to be using some kind of secure connection for your e-mail if at all possible. Web-based email such as Gmail typically support this out of the box, and Gmail accounts are the easiest to setup on the iPad mini.===== Media =====If you own an iPhone or iPod Touch, it's comforting to know that you audio/video experience will be similar on the iPad mini. You can watch videos via the YouTube app, which has been updated for the iPad mini to show YouTube HD videos beautifully. While the 1024x768 resolution of the iPad mini is a standard 4:3 ratio, not a widescreen 16:9 ratio, the HD videos as well as other video (including downloads from the iTunes store) display just fine, albeit with black bars. Some may not like that though, but I don't see a wide-screen iPad mini coming to market for a while.The Netflix and Hulu+ apps are great for members of those online video streaming services. Netflix videos stream quickly and even moving the play position back and forth in the timeline, the movie starts playing very quick without much time rebuffering the video. For those who want to watch live TV, I also recommend getting yourself a Slingbox and snagging the SlingPlayer app to stream live TV to your iPad mini. I do that, and it works quite well!===== Photos and Video =====The new iPad mini brings a phenomenal new high-quality 5MP camera to market that picks up where the iPad 2's half-megapixel camera left off. 5 lenses inside the aperture, and the more powerful processor, combine to create the sharpest iPad image yet. Even low-light pictures are better than ever, though there's still room for improvement there. There's also a new iPhoto app from Apple that lets you organize, edit and share your photos right on the iPad mini!Plus, you can now record full-HD (1080p) videos, instead of just the previous 720p videos. Though I must warn you, if you plan to shoot a lot of video with the iPad mini, you'll want to go with a 32GB or 64GB model! These incredibly high-quality videos take up an incredibly large amount of storage space!===== E-Reading =====Whether it's books, magazines or news, the iPad is making an impact on the future of media reading on a whole new level. Apple has been under-emphasizing the e-book and e-publication reading capabilities of the iPad to date, but I feel it's one of the iPad mini's greatest strengths, especially with it being about the size of a book. Magazine, newspaper and now book publishers have been jumping onboard the iPad bandwagon by creating their own iBooks and iPad apps, taking their publications to a whole new level, interactively and financially too.My experiences interacting with some of these digital representations of magazines and newspapers have been a breath of fresh air. Being able to read them on a screen simply isn't enough. The ability to still touch them, combined with a rich interactivity on a level that can't be matched by their printed counterparts has really given new life to what I feared was becoming a dying trade. Of course, another big perk for me has been the ability to save space because now I can keep all my magazines around without ever taking up more than the size of a single book.As far as Amazon ebooks go, you're not losing out by passing up on their Kindle line of tablets, because you have full access to Kindle books on the iPad mini via Amazon's Kindle app. If you read a lot outdoors and don't mind reading in shades of gray rather than in full-color, then perhaps the Kindle Paperwhite (not Kindle Fire) is more your style. Kindle uses e-ink which is much easier to read in the sunlight.All in all, the iPad mini is an great e-reader on a whole new level. Had it touted a retina display, text would be slightly more crisp, albeit at the cost of long battery life. I'll take longer battery life over slightly more crisp text any day. Text on the iPad mini looks fine, unless it's really small, and that's usually only the case for an occasional website, but not ebooks.===== Productivity =====Productivity carries numerous definitions. Usually its "getting something done" though some people tend to believe that it's the ability to focus without being distracted, which I see as one of the iPad mini's strengths because of its single-app-at-a-time multitasking approach.In the context of software though, applications that allow you to edit office documents are commonly referred to as productivity software. Apple's own suite of productivity apps, collectively called "iWork", lets you do just that. For work-minded individuals, it will probably one of the most popular uses of the iPad mini. There are three apps in all: Pages is a word processing app that allows you to create and edit word processing documents, Numbers allows you to create and edit spreadsheets, and Keynote, which lets you create or edit presentations and slideshows (including PowerPoint files). Keynote has been pretty invaluable in giving personal presentations within small groups or one-on-one meetings with an iPad, but I'm not sure the iPad mini would be as comfortable using for presentations.There's also a productivity category in the App Store dedicated to additional apps geared towards helping you be more productive. Remember, any app that works for the iPhone and iPad will run on the iPad mini, but do note that there are some exceptional productivity apps specifically made or updated for the iPad and iPad mini. Some notable iPad-specific productivity apps include Bento (personal organization/information management), Things (project management), iTeleport (remote desktop/VNC), Layers (drawing/painting), and GoodReader (best PDF+ reader around).===== Gaming =====If you're like me, you probably don't have time for games. Ultimately, I still see the iPad as a productivity device more than as a gaming console. Regardless, the iPhone and iPad changed the game on that. Millions of people use their computers for gaming, and with the iPhone and iPod Touch having taken on a clear role as a gaming console that has been as revolutionary for mobile gaming as the Wii was for living-room gaming, it goes without saying that the iPad mini is, and will continue to be, a decent platform for playing games. Most Android games look terrible on tablet-sized screens, but iPad game developers have taken care of iPad users with good quality iPad versions of most iPhone games. Board games and lap-friendly games are better for the 10" iPad than the iPad mini. Meanwhile, games heavily dependent on device-rotation and other accelerometer-based interaction are much conducive for use on the iPad mini than the 10" iPad.===== Printing =====Printing with the iPad mini is really hit-or-miss. Apple's iOS 4 brought the ability to print documents from their devices, but there are some caveats. Your printer must support "AirPrint" or, if yours doesn't, you might have success using Printopia software, so long as you have a Mac with a shared printer. Search Google for 'AirPrint' or 'Printopia' for more info and printer compatibility. From there, printing is easy, for apps that support it. The first time you attempt to print something, the iPad mini will walk you through the process of locating the printer and setting up the printing options. For more information about printing with your iPad mini, I'll link to some informative off-site pages in the first comment for this review.===== Security =====With portable devices, there should always be some level of concern regarding the safety and protection of your data. The iPad mini delivers surprisingly well in the area--it provides several layers of security to protect your data. You can require complex passcodes to securely access important information, encrypt data whether stored or transferred over WiFi, and even remotely wipe everything from your iPad instantly in the event of theft or loss (with subscription to Apple's MobileMe service). Apple even provides a free device-location service.===== Praise =====+ Clever use of space to cram an 8" screen into a 7" class of device that can be held with one hand!+ Apple continues its trend of creating the best multi-touch experience around. Android doesn't even come close.+ High performance 1GHz A5X processor - provides performance power for cutting-edge gaming and multitasking.+ Multitasks like a dream with iOS 5 and the dual-core A5 processor, despite the same 256MB of memory as the third generation touch.+ Rear camera - 5 megapixel photography goodness, plus it can do HD video.+ 4G LTE - It's clearly the next big thing for improving connection speed when away from WiFi+ Supported on Sprint - previous iPads only supported Verizon and AT&T+ Lower iPad entry price point===== Caveats =====+ No Retina Display - But at the added benefit of a lighter battery that holds its charge just as long.===== Disappointments =====+ No GPS (or assisted GPS with 4G model) - IP based location just doesn't cut it at times. GPS has no subscription fee or contract to use+ No NFC - Near Field Communications is what powers PayPass in credit cards, and there are certainly uses for it in devices, especially for data transfer, if not for making payments or redeeming passes with the Passbook app.+ No 128GB model - would have been useful for high-res videos, or hold more of those 1080p videos you can shoot+ No USB or SD card slot - for storage expansion, or more importantly, for importing pics from your external camera for use with the new iPhoto app+ No numeric character row in keyboard, despite plenty of space on the iPad and iPad mini's screen.===== The Bottom Line =====There's really not much to complain about in an iPad now. Sure, retina display would be nice, but if we'd been given that, we'd be complaining about battery life, heavy weight or performance issues. Meanwhile, the 10" iPad has its uses, but portability isn't one of its strong suits. The iPad mini now fills that gap, and it's really been a dream to use. If 10" is comfortable for you, go with an iPad. As for me, the iPad mini has mostly lived up to my tablet desires.Do you really 'need' the retina display? The honest truth is, no. See, Apple has certainly come to spoil us with its latest and greatest hardware, including the retina display, but I really don't see the iPad mini's less phenomenal display as a real deal breaker. I also a believer that the original iPad or iPad 2 are still great devices if you like the 10" class of tablet, and they don't have the retina display. So, really, why wait around another year for something better to come along? Then again, there's no absolute guarantee that the next iPad mini will even have that retina display.The bottom line is, don't wait around and waste these precious cycles of your life hoping and betting on something better to come around, when you can always buy the current iPad Mini now, enjoy it now, and resell it down the road. Apple products always hold most of their value for a long time, because they're in such high demand.I hope you've found my hands-on review helpful. Feel free to keep the discussion going via the comments! :)!###Bought item for company Christmas party.  The recipient opened package and item would not turn on.  I contacted apple support and they stated that iPad was purchased back in July and registered to another person.  I was sold a used and defective product.  Sending it back for a return.!###First off, this re-seller got my Mini out to me on time.  Or actually, Amazon did (I think it was fulfilled by Amazon).The Apple ID numbers were covered up by a sticker attached by the re-seller.  I had to carefully peel this back so I could call Apple and get the smut on this particular device (more on that below).  I wanted to make sure that is was not a repackaged, used device, as others have reviewed, or that it was refurbished, or purchased over 30 days ago (and thus ineligble for AppleCare- also reviewed below).  I was able to peel off the sticker without ruining the plastic wrap, which would have made my return 'opened'.A corner of the box was slightly dinged in, and the plastic wrap on the box looked pretty well scuffed up, and definitely gave the appearance that it had been bounced around quite a bit.I did not open the box, as I found out from Apple that this was not actually a brand new device.I looked for but did not find a Mini sold directly by Amazon.  It appears (and an Apple Tech confirmed this) that Amazon does not sell Apple products, instead relying on resellers to take on that onus.  Is this all cause of the Kindle?What impact does that have on us?  In most cases, you will be ineligible for AppleCare. AppleCare is a huge benefit for most purchasers, covering all types of damage up to 2 years.  If you buy an Apple product from someone other than an Apple store, you can still enroll your device in AppleCare, but it must be done within 30 days of purchase, and it must be done at an Apple store.When you purchase an Apple product through Amazon, you are getting a device that in most cases was purchased by someone like us, at a BestBuy, WalMart, Target, etc, at some point in the recent past.  They then 're-sell' the device on Amazon.  Apple uses the origianl date of purchase from the Apple vendor (the BestBuy, Walmart, Target, etc) to start the 30 day AppleCare counter.  In my case, my Mini arrived on the 30th day from original purchase.  I had 3 hours to get my device down to an Apple store, get it enrolled in AppleCare, or else I would be SOL.  Fortunately, Amazon's incredible return policy enabled me to just go online and in a few clicks print out my free return label.As an FYI, Apple stores are the absolute best way to purchase an Apple device.  Not only are they cheaper (mine was actually the same price, with tax, as it was from Amazon), but they will spend over an hour with you getting it set up, linked to your iTunes, your iPhone, iCloud, etc.  It's an amazing experience, and it's all free with your purchase.I challenge Amazon (and Apple) to combine their two excellent companies and develop a strategy for online buying experience that actually enhances each other's products/services, rather than detract from them as they do now.!###I echo Reader44's review (above) about getting a supposedly new iPad Mini from Amazon that turned out to be used.  My Mini arrived on Friday with paperwork showing that it was being provided by Freebie Electronics.  I had no problem getting it configured on my wireless WiFi network Saturday morning.  I then called Verizon and provided the necessary information to connect using 3G.  However, it would not connect even though I had the Verizon logo and three bars on the screen.  I called Verizon back, and another person told me there was a "problem," and I needed to speak with the Fraud Prevention department, which was not open weekends.  Or I could go to a Verizon store and have someone there look at it.  I opted for the latter and drove to the Verizon store in Torrington, CT.  Someone there checked it out, entered some data from the Mini on her computer, and confirmed that the Mini had been previously sold to someone else.  The unit was "blacklisted" because that someone had neglected to pay his or her Verizon account.  No, Verizon won't unlock the Mini, so I have to return it to Amazon for a replacement.  Amazon's web site says Freebie Electronics gets 4.9 out of 5 stars, which seems hard to believe if that company makes a habit of providing used electronics to Amazon for sale as new.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed with Amazon. I have bought lots of stuff, not just computers, from Amazon and certainly expected better.!###I'm an avid reader and a writer who has tried every portable device under the sun. Smart phones (even the large ones) are too small to read comfortably or to type; laptops simply are not portable enough due to short battery lives; and other tablets were uncomfortably large for me (I've got small hands.) I've tried taking notes directly on screens with a stylus; I've tried Bluetooth keyboards; and I've tried typing directly on screens. Everything was either too large or too small. Other, similarly-sized tablets tend to lag, or the battery life is very poor.I've been an Apple holdout for a while. I had a little iBook a long time ago, and the system issues, general uselessness of the battery, the severe problems with transferring Word, Corel, and other word processing documents, and all-around, irritating, proprietary nature of Mac turned me off for several years. Don't get me started on what I thought of the pricing.After doing a lot of research, however, I took a chance on an iPad mini. It was the perfect size (decent screen, super thin, super light) the battery life is supposedly long (it is--seven hours on the brightest screen setting, several days on standby, 10-12 hours with a low or medium bright screen) extremely portable (very, very important) easy to backup (and from the backup, export to different formats if needed) and does exactly what I need it to do (word processing, graphic art, reading, and surfing.) I have never been happier with an electronic device. (I also use it as an iPod. And as a player for my Google Drive. It's fabulous.)To repeat, it's absolutely perfect for me. I can work on it for hours, it's powerful enough for professional art programs, it's great for writing (the native note app, Google Drive, the Corel app, and a couple of others) and it is by far the best screen for reading I've come across.I tried a Bluetooth keyboard, thinking the screen would be too small to type on. The Bluetooth was a dud--it only worked once--but that was a happy accident. The iPad mini is exactly the right size for me to comfortably type onscreen.I have no complaints with Safari. It's super-fast and while it isn't my favorite search engine ever, it naturally does the job. The only issue I had was figuring out how to open a link in a new tab. (This took me a week. I can be a little slow.)Now that the rave is over, there are a couple of caveats.First, while the screen is the perfect size for me to type on, I'm a small female with hands about 2/3 average size, so it may be too small for some people to comfortably type on.Second, there are (as noted by other reviewers) no USB ports. If you need a lot of memory, this is not the device for you. There is no easy way to expand it. This was actually a little disappointing for me, but Google Drive and Dropbox solved the problem for me. (I'm a lucky person who is never far away from a WiFi signal.)Also, there is no way to replace the battery. When it starts dying, it's done.It doesn't have the retina display that comes with the larger iPads. (It's still a better resolution than many other devices, but hey--no retina display is no retina display.)Finally, there isn't really any way to get around the price. It costs more than some laptops, and certainly more than the other tablets of its size.Personally, I think it's worth it. The sheer portability and quality of the item is incredible. The fact that it is literally perfect for everything I need to do makes it even better--for me.I strongly recommend the iPad mini, with one caveat: do your research. Make absolutely sure you know exactly what you need and what you want, and invest in a product that meets that. This is not the item for someone who needs a lot of onboard memory or a ton of power. Someone who wants just to surf or just an e-reader may be better served with another product, too--but then again, maybe not (like I said, this functions as the most delightful e-reader ever.)I love it, and I think most people will. Have fun =)!###I was very excited waiting for this product to come in. I paid just as much for it as I would have directly from apple, so I was not expecting any troubles. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I turn my new iPad mini on and the screen immediately begins flickering and has white streaks through the screen. Garbage. Absolute garbage. Also, this store is unable to do exchanges through amazon, so in order for me to get a working iPad, I now have to take the time to mail the defective one back, wait for the money to be put back on my account, and then place another order (from a different store obviously). I am extremely disappointed.!###iPad mini review  I passionately love the iPad mini. My friends said it was pointless but its not. It is physically smaller than the iPad but it has the same excellent quality. Its a lot lighter than the iPad. You may think its to small it's not, the commercials kind of make it look smaller, you get used to the size very easily. The size is very convenient  and it still feels like the full iPad experience.It is fast as well. The camera is nice and the speakers aren't bad like the iPod touches. I actually prefer the size it's not big and bulky, you can take it out in public and feel a lot less awkward than with a real iPad. If you want a tablet for strictly work use maybe the iPad is a better choice, however if you're just going to use it for a work and games, entertainment, photos etc. I definitely recommend it.Display  It has a gorgeous display. It is not retina display but I've compared devices with and with out retina and there is virtually no difference in the display. It also has an awesome battery life. It isn't less than the iPad. Apple really did go back to the very beginning and put a lot of effort into this device. It is much better than the kindle fire. This device's light weight, beautiful display, fast speed, quality speakers and camera, makes it easy to use, take on the go, present, and enjoy!Camera  It has a camera, the pictures are like cell phone pictures, but if the room which you're in is bright and you give it a second to get focused the camera is magnificent, especially outside on a sunny day!Siri  As you probably know this device includes Siri. Siri I often don't use because I'm not in the habit of it. But when I do remind my self it is helpful. Not only is it helpful but to play around without, it has a (specific) response to everything you say. Also I find it really neat that if I'm typing a document I can just press a button and it types what I say, which is wonderful for rough drafts and stuff! This also works if you're searching something etc.Space & Apps  I got the 16 gb version however the space I had available was only about 13gb, which really wasn't too bad, just take in to consideration, that 3 of the gbs  won't be available for use because of what is already installed (no, you cannot delete what is already installed). So, if you're someone who takes lots of videos, photos, plans to make movies, have apps where a lot of data will be contained (iMovie, pages, etc.) Get the 32 gb one, or you can do what I do is take videos and photos, then upload them onto my computer, then delete the data entirely from my iPad, beacause videos and pictures take up a lot of space, however one or two short videos are fine. Just manage your space, but 16 gb is really a fine amount (I'm only at 7).  The apps on apple devices are magnificent, it's not just fun games, there are some for creating documents, educational ones, apps for teachers, photo editing, the Holy Bible! Even medical apps, that give you instructions for medical emergencies or problems, and there is a really neat one on the brain, apps that help you find your iPad if it's lost!  There also is iMovie, if you are unformiliar which it, it is this really neat program that allows you to make movies, it simple, and looks extremely professional it s only $5 in the App Store, so worth the money!  V.S Other Products  Yes, there are cheaper things like the Gooogle Nexus tablet, Samsung Galaxy Note, KINDLE FIRE, and other android tablets/computer tablets, but if you have any i-device (iPod touch, iPod nano, iPhone, etc.) you know the experience is way different than android and for many people way better. It isn't much more, and I know people who have gotten rid of there other tablets (in perfectly good condition) for the iPad mini. And it also had a variety of e-reading apps. And the computer/tablet devices are neat... but $700 more. Besides flash it has all the abilities as computers (refer to &#34;Space & Apps&#34;), and for the few flash-involved I'm sure there is a computer somewhere in your house.  In conclusion, this device is wonderful. I've been exposed and experienced with multiple devices, this is still awesome!  In conclusion, this device is amazing.  I switched several people to the iPad mini. Tablets are all made by intelligent people, but this device is made my geniuses. It has, Siri, good speakers, nice camera, very convenient size, for watching movies viewing photos etc, still light, compact, portable. Beautiful display, cheap price, good battery life, best device ever!!###I would love to give this device a five star rating. I really would. It's a brilliant device. It is the perfect size for an iPad. It fits comfortably in my hand, and yes, i can even fit it in my pockets still (but I'm a 6' 4" guy so ladies don't expect the same) The keyboard I type this review with on screen is perfect for typing with thumbs. No need to stretch at all, but the buttons aren't like the iPod or iPhone where if you're not careful you'll mistype frequently. The screen resolution is gorgeous, and I love using this as my contact book and planner. Web browsing is very fast but here's where we come to the issue.If you do a search on Google and Apple forums, you will find a lot of complaints that the iPad Mini won't stay connected to WiFi. The iOS 6.0.2 update was supposed to fix this, but it has not. I find my iPad will connect to the router just fine, but it won't always connect to the Internet. I can have three bars of WiFi reception and still not be able to pull up a web page, use my apps, etc. I have found one person who said he solved this by manually inputting the router data, but I still need to try this. More likely I'm hoping that the first batch of these iPads were "lemons" so to speak and I'll go to the Apple Store and try to exchange it. I haven't had this device for even a week so hopefully they'll allow me to do so.I am thinking sometime down the road Apple will patch this. But until they do, I simply can't give it the Five Star review I want to give it. I will update this if I find a solution. If those of you Amazon users find a solution, please let me know with comments!!###HiBefore I give you the review, let me tell you about my background. I am a college student who is very into tech. I've owned many tablets, and even more phones. I buy them used and sell them used, so I swap between a lot of devices. It's a bad habit, I know, but I really want to find that perfect device.Tablets I've owned:-iPad 1,2,3-Galaxy Tab 10.1-Nexus 7 (2012)I bought the iPad mini because I recently bought an iPhone 5 (from Nexus 4) to compliment my Macbook Air. I always went with Android devices because of how cheap they were, but I decided to splurge on an iOS/Mac ecosystem and see how well they sync together. I chose the iPad Mini because I think that the original iPads are too big. Also I like how thin the bezels are for the mini.So now you know why I bought the mini, here are my list of Pros and Cons.PROS:- Display. Yes I know, it's not retina, but it is still an IPS display. I would take an IPS display with 720p over any other display with 1080p. It's vibrant, colors are sharp. A retina would make it even better, but for me it's not that big of a deal.- Size and weight. So slim and light it's sexy. This is the main reason I picked this Mini over and iPad with retina. All the old iPads I've used, I never find myself using them often because it's tiring to hold them up for anything longer than a few minutes. WIth the mini, it's much easier.- Build quality. The main reason I've always envied apple users, their products are always such beauties.- iPad specific apps. Android tablet apps are just scaled up versions of phone apps, which makes the experience very dull. On the iPad, many apps have iPad versions, which uses the screen real-estate much better.- Internet. Browsing the web in safari is much better experience than on an Android tablet. It's faster, smoother, and everything just fits on the screen.CONS:iTunes. The lack of file management in iOS. This is the MAIN reason I'm having such a frustrating time on the iPad.  I like my iPhone, but dislike the iPad because of iTunes. It boils down to what I do on my iPhone vs what I do on my iPad. On the iPhone, I generally use it to go online, call/text, take pics, siri, youtube, email, etc. Very common stuff. On the iPad however, all I really do is read ebooks and watch videos. Given that, the reason I dislike the iPad is that it relies on iTunes way too much. I can't simply drag and drop video/ebook files into the ipad like I can do with any android device, I have to sync through iTunes. That itself is not that big of a deal, EXCEPT that iTunes only recognizes SOME of the very common files. For example, I have a lot of TV series saved on my Computer. Mostly all TV series files and some movie files are in AVI format, which is an extremely common video file type, but iTunes does not support it. If I wanted to get those files onto  my iPad, I'd have to convert the entire collection from AVI to MP4 individually, then drag them into iTunes, then sync it up with my iPad.Lightning. It's rare, and very expensive. Basically all the microUSB chargers I have are useless now. Not many people have the new 8pin lightning cords lying around, so you're SOL if you go out without your cord and your iPad dies on you. With android devices, there are microUSBs all over my house and in my car, so do most of my friends, so it's no worry. Also the lightning cords are very expensive. Often $20+. MicroUSBs, on the other hand, is often less than $2. The only clear advantage I can see of owning a lightning is that you can plug it in any side you want...big whoop.Lack of stereo speakers. Since I watch videos on it all the time, I wished it had stereo speakers like the Nexus 10 and the new Nexus 7.CONCLUSION:So there's my reasons. I am not a fanboy of android nor apple, they both have their pros and cons. The iPad is still the best tablet to browse the web for, which is probably what a lot of you will do. But if you're like me and sees yourself watching videos on it and reading ebooks, and has a huge library saved in your computer, then you might want to get an android tablet.!###This is a very non-technical review -- the newest version of the iPad rocks with its portability. This iPad mini easily slips into a purse or jacket pocket making it easy to carry around for either a female or male. You get all of the perks of the regular iPad with the extra benefit of being able to carry it around with you everywhere. Simply amazing!I love my iPad and use it more than any other electronic devise but I mourned its lack of portability. The iPad's size is great for watching tv, movies, reading books or light document work but a hassle to carry around. I had to dig out my huge purse to carry it around anywhere and the weight and size was cumbersome. This iPad mini is slimmer, lighter and smaller and oh so convenient to take with me when I leave the house.The smaller size does impact my document usage but since I use it mostly for entertainment, this is really minor for me but will affect those who use the iPad for work. I keep hearing the iPad mini lacks the same power (slower processor) as the iPad but I don't feel it. I've played games on it, watched videos, etc. without any noticeable difference. Maybe power is an issue with heavy document usage? I did deduct a half star for the lower screen resolution than the newest iPad while keeping the price tag around $350. Seriously?  The lower resolution is not so much apparent on iTunes purchases but more visible on home video or other sourced digital media.How does Apple seduce me into wanting their newest product (although, I'm proud so say I avoided their siren's call for the iPhone 5) and after using it, making it the newest best thing I cannot live without? Husband says it makes the regular iPad positively clunky and almost archaic but I think it's more sinister - it makes me appreciate the iPad for home use and the iPad mini for away-from-home use. Great, now I've used up my gift allowance for all of 2013....but you won't find me complaining this Christmas, birthday or anniversary because the iPad mini is worth it!Overall, if you can splurge this is the one thing you really want to spend your money on. As long as you are looking primarily for entertainment value, the iPad mini provides all the same options of the iPad (apps, digital media and dependability) but on a smaller, lighter and more portable scale.!###Whether this is your first iPad or a replacement to an aging iPad, then you should consider the good, bad and the ugly before adding to your cart. I replaced a 32GB 1G iPad with a 32GB wi-fi mini. So, of course, the mini adds some features right off the bat that make it a major improvement over the 1G, but most importantly, this device travels with me more often than my previous iPad ever did.The GoodThe size! The mini seems perfectly designed for two thumb typing. Even with split-screen dock keyboard, I always found the on-screen keyboard to be cumbersome and difficult.Siri on the iPad is quite convenient as a desktop accessory and a mobile feature.The BadWhen compared side by side with Samsung or the Amazon Fire HD, the device doesn't stack up with display, audio, and peripheral input. This is the bad that everyone points to and there are some features lacking (some of which will not be resolved in future versions).The lightning connector - having apple devices for over a decade has many 30-pin connectors laying around the house. Now we have to lightning connectors in the house, so they are in hot demand. The connector doesn't always fit firmly, so sometimes I check the device to a disappointing 16% charge.The UglyThe display doesn't bother me as much as others, but the lack of retina display has bothered a number of owners. Of course this will be resolved soon.In the end, I would buy it again, and I don't have any regrets knowing that improved features are on the way.!###I was not planning on buying this product, after seeing the specs with the amazon kindle fire hd I was actually planning on buying that. Better screen, cheaper, etc. after I went to best buy and actually played around with the fire, I hated it. It was bulky and seemed old, you couldn't even take pictures on it! Later, I was at the apple store with my sister while she got her iPhone 5 fixed, and I picked up the mini for the first time. Not only does it feel much more classy and expensive, it was thinner, lighter, and had a perfect screen size. The keyboard is so easy to type on, I'm actually using it right now. When I am using it in public I get a lot of comments because some people haven't seen it yet! When I use iPads they seem so bulky now, I love that the mini uses more screen size on the front and doesn't waste space like the full size ipad! I use the mini basically every moment of the day unless I'm working or with friends. At school, I took notes on it and I am excited to save money on text books next year, the ebooks are cheap and look great! Everyone complains about the screen resolution, but honestly I can't tell the difference, I think it looks the same as my retina I touch. I've never been more happy with a purchase. Tumblr is flawless on this device and so is Netflix! I would definitely recommend this over a full size ipad, save yourself some cash!!###I won't go in detail of the specs, there's plenty out there, so I'll just keep it in simple terms. This will be probably considered biased, being that I have way too many Apple products to count (iMacs, macbooks, mac mini, iphones, ipods, ipads etc..) so if you're not a fan of the truly brilliant company that is Apple, then you probably don't want to read this review.When I first heard of the mini coming out, I thought it was a joke, like really? Isn't that what the iPod touch is for? But when you go and hold this iPad, you truly see the difference between it's brothers and competition, and realize it is a great product in and of itself. The size of the screen is perfect, big enough to enjoy pictures / video, thin and light enough to toss in a bag on the go. I have the big brother New iPad, or iPad 3 or 4, whatever the heck they call it, and this is definitely a great individual product, and not just a scale down.I do have an Kindle Fire HD 7" and the iPad Mini is wider and longer, so the screen is a bit bigger. It looks great, feels great in your hands, even though I would recommend a case for it to add some girth, because even though it does feel great naked, it just seems way too easy to drop and slip out of your hands.What more can I really say? Quick surfing, mail, chatting, pictures, video, magazines, books, this is a great addition to whatever gadget arsenal you have. I have always stood behind Apple products and can't preach enough how great they are, how easily integrated all their products are together and so on. And not the nonsense chaos and confusion that is Android / PC.If you got an iPad, the iPad mini is still a great addition. If your just getting into the tablet scene, the mini is a great first buy. If you just want something cool, this is for ou.PSI love you Amazon, I am a prime member, I spend way too much money on this website, but why the heck are you guys selling this at $380? It's $329 retail??!###I purchased the 32gb LTE version and I am VERY satisfied with my purchase. I have the iPad 4, but wanted something smaller that was a bit more portable for traveling. I am so glad I made this purchase as it met my needs with overwhelming excitement. First, the size makes it feel easier to use for day-to-day activities such as web surfing and checking email. While I can do this with the iPad 4, the mini makes the user experience greater as there is less to tote around and is much much lighter than the iPad 4. After holding the iPad 4 for 30 minutes, it begins to feel like a brick. Holding the mini for 30 minutes doesn't even begin to tire out each of your arms from holding it for almost any period of time.Regarding the screen, it shows beautiful vibrant colors compared to the latest-gen iPad's. Owning both and comparing them side-by-side, I cannot tell the difference in quality while watching the same content on each of the units simultaneously. While I'm sure "retina display" is better in one way or another, it's hard to discern with the human eye as to the visual difference between the two. It's like comparing a 720p and a 1080p TV at 10 feet away - both look the same in regards to picture quality because the human eye cannot see the difference. For those that can "see" a difference, you must be holding the unit extremely close to your face (closer than just reading distance) or the "retina display is better" claim has tricked your mind into thinking you're seeing something that's simply not there. All of my family, including my young children, cannot tell the difference when watching movies or reading text. Even the content on my iPhone 5 seems a bit fuzzy, however when I pinch and zoom, it all goes away. The same is true of my iPad 4 which relates to the iPad mini. Don't let anyone fool you, the picture is gorgeous.As far as the LTE is concerned, it's lightning fast, however it will depend on your area. I can connect at 32mbps down and 9.5 mbps up in my area which is faster than my home broadband connection. I have no trouble hooking up to LTE and I always have a constant signal around my city. In addition, I have zero problems connecting to any wifi source. Here's the link to my screen capture from Speed Test: [...] I have a an iPad 2, iPad 4, iPhone 5's and the iPad mini. Across all platforms, the performance is fantastic albeit the performance on the iPad 2 is much slower in comparison to the mini, even though it has the same processor. My test is Sky Gamblers which plays a bit choppy on my iPad 2, but plays exactly the same as on my iPad 4 with an A6X processor.I added an Otterbox case and it nearly doubled the size of the unit. But WAIT!!!! This is a GOOD thing. It makes the iPad feel extremely comfortable in your hand and you will not lose grip as you may with the unit by itself since it's so thin and sleek. I have Otterbox Defender cases on all of my products mentioned above and swear by them. They are the best investment I've made in regards to accessories.In conclusion, this is one helluva product and I'm glad I purchased it. Do NOT be discouraged by the "retina display" hoopla that makes it seems as this is an inferior iPad. It's not in any way, shape or form. Using an iPad 4 to compare performance, the iPad mini mimics the exact performance that the iPad does, for the exception of programs opening about a half-second slower. I can definitely live with that. Hope this review helps.!###I bought new Ipad mini for my wife's birthday gift...but the happiness gone by seeing Ipad not charging well...The issue is with Ipad charging, for first time I put charging after the product got arrived, its worked. From Second time on-wards its giving sound and charging image blinking by making lot of noise...And tested Ipad by putting different chargers and some time its worked and for some its not worked.. So I realize its a Hardware issue in Ipad. Called customer service and  confirmed same...The shocking news is, I bought Ipad on Sep-10th and called customer service on 12th, they confirmed that there is no warranty for Ipad which I bought from Amazon. Technical support asked me to pay $199 for 1 yr ipad support(for any technical issue). Really all shocking things were happened in 2 days of having Ipad. So returning same and I hope nobody should get this issue again. Also lost hopes on buying any Apple product from online sites(other than Apple Inc).!###I was a bit hesitant to spend $300+ on a non-HD tablet, seeing as the Nexus 7 is only $199, but I'm very glad that I did. I am by no means an apple fanatic, I traded my iPhone 4 for a Galaxy Nexus and never looked back. However, the tablet ecosystem is much different than smartphones right now. I find myself using the iPad mini almost always over my phone now, aside from texting and calling. Here's my list of pros and cons:Pros:Fantastically smooth- seriously. You really don't need to compare android tablet specs with iPad's. The iPad will always have a lower clock speed and less ram, yet somehow perform beautifully and rarely have a hiccup. This has a dual core 1ghz, and my phone has a dual 1.2ghz. Yet, the iPad rarely skips a beat, while I have to occasionally kill apps or reboot my phone to keep its performance smooth.Battery is fantastic- I use this thing a LOT. Like, a few hours throughout the day. I blast music on the speakers, surf the web, tumblr, facebook, flipboard. Yet I only have to charge it maybe once every other day. I've played a half hour of music from the (also fantastic) speakers, and the battery moved 1%. It's great.The speakers are rich and loud as hell- I often used my roomie's laptop before I bought the ipad, and it worked. Now I have to use my ipad to listen to music, simply because it's louder and richer than the laptop speakers. And it's not a netbook, it's a standard 15.4 incher. The iPad mini is LOUD, in stereo. The bass even rocks. It's not extremely prominent, but it's a step up from the tinny wannabe bass from this laptop or my phone.Extremely easy to jailbreak- for the tinkerers out there. I love to tinker, thus the android phone I own. But with evasi0n jailbreak, you literally plug the iPad into the computer, hit a button, 5 minutes later, jailbroken.Slim, sleek, and light- This thing is a feat of technology, reminiscent of the first iPod nano. It just makes you think, how the hell did they fit all that into this tiny case? Holding the ipad mini for extended periods proves to be comfortable and painless, and it literally just slides into my backpack effortlessly when I'm traveling. I never wanted an iPad before, simply because they were too big, and 7 inch tablets were too narrow and small. This ipad gets it right.iPad specific apps- This is a big point in the android vs iPad wars. Android tablets are generally cheaper than iPads, with faster and higher capacity internals. On paper, they win over the iPad in every way. But where the iPad really outshines them is the apps. Many 7 inch android tablet apps are just scaled-up versions of their phone counterparts. But the iPad, being popular as it is, has developers writing entirely new versions of their apps specifically for the larger tab. And they look great. They're functional, convenient, and reliable. Apps like flipboard, youtube, and tumblr come to mind. Whereas on a Nexus 7, these apps are just scaled up (10 inch tabs get a tablet version of youtube, which is actually pretty cool though).UI (user interface)- Apple is known for taking simplicity and perfecting it for the masses. The iPad's UI is the pinnacle of their design. It just works, and it works well. Apps are organized in a 4x5 grid, with room for 6 on the dock at the bottom. The notification bar pulls down from the top just as it has since iOS5, and holding the home buttom gives you a nice greeting from siri. But the multitouch gestures are really where it shines. 4 fingers swiped up opens the multitasking bar. While in an app, 4 fingers swiped side to side switches between other open apps. And my favorite, 5 fingers pinched in at any point takes you back to the home screen. I had always griped about having to hit the physical home button, and this solves that issue. Also, swiping to the left of the multitasking bar gets you to quick settings, such as music control, brightness, volume, and orientation lock. Nifty.Cons:The non-retina display- Honestly, I think the only reason this bothers me is because my phone has a 720p HD display, which is becoming the norm these days, with high end phones getting 1080p this year. The screen isn't bad, it's bright and colorful. It's just not extremely crisp. It's especially noticeable when reading smaller text. I'm sure later this year Apple will find a way to cram a retina display in, and maybe I'll upgrade. But probably not, because it's honestly not that big of a deal in everyday use. The device is still an extreme pleasure to use. And this is my only con.Overall, I'd highly recommend the mini. It's a great tweener for the iPhone and full sized iPad. It's become my go-to device, and I really enjoy using it everyday. If you have the extra capital and are in the market for a reliable, responsive tablet, go for the iPad mini.!###Everyone else already covered the essential characteristics, features and functions of the ipad mini, so instead, I'd approach this review on a practicality basis to let you know how it works for me.Things I'd like to touch on are non retina, slower A5 processor, screen size, and physical build qualityLACK OF RETINA DISPLAYI've seen countless reviews of people complaining that the non retina display on the ipad mini is a pain to use and the fuzziness of texts is unbearable to read ...well...it's not!!!!! Yes the ipad mini screen display could've been a lot better and sharper than it currently is but to be honest, I think users of iPhone 4/4s/5, ipad3/4, and all other iDevices that currently use retina screens are just spoiled by being accustom to apple having retina that they have a state of mind that they won't accept anything less than retina quality from apple.A lot of other mobile companies have screens a lot worse than retina but yet still people accept it mainly because their expectations for the other brands aren't as high as what they'd expect from apple...people love the non retina MacBook Pros...and reading texts on that machine isn't a pain or unbearable right?I'd love to see retina on the next releases of the new ipad minis schedules for later this year but in the mean while, I'm pretty satisfied with the existing display...it's not great, but it's also far from being bad.A5 PROCESSORThis is the reason I took away 1 star from making this product earn a 5 star review....the major blow to me of this device is that it has an A5 processor and not that it lacks a retina display...for those who are unaware, the A5 chip comes with built in RAM which only has the capacity of 512mb...doing basic things on the ipad mini doesn't require an A5x or aA6 chip but with the more intense apps like Waze, graphic intense games, and even Facebook, you'd begin to experience some slow downs on your device...again, not unbearable, but definitely not a smooth experience as one would like.Is it a dealbreaker? If I'm relying on just specs on paper, then YES....however, if I'm basing my purchase of an ipad mini on actual use of the device forgetting specs and just seeing how the device works in real life situations...then NO...although the ipad mini only has 512mb of RAM it's not a slouch. iOS is very hardware efficient and you won't feel the lack of 1gb RAM on iOS as much as you would on an android device running jelly bean for example.SCREEN SIZEthis is honestly the best screen size I've experienced on any tablet thus far. You can easily type with both thumbs while holding the ipad mini in portrait mode (something that wasn't possible with the classic sized iPads unless you split the keyboard).A 7.9&#34; screen is a joy to carry around as its not too large and not too small neither. My sentiments are that 7&#34; is a little too small for a tablet as they're phones already close to that size such as the galaxy note series. At first I wasn't too sure how I'd feel about the extra .9 of an inch thinking to myself that it's not a significant amount of extra real estate to satisfy me seeing as I previously owned an ipad 3, but to my suprise, it's just the right size for my personal taste.I know you probably heard this countless times before but I too think that this should've been the size of the iPads all along as now that I own a mini, I'd never go back to that 9.7&#34; of the classic iPads...I find myself carrying around and using my ipad mini a lot more than I did with my ipad 3 even though it was faster and had a better display....this ipad mini simply is what a tablet is supposed to be....PORTABLE!!!PHYSICAL BUILD QUALITYThe ipad mini is a wonderful piece of hardware. Detail given by apple in the production of this machine is simply amazing. From the moment you hold it in your hands you'd feel the love and great R&D they put into this device. It does come with a few drawbacks but the pros by far outnumbers the cons.It is the nicest lookin ipad yet, best screen size in my opinion, best with regards to portability and it does everything it's bigger brothers do, a bit slower, but in real time it's only a few milliseconds slower though which to me is not substantial.Next gen ipad mini with a faster processor and retina screen WILL be the best ipad you can possibly get, but for now I'm pretty satisfied with the ipad mini and can safely recommend this device to anyone looking for an excellent, lightweight and portable tablet!###I placed an order for the iPad Mini 64 GB WIFI.  I ordered it from TechGiant.  The order was shipped promptly.  However, to my surprise, when I went to register the device to qualify for Apple's free one year warranty, I was informed that the device had already been registered by another user in 2012 and that I only had 119 days remaining in the warranty.  That might explain why the battery was 20% low when I plugged it in and it prompted me to restore files from iCloud.  I plugged the device in and the charger didn't even work.  I paid $519 for a device that was advertised as new but it was not.  I didn't have a way to contact the shipper so I contacted Amazon.  They instructed me to return the item for a refund.  They also gave me a link to try to contact the seller.  I called a phone number on the seller's website and left a message explaining the situation.  I stated I wanted to give them the opportunity to correct the problem.  This was a few days ago and I still have not received a return call from the seller.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed and still don't have an iPad Mini I need for a trip I have coming up.!###i bought this as a replacement for my wife's ipad 2. at first she wasn't sure about it but after playing with it and seeing for herself how it surpassed her old ipad she just loves it.. &#34;it is a great size&#34; her words for reading, she uses it for school, work and the occasional netflix viewing.. great item for the individual who wants super portability with the right size screen for reading and more...!###I held off buying the Mini because of all the reviews that rated my Google Nexus 7 tablet as far superior, but now that I have both, I believe it's the Mini that is better.  I think they are both great but here are the key deciding factors:For Mini:Screen size is better...you can see more without scrollingFor web browsing, it doesn't  default to mobile pages, always showing full sized pages which I preferGlass surface feels better to tap (strange but true)Charges much faster and charger fits more snugly into deviceHolds charge for a longer timeAgainst Mini:Screen resolution is crisper on Google Nexus 7Web pages load slightly faster on Google Nexus 7 in my side by side testSo while both are excellent, for me the Mini is better!!###I ordered this &#34;new&#34; product. When it arrived it was in an already opened box, it was not &#34;new.&#34; When I contacted the seller I was informed that the product hadn't been used that the box was only opened to ensure that everything was accounted for. Be warned that if you are expected a new sealed in factory packing product, this is not it.!###Great product!!!BUT are you willing to purchase this from these sellers at a 20% price increase, when you can get it directly, which it will ship in 2 weeks, for $329 for the 16GB.  Currently Apple is shipping them in two weeks!  In addition, you can customize the ones you get directly from Apple... putting a name or some other custom phrase that would mark it as YOURS for free!!!!!I say, order from Apple DIRECTLY!!!!###I cancelled this order two days after ordering because my son gave me one as a gift.  Worldwide Distributors told me it was too late to cancel, it was already being shipped.  It took me two weeks to get it.  Just as I received the package, Worldwide Distributors sent me an email asking me to check the serial number because they had received some defective products.  Their return instructions indicated to return the package unopened so I was unable to comply with their request and responded to their email reminding them I was returning this product.  They also require the package cannot be returned in the box received.  So it cost me $25 to put the package in another box and mail.  They received it on a Monday and said 5-7 business days to receive a refund.  I called 10 business days later and, fortunately, got a hold of someone named Fernando.  He was great and processed my refund the same day.  Amazon then took another 3 business days to apply the refund.  It is amazing how they can instantaneously take your money and it takes many days to refund it.  I would never purchase anything from this Worldwide Distributors again.  Who knows, if I had kept it, it may have been defective, then where would I have been?!!###The iPad does not work. I will need to get a new one.. Child wad dissapointed. Need to exchange. Help!###There is no incentive or need to buy this product. I have used once of these Ipad mini's several times and it is just another Ipad only smaller...whats next the revolutionary Ipad 6" Nano or the Ipad mini with retina display for 600 dollars? ROFL. If you have an Ipad already or have ever purchased an Ipad previously you already own a 10" version of the Ipad mini, there is nothing new or revolutionary about this device. For what this device is it's way over priced both on amazon and apple websites/store if they are trying to compete. Most other 7" tablets are selling for 100-250$ and for the most part they offer alot more functionality and bang for your buck than IOS or any Ipad let alone this mini one. This is just an effortless, pointless cash grab device. Not impressed with this or the Iphone 5 as again it's a pointless buy as a new one will be on the way within a year which will be the same phone recycled with more rounded corners. Maybe now that Jobs is gone so are Apple's "revolutionary" idea's *cough* magical marketing prowess.!###Yes, I bought it and it works exactly to the advantage of Apple company not me. Everything is limited and designed with company making money from me, customer. The unit does have choice between Wifi and 4G in theory--sure, but try to use it and suddenly you have to pay for Wifi access, hm. Ok.As in all Apple tablets the screen dont give you what regular laptop does but limit you to about half of all info. As with all tablets you dont have unlimited data and even lousy 5 gigs cost a fortune. Everything stricly limited to Apple and if you wanna download your own movie to memory--goodluck.A toy for grown ups.!###This thing looks like one of those Chinese imitations you buy on the side walks for like $20.1024x768 on a 8 inch screen. LOL hahahhaha. Might aswell go back to the days of black and white CRT TV from the 60's while we at this level.A Google Nexus 7 costs $229 on Amazon and has 1280x720 HD IPS on a 7 inch which brings the ppi up to 216 which is the level of the Samsung Galaxy S2 i9100.Who would be dumb enough to buy this outdated garbage for such high price and keep it? I don't know. Sending this garbage back asap!!!###I was waiting for something else... Maybe if I had received the correct one I would be happier. Normally I am really happy with Apple items and that's why I have iPhone iPod etc but seller sent the wrong one and now amazon blocked my account!! Thank you very much!!!!###Buyer Beware! No where in the product description does it say the product you receive may be used. Mine was. The back was scratched even though the ipad was packaged correctly. Not just one scratch but a group of them. In one small section there was a small gouge.I returned it to Amazon the same day it arrived and went to the Apple store to purchase the ipad mini.!###I have long used Kindle products (and I mean from first one on the market) and loved them.  I had checked out iPad several years ago and felt that the Kindle Fire was much better.  Recently purchased an iPad mini with 4G LTE  from another vendor to be able to use for a specific purpose - but was very surprised at the changes that have been made to bring the iPad  up to the standards of the Kindle Fire.  I would recommend purchase of the iPad mini.  I gave it a 4 star rating instead of 5 simply because of the cost.!###I have to admit, I've started to become an Apple fanboy. After my poor experience with the Nexus 7 I went with the overpriced iPad. I love my iPhone, but wasn't looking to essentially get a bigger version of it (with a wi-fi only model). While they are very similar devices, I have found unique uses for my iPad. First off, there are an excellent selection of apps, a huge advantage the App store has over Google Play. I have one for taking handwritten notes, organizing my notes, performing sit ups, scanning documents, reading articles, books, and comics, utilizing Google Drive, dating and playing some games. Android devices have many of these features, but not the quantity or quality.The iPad itself performs well. Switching between screens and using the new iOS 7 changes have been fine. Of course, there are some changes I do not like, but that's not particular to this machine. I prefer the mini sized iPad versus the normal size for holding and travel. It's light and doesn't take up much space. The screen is wonderful for reading and takes decent pictures.Overpriced it is, I still think it's a great tablet. When the iPad was revealed years ago I couldn't imagine anyone wanting one. Now owning one I understand the appeal.!###I'm a certified iOS geek.  I've owned every iteration of the iPhone and iPad that's ever come out.  In Black and White.  I wait online and install the system updates (now OTA) the minute they are released.  I tell you this so you will know that I'm really fond of Apple's iOS products.So when the iPad Mini came out, I had to get it to supplement my new, new iPad.  You know what?  It has just not excited me.  It's really not that the 1024x768 resolution is bad, after all, with a smaller screen size, the pixel density increases slightly, but its certainly discernible from the retina display of the new iPads.I just find that the form factor is not so significantly different that I'm amazed and delighted by how much I can do with a smaller device.  Nor am I bowled over by its price.  The stereo speakers are there, but no more noticeably louder than my full-sized iPad with only one speaker.  It's really just there.  In other words, it's more of the same and does not give me the satisfaction of an all-new device.  Now, as I mentioned, I love iOS, and the new betas for iOS 7 will definitely spark some more life into this device, but as I look back and forth between my new, new iPad and my new iPad Mini, all I can do is shrug and say, "Meh..."Besides a retina display, what can Apple do to make me espouse the iPad mini as "magical"?  It's not hard... I want a louder set of speakers (my wife's 7" Kindle Fire HD has a booming set of speakers), native apps that not only replace or duplicate the ones on a full size iPad, but rather supplement them so if the two units are together, the functionality increases.  For example, what if any two iPads placed next to each other could extend the screen size?  What if I could place my iPad mini next to my full sized iPad and during Facetime, the iPad mini could show my own face full screen while the large iPad showed the other person's (instead of it being in a little window)?  Finally, they should drop the price by another $50-$75 or, god-forbid, increase the new full sized iPads by $100 to differentiate the price points.Right now, this fanboy is not the world's biggest fan of the iPad mini.  Will I keep it?  Of course, but just until the next one is released.  I have to own each iteration of these devices after all.  However, am I feeling more than just a bit lured by the new Google and Asus tablets...? You'd better believe it.  I'm looking for different, newer, better, more innovative.  One more version, I tell myself... but for the time, I won't recommend an iPad mini if you already own the full-sized iPad.  It's a downgrade.UPDATE: February 2014Now that I also own the iPad Air and Retina iPad Mini, my conclusion is that Apple is starting to fall from grace.  The build quality of the devices continue to be among the industry's very best but innovation seems to have slowed to a near halt.  One more generation of iPhones, iPad and Apple TV for me coming up and if I'm no longer impressed, they will then have lost my business, but more importantly, my brand loyalty.  Having sunk thousands into the Apple ecosystem, I am now realizing they are no longer the company they were between 2007-2011.!###First off the advertising that was sent out on this device said over "275,000 Apps to choose from" that is incorrect - as I found out calling Apple tech support one day.Although they say they will "eventually" make them available to the mini - I believe it to be false advertising myself.Next is the considerable failure on its connectivity to anything other than a mac pc, I have had to remove apps, photos and music and had to reinstall them over more than once - without an explaination from Apple support this takes considerable time.Overall its more sleek and compact than the larger version of the IPAD - but for the amount of headache I've had from it - it will be sometime before I ever buy from Apple again.Their are certainly better and less expensive tablets on the market - ones that you will not have to pay extra once the battery life gives out on your IPAD - guess thats one way Apple can keep its "loyal" customers.!###I bought this iPad Mini for my wife because the grandchildren keep hogging my original iPad and my wife's iPad 2 (I got for her last year.).  So far, my wife has been able to keep her hands on the new Mini without the grandkids hogging it.My wife likes the Mini because:It runs the same apps as the iPad 2 does.It is smaller and fits on the table beside her chair better than the iPad 2 did.It is lighter than the iPad 2.  This is important because the OtterBoxes add significant weight to the iPads.  (We would never have an iPad without a case because of the risk of the grandchildren dropping them.)It works very well for what she does: FaceBook, Pinterest, searching the Internet and simple games.I like that it runs iOS 7 and the cameras are better than on the iPad 2.Much has been said about the low resolution of the screen on the original iPad Mini.  That is not a problem for us with the way we use our iPads.  I suppose if you used it for viewing a lot of videos, that might matter.  But, that is what we use our TVs for.The iPads have been very appreciated by the members of this household.  The grandchildren do use the larger iPads for videos and have not complained about the low resolution of the screens.  We currently have an iPad (1st generation), iPad 2, iPad 4th generation and the iPad Mini.  What we like about the iPads are the wide variety of apps available (many free ones) and the fact that they actually work.Prior to getting into the world of iPads, we had 3 different Android tablets which had a variety of problems:The Android tablets:Did not use Google Play.  Two of them required downloads from a PC to install apps.One had a resistive screen, which was hard to use.Two frequently froze up.  One had a reset hole an ear ring pin could be placed in.  The other simply had to be left alone for the battery to run down.While people complain about the iPads not accepting SD cards, we had problems with our Android devices not allowing all of the apps to be installed on the SD cards.We are very happy with all of our iOS devices (including 3 iPhones and 3 iPod Touches) because they work as they should.UPDATE:I forgot to state that I also especially like the new Lightning connector the Mini and the iPhone 5 has.  It is much easier to connect to the device than the old 30 pin connector or a mini USB connector that so many devices use.  With the Lightning connector, either side can be placed up when connecting to the device.  The old 30 pin can be difficult to connect without actually looking at the connector and device.!###Both of my children have high functioning ASD. I have been looking for educational tools to help them learn and function better as well as make their lives a little bit easier. I have tried puzzles, leapfrog, vetch products  and even a different off name tablet (which was a complete nightmare). I always wanted to stay clear of apple products because I know of many friends that had to Jailbreak their iPhones to get around Apples strict restrictions (not to mention price); so the ipad was my last resort. After my children's schools sent home numerous reports on how well my children were working with the ipad, as well as their occupational and speech therapists strongly suggesting apps that could only be found on the apple store I broke down and bought the ipad mini. I am very glad I did! Not only did I find great apps for them that they love, I found several for myself that has made biology class a breeze. I'm a bit disappointed that I couldn't get the blue tooth to work with my Android cell phone (another one of Apples restrictions I assume) but In my case I didn't buy this product for the blue tooth or its communication features. I bought this product as a learning tool and it has done the job. :)!###I love my iPad Mini.  I was using my iPhone for everything you can imagine and it was draining my phone battery.  Whenever I got a call, it would kick off my game or whatever app I was running.  Now that I have the iPad, I pretty much only use my phone as a phone and I can talk while still using my apps.  Another thing I noticed while using my iPhone was the considerable amount of eye strain it was causing.  The larger screen on the iPad mini is perfect.  I also like the size of the mini versus the regular iPad.  It's small enough to tote around with me where ever I go and it sits nicely on the couch arm if you have a case that props it up.  I highly recommend the iPad if you want a larger gaming area for games such as Hay Day and Candy Crush.!###The ipad mini was just like new in very excellent condition. It was delivered very fast. I use the Ipad on a daily.!###Like the convenience of the mini. It has been all that I expected.  The size meets my needs.  Battery life has been fairly good.!###I am very much pro iPad.  I owned a 1st and now a 4th generation standard versions.  As a tablet there is no better choice.I recently tested out the mini, and while it has all the same amazing features as the standard, I have to say I do not prefer the smaller size.  I get that people need something more portable, and for you this might be a great choice.  I however use mine for watching videos when I am out and about, so I found myself missing the screen size.If you need something more portable and just smaller, then get this, otherwise go get the 4th generation iPad.  Honestly though, either way you will be happy.!###I received my iPad mini on Sept. 20.  I had a software question so I contacted Apple Support for help.  They told me that my 90-day Apple new-buyer support had already terminated.  They said it had already been registered 3 months earlier by someone else.  That tells me that I was sent a used iPad and was charged a new iPad price.  Now I cannot use Apple Support if I have a problem in the next 90 days.  Also, my 12-month warranty has been reduced to 9 months.  I feel somewhat cheated and I hope this doesn't happen to another customer.  Next time I will buy Apple products from the Apple Store.!###The iPad Mini manufactured by Apple has been the best purchase I have made so far in electronics. A 7.9 inch display touch screen, my iPad Mini is white but it is also available in black glass from and a aluminum back. It has cameras built in the front & back. The way it sounds when it plays music its great, its very loud but it also has an headphones jack build in so when you want to listen to music just to yourself. This device is so easy to carry around it only weights 10.9 ounces compared to other device that is very lite, its almost like your caring just a lite reading book. It has other great features like over 275,000 apps to download from the app store, Face Time where you can video call someone from any other Apple device and much more. Compared to other tablets like the Galaxy Tablet 2, Kindle Fire and even the iPad 2 that's manufactured by the same company I think the iPad Mini is the best. Starting with the Galaxy tablet, it has some features that are the same as the iPad Mini but not all. The Galaxy Tablet 2 is manufactured by Samsung it has a 10.1 screen, its a black colored tablet, weights 1.28 lbs that's 0.59 pounds more than the iPad mini. The only good thing it might have better than an iPad mini it is its battery lifetime, an iPad mini can hold up to 10 hours and an Galaxy Tablet 2 holds up to 14 hours. Every other feature the iPad has better. Second tablet to compare the iPad Mini to is the Kindle Fire. The Kindle is a 8.9 in display screen, it weights 20 ounces, storage varies on amount you want from 16GB to 32 GB. While iPad had an storage amount that goes from 16GB to 64GB this shows that the iPad has more storage available than the Kindle. Yes it has a few similarities as the iPad mini but the app store in the kindle is not the best, it has a few selections to choice from. Another thing to know about the Kindle is that this tablet is more of a online book reading tablet. Third tablet to compare it to is the iPad 2, a tablet that was made by the same manufacturer. An iPad mini is better than the iPad two in many different ways. One example is its weight the iPad mini weights 10 ounces while the iPad 2 is weighting at 1.22 pounds. Less weight is always better, you don't want to carry a device that's to big because then you'll get tired faster. The manufacturer comes up with an improvement in their tablets for a reason. The iPad mini came out after the iPad 2 but was a better success. Another example is Sire If you don't know what that is Siri is a feature that lets you use your voice tell it to do things like send messages, place phone call and other things. Size was a big change in the manufactures design in the iPad mini, they made it smaller and more portable for the buyers.  As you can tell the iPad mini is a better and improved tablet that apple manufacture has build after iPad 2. I have purchased the iPad mini and I'm so happy that I've purchased such a wonderful device. I've had such bad experience with tablets. They either are too big, heavy and there aren't much apps to choose from. But I've had best experience with this device it is so easy to work, I have many apps to choose from and its very lite to carry. I totally love the camera pixels, my pictures and videos are so clear. I paid a little bit over $300 dollars for my iPad mini but it was worth every penny. I recommend anybody that is going to buy a tablet to get an iPad mini. I know for a fact they will not regret it because I don't. This iPad mini is with me at all times and it's useful. I take it with me to class, its features let me take notes and save them when I don't feel like writing them on paper or when I don't have a utensil to write with. When it comes to me to remembering things I'm not the best at. But being able to use the iPad mini's Calendar is useful, I can type in reminders of events or anything that needs to be done on a certain day to remind me. There is so much that you can do with the iPad mini that its so amazing. I remember when I was running to class late I was rushing putting things in my backpack not realizing that I had forgot the most important thing for that class, the reading book. I arrived to class, I sat down I began taking out my things that's when I realized that I forgot my book on my bed. I didn't know what to do the teacher was very strict on being prepared for class, she didn't like people sharing books. As I was pulling my iPad mini I thought about an idea. I turned on my WiFi and began to browse the internet looking for an online book I was able to find one. I was so happy the iPad mini saved me. If it wasn't for that iPad mini I would have been lost in class and the teacher would have made me look like a fool in front of the class if she would have seen me not participating and not having a book. Thank you iPad mini.!###I purchased the iPad Mini for myself for relatively light gaming, and school purposes as I am a college student. I have to say, I am very pleased with this product as it is perfect for a student who is constantly on the go, like myself. It&#8217;s thin, light weight, and very portable. It fits perfectly in my purse (even with a Defender Series Otterbox on it) and keeps its charge through my school day MUCH better than my laptop!The only minor drawback is, if you&#8217;re like me and have an iPhone, you&#8217;re going to see a noticeable difference in the crispness of the display. I never had a regular sized iPad, but from what I understand, the reason the images aren&#8217;t as perfect is because the iPad Mini doesn&#8217;t have the retina display. Again, to me this was a really minor drawback, and it doesn&#8217;t change my 5 star rating. I also had a strange problem getting my iPad Mini to connect to my Apple iTunes account so I could use iMessage and FaceTime. The problem somehow solved itself about 24 hours after activating it&#8230; Not sure what the problem was, but it hasn&#8217;t been an issue since.I also just updated it with the new iOS 7 software, and it looks and operates perfectly! No glitches so far, and it&#8217;s looking like there won&#8217;t be any!I would definitely recommend this product to college students who - like me - are tired of carting around their laptops, only to have the battery die in the middle of class!!###Coming from an iPad 3 (retina display). Love the Mini's small size but definitelynot the low-resolution display.Got used to the fantastic iPhone 4 and iPad 3 displays, therefore returned the Mini andwaiting for the version with retina display (early 2014?)...!###I bought this as a surprise for my wonderful husband and he simply loves it and has not put it down since it was delivered!###This I pad mini is great, what I like most is suri is on it and she knows she's the s***.!###It was not clear that the iPad mini has no 3G.I brought to Brazil and, surprise, there is no 3G slot.Maybe you should be more clear regarding this and consider that AMAZON sells beyond US, so, communication should include an international perspective.Aylmer!###I ordered a white mini ipad, and the package i recieved has a black mini ipad.  very disappointed because i dont have time to return iteam were flying this weekend and needed a ipad quickly to download movies and games on for two toddlers.!###we did not receive our purchase! the box was not taped shut and arrived empty. We since sought and got a refund and bought an iPad Mini through Apple direct and thoroughly love this product.!###Nothing revolutionary or innovative about making an iPod Touch bigger.I will stick with my Nexus 7..Sorry Apple but that's how it is.!###The description was misleading it said it had a Simm port in Additional description.The store needs to check what info is on it!###ok, to start of with, i have never bought a apple product in my life. so when i got this i wasn't sure of what to expect. so i unboxed it and was a little perplexed by the things inside. Obviously it came with the ipad and charger, and instructions and stuff. i was just about to throw away the box until a flash of light caught my eye inside the box.stickers.in the shape of a apple. I immediatly threw all the other stuff down and grabbed the stickers( which cracked the screen of the ipad:( ). i was just amazed by the worksmanship of those stickers. i was so amazed by them, i even gave them a name. jagsby. me and jagsby ended up going to the movies together and watched startrek. then we got bored so we decided to use the power glove i had to go through time and beat some people up. but on one of the people had a kniife and was about to stab me, but jagsby blocked it resulting in him getting cut. this made me so angry i killed the man with my d1c6. he died from a snapped brain stem and not being able to process the godly powers of my d1c6.i teleported back to my time with jagsby, but it was too late. he was gone. i'll never forget jagsby. he was my best friend. but. the 530 bucks was worth it, but only for the stickers. i wouldnt recomend the ipad. he cant lift!###What's not to like about this cute iPad mini.  Well-designed, packed full of features, perfect size for easy carrying in purse.!###I debated for a month between the Kindle, Android options and the IPad mini.  I knew from the minute it arrived that we made the right choice.  Satisfaction level with the product gets better and better the more we get to know the device (the only Apple product we own).!###I can't say enough about this Mini Marvel! It is feather light, yet as full featured as my iPad 2 - only faster. And, as with all Apple products I have purchased over the years, it is totally reliable and the fit and finish is second to none! What I don't understand is why anyone would buy an Apple product from Amazon. I guess a lot of customers are used to really low prices on the products they carry, but in the case of Apple, you are paying more than you would literally anywhere else in the US! Why would you do this to yourselves? Check out Apple.com first to see what a particular product should sell for, and then go to a reputable Authorized Apple Reseller, such as B&H Photo or MacConnections for the best price. Buy it here and you will be ripped off - mercilessly! CAVEAT EMPTOR.!###I was hesitant to purchase the ipad mini from a dealer because there were only stock pics and limited description but I'm very happy I took the chance. First, I contacted the seller to ask a question and they replied the same day with an answer so 5 stars for communication. Second, the product arrived in it's original box with the serial number of the device matching the packaging, this exceeded my expectation. Accessories were neatly stowed as if they had never been used. I could find no blemishes on the ipad mini, it looked like new. I took it by my local Apple store to have them check it out and they confirmed that it was like new. They were also able to look it up and tell me when it was originally purchased (Nov) and they registered it to me.I've been using the mini for a few weeks now and I love the size for convenience. It's extremely thin and fits in my purse. I had the Nook Tablet before this and find that they are very similar in size. I also have the iPad 3 and for regular use, I prefer the larger screen. I wanted the mini for travel and it will be perfect. Everything I have on my iPad 3 can be put on my mini so when I travel, I have everything I need. I bought the 32 gig and I currently have 7 full length movies and 25 tv episodes (40+ min each) in addition to 130 songs and 84 apps of which 16 are games so it holds quite a bit of entertainment. I have a little over 2 gigs available. My iPad 3 has 64g so I was worried I'd miss the space.The mini feels much more thin and delicate than my iPad 3 and my Nook Tablet. I worry about it breaking and wish LifeProof had a case out for it. In portrait view, the sides are narrow so holding it just there can be precarious. I let it lay on my palm with my thumb on the narrow edge for more support. The screen size is satisfactory and I've had no screen issues while watching movies. Many say if you are used to the retina display then this will disappoint but I don't have that problem. Movies display in wide width with the ability to increase the size to full screen by zoom. Sound is excellent. Alone it is fine on 5-6 level and with other noise, 7-8 is fine. Camera works with ease and seems to have the same functions as my iPad 3 including front facing camera, zoom and video. Apps made for the iPhone can be increased in size but a little visual quality is lost due to pixelation. IPad apps look great. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the product and the seller. I recommend and would definitely purchase again.!###Man this is an amazing product. Its better than the iPad, I would say. It's much easier to handle because it is not as bulky as the iPad. I feel that I don't even need a laptop anymore. With all the apps out there, I don't think we will be needing laptops pretty soon. This product makes your life easy.Compared to the regular iPad, the mini is light!!!  Now that i take a look at the ipad i think its way too heavy and uncomfortable, makes the mini feel like a feather. Hands down!!###I  made the mistake of purchasing the iPad mini, mainly because it was more compact to fit in a briefcase. It had great reviews & such, so figured it would be a functional tablet. And it probably is for playing games, music and things like that. But it is really lacking as a tool to use in business.The iPad mini, & I have no reason to believe the iPad is any different, comes without an office suite, a way to easily transfer files from a PC unless you use the Cloud or the iTunes Utility, which for security reasons cannot be used in my business, & few apps are without a cost. In this world, people often have multiple platforms at work & home. Even in the app store, there is no direct link to business apps. You must search for everything. With lots of time, searching & frustration at times, the tablet is now functional. I will not go into the lack of multitasking & other small inconveniences.Trying to get a manual for this unit was another treat! You would think it would be included on the desktop as a PDF file. Every Web search to find a User Manual lead you to links to other sites wanting you to download their PDF, Anti Virus or some other tool bar software. When I finally found a manual but it was specific to the iPad even though the internet search said it was a manual for the iPad Mini. Still haven't found anything very specific to the iPad Mini that I own. I will use the iPad with iOS 6 manual and hopefully it covers everything if there are differences. With Android Tablets it is just a matter of searching for the word pdf and the tablet and up comes your manual. Apple has to tie everything into collateral sales by linking with everyone.Paired with a Bluetooth keyboard, it is easy to put in data & I would recommend adding one. I also find a stylus works better than a finger on this tablet. Thankfully I got the 64G mini or would be in trouble since it is not expandable with a Micro SD card. Bad for consumers who have to pay more for this & only good for Apple's bottom line.I could go on about the iOS vs others, etc. but it comes down to having setup & used a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 in a few hours & I saw how easy it was to use, I would never recommend an iPad Mini over the Galaxy Note 10.1 for business use if your business is Windows centric rather than Apple based. Transfers of data is painful when you want to share between the two operating systems.!###We purchased a 1st generation iPad Mini to test some of our websites. With the exception of a shiny white iMac computer, and older 30 gig iPod  we are a Windows centric business. I have access to an older Pandigital android tablet, Kindle Fire, Asus RT, Acer W500 running WIndows 8.1 pro and WIndows 8 phone.Yes, the iPad was easy to learn but I have been working with computer technologies since 1977. The build quality good but not any more impressive than that of my Asus RT tablet and the Dell Venue Pro 8 I worked with for a few days. My hat off to Apple for getting folks to accept a consumption device that does not support flash or something as simple as downloading MP3 files from sites other than iTunes. I spent $4.95 for a browser app that supports flash. In all my years of using computers, this is the first time I have felt compelled to buy a browser!If I want to view and hear a YouTube video posted in the Facebook app, I must display it in Safari. The Apps store and iTunes take an exceptionally long time to load. I had to add an app just to be able to download our MP3 files! Speech commands and dictation require you be on line for Siri to connect with Apple servers (shades of Chromebook dependency on a Wi-Fi connection.) We all know how "secure" our internet data is so why not? (cough, cough) In Windows 8 tablets,the free built-in Microsoft Speech to text and control software is designed for off line as well as on line use.Even after adjusting font size options, screen print is often too small to read comfortably and zoom does not always work. Wi-Fi is slower than any other portable device I own. I can't argue against success but am dumbfounded such a limited device with an equally impressive high price has become the tablet standard. I am spoiled by tablets that allow full access to flash sites, true off line accessibility and file downloads. True, the Windows apps store is limited but I don't need many of the Apple apps that add functionality built-in to my other devices.Apple and Jobs deserve my  profound admiration for the amazing success of what I consider to be an exceptionally limited, overpriced device. Bravo.!###Pro's1.Brilliant design2.Great battery3 Tremendously light and portable4.Extraordinary brushed metal design Con's1.Smaller touch targets2.No retina display3.Expensive compared to other products4.No boxed headphones or dock adapter.!###I bought this one for my mom since I couldn't afford the full size one. She LOVES IT!!! She loves the size and she is always using it. This was the best gift I have ever given her.!###I wouldn't know cause I haven't gotten it yet but I'm sure it's amazing! My shipment ended up getting lost so good luck to anyone else searching for this.!###too bad,power is very slowly, and it will be more cheaper, so suggest don't buy it now.you can wait and can buy in another web site!###The &#34;refurbished&#34; IPAD miini came to me in a dusty old box.  The ipad mini was obviously dropped and had a chip.  I couldn't believe any was refurbished.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.!###Fell off my dresser and killed my mom. Then my baby choked on it. Stay away if you love your mom and babies!###Because the individual that we purchased the refurbished ipad from did not remove their account, we cannot use the ipad.  It is locked and we cannot seem to unlock it.  Since we bought several, we are not sure which seller belongs to this particular ipad. Sad that we wasted $250.00.!###Didn't receive the iPad Miini... Enjoy the 400 bucks jerk. And no tracking information was given with no responding to questions!###I thought I'd try Apple because everyone says how wonderful it is! I hated it. Samsung makes a far superior product for less!!! 8 inches and $249 and has more bells and whistles then the overrated ipad! Glad I returned it!!!!###The ipads have not shown up but the the credit card has been charged  How do you contact someone live!!!!!###The iPad mini is just perfect! I'm in love with the size and design of Apple's new version of the iPad.I'm in the Marines and when we're deployed, a light pack is a must and we face a lot of down-time. I had the iPad before and when I saw the iPad mini come out I had to give it a shot.I purchased the Apple iPad mini 32GB WIFI + cellular while in Afghanistan and it has been a perfect addition to my pack. It's light weight, I can fit it in my cargo pocket and 32 GB of space is plenty for my favorite TV shows and movies as well as all of my iBooks (20+) and days upon days of music to listen to while on the go.It's capable of everything the iPad was but it fits in one hand comfortably and typing on it is a breeze compared to stretching those thumbs across the screen like on the original iPad. I'd recommend this product to those looking to purchase their first tablet or those with an iPad looking to upgrade.**UPDATE**Cons:1. There isn't a retina version of the iPad mini, it shares the same characteristics of the normal size iPads other than the design and the power connector.2. Apple is likely to come out with an upgraded iPad mini in the Summer with retina so prepare to be behind the power curve as far as tablet technology.!###What a great toy . I still am trying to figure out how to work the many features. Love to Skype my grandkids and watch old movies on Netflix. Have not figured out how to download my video documentaries. The movie camera feature is a real blast. This might be the gadget made for us old folks. I bought the mini ipad hoping to find a replacement for my old Zune. It is on the road to extinction as I am and I wanted a device to store my library of video documentaries. I would watch these videos while waiting on my wife while visiting her many doctors. I bought a Kindle Fire but it did not have the capacity for storage. It looks like the Mini ipad will fill the bill. I would like to watch movies from Netflix and Amazon but the doctors' offices are not rigged up for waiting spouses' comfort as yet. As soon as I can figure out how to configure the format for my videos for the mini ipad I will be really happy with my purchase.!###i loved it! light as a kindle but with all the functionality of iPad 2. surprised becausei thought this was just a quick way to sell more tablet but there is a good use for this smaller form factor.love it!!###I've owned the iPad 2 for more than a year now. I use it everyday mostly for reading. I've tried many games on it and found the game experience to be wanting.iPad mini changes everything.Before taking the Mini home, there were things I obviously liked, and some things I was a little worried about. For instance, although you can hold the Mini with no effort because of how light it is, I heard talk that comic books were harder to read because of the smaller size.i haven't found this to be true. After reading several comics, I am very pleased with the experience.And games - all those games I couldn't quite get into because of the size of the larger iPads have now been opened up to me. The lightness of the mini, combined with the positioning of your hands on it's smaller frame have changed the experience. The thin bezel at the sides has proven to be plenty wide enough for me. The same games I tried on the larger iPad 2 are now much more enjoyable on the iPad mini. A big enough screen to enjoy the action, but not so big as to introduce awkwardness.Oh, also the speakers on the Mini are great. You will not be straining to hear what's going on in the videos you watch and games you play, unlike the iPad 2 experience.Throw in Siri and a respectable camera, and the iPad mini is the defining iPad experience in my opinion. I don't even miss not having retina, as some theorized would be the case.Do yourself a favor and get at least the 32 gb size. You don't want to continuously have to delete stuff in order to make room. Also, iPads slow down when they start getting low on memory. 32 gb will give you plenty of room for lots of stuff to enjoy, while leaving enough room so your iPad doesn't get bogged down.!###ABOUT THIS REVIEWERI'm a Prime Amazon customer. In this household we use Amazon to shop for all sorts of things.  I am an early adopter and love tech, but as we have come to rely on technology more and more, it has become less of a toy and something that simply has to work all the time, whether for an online web conference or for the kid's homework.ABOUT THE iPAD MINIConstruction: I was getting ready to write this review and managed to set my iPad mini on a bar-height kitchen counter top precariously, and it fell to the floor.  Hitting a wood floor no less.  Happy to report nothing happened. No scratches, no dings, operating just fine.  Didn't plan to start by writing about the construction of the iPad mini, but this is a device you'll move around a lot, take in the car, stuff in airplane seat pockets, cram into backpacks.  This thing is amazingly light, but built like a tank.  It can take it.Use: It is a joy to use.  Clear screen, easy operation, all the features work all the time... And of course you can find an application for just about anything.  Here is the best part, if you have more than one Tablet around (we have a couple iPads in the household), everything works the same way on the regular and the mini sized iPads.  Even better, using one account shared on these devices means that we only have to purchase an App once and we can use it on a couple different iPads.Choices: My wife prefers the larger iPad for email and my teens like the larger one for movies and drawing, but I love this mini size for travel.  It's just personal preference.  You can argue specs all you want, but basically the mini and the regular sized iPads are identical in function, battery life, apparent resolution, and so forth. The only question is your own preference as to size and weight. (And the Mini is less expensive than the full size.)Apps: Email is a breeze, web browsing is simple and quick, and if you are into photography, this little gem offers an amazing still shot and video camera. And with all those apps it can be just about anything from a network diagnostic tool to a book collection, from a banking tool to a game pad, or a weather forecaster to a music player...COST OF OWNERSHIPWhen it comes to picking a Tablet, think about the purchase price over time. I have PC netbooks in the house that lasted less than a year.  Most of the PC laptops lasted 2 years or so.  But the Apple products simply don't quit.  We have an original iPad that is as good as new, and Apple desktops and laptops that keep getting handed down from one family member to another because they don't stop.  Yes, they are more expensive to purchase at first, but we save a huge amount of money because they keep working for years and years.  We don't have money to waste, that's for sure.TOTAL ECOSYSTEMAnd here is the real decision point, at least for this household.  It's all about the ecosystem, or the suite of hardware and software that work together.  I'm no longer content to have a cool laptop, or a great Tablet.. I want it all working together, and this is where Apple products shine. We have personal and family calendars that update on our phones, tablets, desktops and laptops.  We do the same with email and magazine subscriptions and so much more.  We can share photos and music on all of these devices and on the TV as well (hooked to an Apple TV box). We can save files "in the cloud" and access them from anywhere, anytime, on any device.  This is how it is supposed to work.  My son is into programming and finds the Unix-based environment of the Mac to be the best place to work.  My daughter is into photography and has professional-level tools at the ready.  My wife is doing genealogy research and helping the kids with school (and life in general), and I have a company to run.  It's all on this integrated, connected, suite that works all the time, without nearly any effort from me to keep it running. And backups?  All automatic and all in the cloud, and yes, I've had to recover from backups before and it worked like it was supposed to.As I said at the start, we use Amazon Prime all the time. Love it. But I want the technology in our household to be what we want it to be, not a constant reminder to buy more.  Really disappointed that Amazon created their Kindle Fires as a way to sell more stuff. And yes, you can turn off the adds (by paying to do so), but not the recommendations. Beyond that, though, the Kindles and Kindle Fire are not part of an overall solution that can work together.SAFE and STABLEWe used to be a PC household, but that required 10 to 15 hours of month of "tech support" time from me to keep the computers and laptops and network operating.  No longer. It just works.  I also appreciate that the UNIX backbone of the Mac OS is less susceptible to viruses and the like. I don't have time to worry about the problems that Android phones are having now with viruses or hackers either.  True, all platforms can be attacked, but we are dealing with orders of magnitude here; the Apple world is more locked down, but in return I get more stability and we spend less time making it all work.CUSTOMER SUPPORTBack to this theme of saving time.  I love the fact that I can open up my iPad or my laptop and reserve an appointment at my local Apple Store with a few clicks.  Walk in the store, have the person up front confirm my arrival and be working with a decent tech person in just a few minutes.  I've had nothing but great service, and several times they went well beyond: as with older machines that were way past warranty but fixed at no charge, or the time I had an iPhone with a scratched camera lens. Replaced on the spot, no charge. If you are honest with them, they will be with you.So, that's our story.  Hope this has been useful for you in some way.!###love it and paid $329.00 plus tax = 348.74 from the Apple store! ITS A awesome product for sure i have all apple products as well  only way to go  thanks!###My husband bought this for me when it first came out because I own most things Apple. Despite my being a huge Apple fan, I wasn't sure I'd put this to good use. In the past month I've really come to love this thing.First off, while this does not have the advanced retina display of the iPad3, it produces a very clear and crisp image. It makes this the perfect device to use as an ereader because it can be held in one hand, yet it has the full functionality of a full size iPad minus advanced retina display.The speedy processor makes this lightening fast and unbelievably responsive and zippy. I use this just as I use my iPad2 and that means I can use it not just recreationally but also for some vital business functions. Like my iPhone, it keeps me in touch with my mail as well as the net while being easier to manipulate. If an app works on the iPad it will work on the Mini..I like the screen size which is just about perfect for a portable device that can fit in my hand and in a smaller purse. In fact, one of the reasons my husband popped for this is because it is comparable in size to a Kindle and is really portable and does not require a special carrying case, etc.The iSight camera, at 5 megapixels, is great. Produces clear and vivid pictures without any distortion.The all aluminum body is solid and the mini's construction is flawless. It is razor thin and weighs in well under a pound.I like the Lightening connector, but that does have a downside in that this is not interchangeable with the 30 prong connector that powers all of my other devices except the iPad4.Another new feature I like is SIRI. All you have to do is depress the screen button to activate SIRI which functions as a personal assistant. I'm still learning how to use it, but it is great to be able to access information with verbal commands.My only real complaint re: the mini is its price. It seems about $50 to $75 too high for what it is and how it compares to other tablets out there. Still, if you are a happy Apple user you'll pay the asking price.Ideally, this is best utilized by people on the go. It really suits my lifestyle since I am usually all over the place. Since there are hot spots everywhere I go, it is never a problem to find free wi-fi.I am updating my review nearly three months later. I really love this baby iPad. I'd be hard pressed to say whether I'd toss my iPad4 or my mini if I had to make a choice. I also have come to view the mini's price as fair given its quality and ease of operation. Of late, my Mini has gone everywhere with me. It is so compact, convenient, and discrete that it adds no appreciable weight to my purse and I can even carry a smaller purse now.  I love this thing. It makes me smile a lot.!###I ordered this device and received it promptly but it started having issues with the touch screen. I sent an email to Amazon to the seller about it but have not received any response. The device is useless without the touch screen. It only responds to touch about 1/4 of the time. Can't use the onscreen keyboard as it's pretty hard to use when it doesn't respond to touch. Don't buy Apple products via Amazon/This seller. Go to Apple instead to get working product.!###I had my first experience with Apple products only 3 years ago when I was handed down a old iPhone 3G. I couldn't believe what I'd been missing! Since them I've owned an iPhone 4s, Nano, iPad 2 (which I wouldn't be caught without) and most recently, after replacing the screen on my 4s twice already( it's broken again)- a new iPhone 3G to tide me over until my upgrade.Id rather have an old Apple device than consider the competitors.My daughter recently stepped on and cracked my iPad 2 so I decided to go with the mini as replacement. But only after considering a Microsoft Surface. I'm a student.I couldn't have picked a better Christmas present for myself.It's is larger than I expected and honestly, I prefer the smaller- than- iPad size. I don't long for a bigger screen like I had expected to.The image quality is also much better than I expected given that it doesn't have the retina. It SEEMS crisper than my old iPad. Is it my imagination?In Apples defense, I have yet to behold the retina display everyone raves about. But you can't missed what you've never had is my moto. The only reason I even considered the Retina is for the extra ram...This iPad isn't as snappy as as my iPad 2, but I expected that because I read the reviews...don't hate me...it's true!It's much like the difference in the 3G and 4S. Even my downloaded games lag.It is NOT just a wifi issue.Its smaller thus less powerful. It's not the iPad fault. You appreciate it for what it is. And I do.I was pleasantly surprised to have Siri back as I'd forgotten that the newer iPads support her. Nice!I can't go over the technical specs because I'm not THAT savvy. But as an iPad user, someone who considered my iPad 2 a necessity, I feel I have insight. It's a wonderful device to own and I came back to it in the end after considering others.I love my new iPad mini. Besides being more portable and more comfortable, I am glad to ditch the extra breakable surface area! It is nearly perfect, the king of 7&#34; tablets.PLEASE PEOPLE, PROTECT YOUR DEVICES! Sleek and light very seldom equals sturdy! I bought the protection plan and a good case. You should too.!###I bought the IPAD for my daughter, who resides in Minneapolis, however, she did not like the IPAD and sent it back to me, According to my daughter, the IPAD did not contain the features she wanted, I do not know anything about IPADs so I would not know what features she likes, however, I tried to return it for something different, but was told that I can not return it because it was opened, so I told the amazon.com credit card company that I was not going to pay for something that I could not use and because it was opened.  You cannot tell if you can used something unless you try it out, you certainly cannot tell by looking at the item, also, there should be a tag on the item stating that once opened you can not return it, had that been the case I would not have purchased the item, also, had there been a return item tag stating "once this Item is open it cannot be returned" prior to putting the item in the cart I would not have purchased the item.  One should not have to search for the Return Button to determine the condition for returns, because when I buy I do not expect to return.  One thing for sure if cannot return this item I any by business associates will never purchase anything from Amazon again.  SUGGESTION: RETURN POLICY SHOULD BE POSTED NEXT TO THE ITEM or AT TIME OF CHECK, A customer should not have to go Click on the RETURN BUTTON to find out the return policy!###FYI-Buyer beware Apple products SUCK and I would not accept one as a gift. Ipad FROZE when connected to itunes (Apple software) after selecting check for update. So called genius says in order to unfreeze I have to restore it to factory settings and loose every single photo, video and app. All because Apple infected it with an update. Can't wait for my Droid mini to arrive...to hell with Rotten APPLE.!###L2D2 takes upto 40% off the price if you return the product.  They expect you to try the product without removing the shrink wrap. How do they expect one to see the screen (which it turns out that the ipad mini has a vastly inferior screen to an ipad which i own) with the plastic wrap on.Even Apple allows you to play with the ipad mini for 14 days to decide on whether you want to keep it.L2D2 was prompt in replying but all they said was their return policy was clearly stated. If you call not being stated on the first screen of the product info as clear then their intention is also as clearAlso just go to their website and enjoy the 5 pages of return policies.  5pages i kid you notL2D2 thinks customer service is not important obviously.  A shame.!###This thing is a piece of shizzzle! Nothing stays open  long enough to type a word,for sure going back! Do not buy!!!!!###yes sir i just want to know if this is open box  coz there is something line on the screen once i opened it!###when I used my mini ipad easily seen that the system hangs and I have to reset at least twice a day since my youngest widely used interactive games.I did not like because of this.!###I am very shocked on how annoying this company can be and difficult. I believe this piece of hardware to be in adequate and shouldn't be purchased it. Apples awful excuse of a processor sucks and it is fairly slow. My apple account keep switching. I would much prefer android over this trash.!###It is ok I am so used to my androii that apple is not good for me!!!

Beware the Ipad Shop.!###So disappointed with this transaction.  I was eagerly awaiting my white iPad Mini that I ordered and they sent a black one with a label over the description so I didn't realize I had the wrong product until I opened up the box.  I tried to order another but it was getting so complicated and close to a trip that I wanted to use the iPad on, I just returned it and purchased the correct item at Walmart where I instantly received it and it was cheaper too!!###Not sure what they were thinking here because it renders the device basically unusable.However, there is a camera that I use to take pictures of my cats.  I cannot figure how to get them off the device so as a workaround I display the photo I want on screen and take a picture of the screen with a Kodak disposable camera and get the pictures developed at Walgreens.  Works like a charm, hence the 5 star review.!###Hello, I want to buy the ipad mini to bring Venezuela, I do not know if you can use it with different phone operators which are named there. my phone operator is movistar.!###My Ipad mini arrived at my door with a completely shattered screen and broken glass in the box. For spending over 300$ on an item, this is ridiculous. This was the last of the used versions so I cannot get a replacement for it.!###Too small, No hard copy instruction book!wish I could trade it for a kindle fire hd. Hate it hate it!###Of course we all love the item but I was very disappointed that these 2 mini iPads I ordered were just left at the door on the floor I don't live in the suburbs so I was clearly upset that they didn't require a signature at the door for these pricey items. Anyone could have stole them so that makes me mad that Amazon didn't require a signature I am an honest person so I didn't report that I never received them.!###The quality of the screen on this tablet for this price is really poor.  Text looks really bad on it compared to other "mini" tablets that are a lot cheaper.  I am staying with my nexus 7.  When I used the ipad mini the text seemed a lot worse then my nexus 7 which is 40% cheaper.  The aspect ratio is 4:3 which is not good for video, low resolution, low pixel desnity, no gps.!###Not only does it crop the pics, especially Facebook. Every app seems to be a preview and you have to pay to get a full version, unlike the Android version. I will never buy a I product again. Pretty good camera though.!###I don't get it why is this company charging $389 when you can buy everywhere else for $329. Simple price gouging if you ask me!###Very pleased, great tool , however, wish I had opted for a wifi plus 4g model for traveling. .. Next time.!###I just opened up my new iPad mini and I have to say I really love it! I am a huge Apple fan seeing as I also own a MacBook Pro and an iPhone so I was already very familiar with the iPad's interface and software. What's great is the fact that Apple makes it so easy to download and manage all your media between their various products. I proceeded to sync all my music, movies and games/apps onto it and then came the fun part: testing everything out. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the speakers especially for a tablet. The sound was loud and crystal clear. Movies look absolutely gorgeous even on this model which DOES NOT have the retina display. Since I stream movies through Netflix and Amazon I felt it wasn't worth spending more money on extra hard drive space that wasn't going to get used. Games that I usually play on my iPhone work awesome on the Mini mostly due to the larger display. While some might like the bigger screen on the iPad, this one is just a tad smaller (1.8 inches to be exact) which in all honesty is plenty big in my opinion. When holding the Mini, which you can do with one hand by the way, it definitely feels more like a tablet vs. holding a clipboard like it's larger sibling. I will definitely get a lot of use out of this product. I highly recommend to anyone looking for an awesome portable tablet.!###So after already owning two iPads in my household, an iPad 1, which I purchased when the iPad was first released and an iPad 2, which belongs to my wife, it was with reluctance that I was looking in a retail store at the new iPad mini.  After all, do I really need a third iPad?  There was a decent sale at the time and I decided to go for it and I have not regretted the purchase for one minute.Overall, the features, speed, front and rear camera, etc. are very comparable to its larger counterparts, however it is available in this smaller, more lightweight, compact and easier to carry mini form.  I find that taking this with me on a business or personal trip makes the bag much lighter and for equivalent features.  Taking photos with this product is much less awkward looking too than when i see people posing for the full size iPads (I still can't bring myself to do this).  I would say size wise, it is about 70% of the full size iPad but this has no great impact on the ability to read emails or type any differently than the larger iPad.  The full size iPads almost seem too large now that I am accustomed to the compact mini.I don't want to get into all the features of the iPad overall as I have not noticed any differences between this and my other iPads.  I have heard the RAM is less on the mini, but I have not noticed any difference as previously indicated.  It is well integrated with other Apple products, which I love about the iPads.  I can take a picture with my iphone and instantly it appears in my photostream for viewing on my iPad, iMac or AppleTv screensaver.Overall, great buy, even with two other iPads, I don't regret this purchase one bit.!###Works great and it's convenient.  Small and easy to carry during travel.  Very easy to use after I got some tips from my grandchildren.!###This was a gift for my wife on her birthday. She always wanted an iPad but didn't like the larger display because it didn't fit in her purse. This is basically a smaller iPad 2 with similar features, same processor (Dual Core A5), and cheaper price. If you are a fan of Apple iPads its a great buy.!###I've always purchased and used a PC both at home and at work.I've also prided myself in fixing the many PC problems I've encountered over the years, but certainly didn't appreciate the time and effort I had to spend on PC problems.I recently bought an ipad mini and love it. I wanted it as a quick access to the internet (wifi) and email.  Though I had never used an Apple before, I was really surprised how everything seemed rather intuitive and how quickly I was using it with ease for so many tasks. I have also found that the ipad mini is everything that it is advertised to be - the long battery life, many available apps, easy to use, etc.  I will soon be needing a new PC and am seriously considering a switch to Apple.  A friend of mine got tired to spending so much time just on keeping his PC updated and protected that he decided to switch to Apple 3 years ago and has never looked back.  I may follow in his footsteps as a result of my experience with Apple's ipad mini.!###I've had mine for almost a year of hard use on a daily basis for both work and play. My iPad mini has become an indispensable tool. This is a near perfect and high quality device, built like a tank, sexy design, power easily lasts me all day long in spite of intensive image processing use, excellent display even though it's not retina, extremely functional, I can easily hold and work with it in one hand. If you want a device that works consistently well all the time, then pay the higher price and get an iPad mini - you get what you pay for and it's definitely worth it. The mini has set and maintains the high standard by which other small tablets are measured by. Hold one in your hand, you'll see.!###I got an ipad mini, not from Amazon, but from a reward program, so was basically free. I received the 32GB version. I have to say it is an OK device, but overall, for screen resolution and overall sluggish performance, I still prefer my old Ipad2 and still, my Nexus 7 (first gen) remains king. I was hoping the ipad mini would satisfy my tablet needs, but it just made me want the new Nexus 7 32GB LTE even more...(if only Asus/Google could release it already!)Even I have to say that the edges on the face of the device are rough, not very smooth. I thought that it could be my device only, but stopped at two Apple stores in Greater Toronto area, to find that most Ipad minis on display had same issue.For those Apple fans ready to pounce: I own 4 Iphone 5, an Ipad Mini, an Ipad2, 2 ipod touch 4th gen, so I am giving an honest opinion here, I also own a couple of Android devices, but to me this Ipad mini seems under par...)!###I had an idea that the iPad Mini would be wonderful but it has exceeded my expectations! It is small, portable, but very powerful. Also, the service from the seller was great! I purchased a refurbished one and it was just as described.!###I absolutely love this tablet! I own many devices in my nerdism and line of work. I have owned an iPad 3, Nexus 7, Chromebook Series 5, all the iPhones, many Android phones by HTC and Samsung and now, my beloved iPad Mini.The thing about the mini is really the size and design. That outweighs everything else for me. It's gorgeous, a pleasure to use, and a pleasure to hold. The bigger iPads, no matter how powerful or brilliant, don't get as much use for me because they are hard to handle. I can never comfortably hold a big iPad for too long without noticing discomfort. Not the the larger iPads aren't wonderful devices, they just end up staying at home for me.The mini goes everywhere with me. It's fast enough to do everything I want it to do. The screen is still great even through non-retina, and I hardly notice the lower resolution at all. It's just a really awesome little device, and should be bought if you are thinking about it. Just buy it, you won't be disappointed.!###I was really excited about getting an I-pad mini for my birthday in August. Now, I wish my husband had purchased something else. It took about four hours for Apple to get it up and running. Four hours! I knew it wouldn't be as simple as turning on a button, but four hours is a bit much.There is a problem with this I-pad mini. I have had other difficulties with it.Another thing, no instructions came with this that even told me how to turn it on. I had to figure that out all by myself.My daughter purchased a cheaper brand, took her about one minute to set it up, and it works better than my expensive mini. Maybe for social media it's great. I don't do social media, so I really wouldn't know about that.I ordered three albums from I-tunes on it: one I was charged a dollar for. Then that was taken off my bank balance, and I still haven't been billed the correct amount. Another was supposed to have been $6.98 plus tax. It came to $17.something. There seems to be no rhyme nor reason to their pricing.Grrr!Another problem is the battery. This definitely does not hold a charge, even though I turn the device off when I'm not using it. This is just annoying, and I've decided not to use it for an e-reader. I have my Kindle,and the battery holds a charge much better. I am thinking about purchasing a kindle fire. I really can't see the I-pad mini as any kind of substitute for an e-reader or lap top.Update 1/11/2014: My I-pad mini has died. It isn't recharging at all. I deeply regret having purchased this. Other problems, when I type a comma, it switches it to an s or a totally different word! Disgusting. I don't know for sure, but I bet this was a used one sold as new. Too may problems to name here, but I will say if this is representative of an apple product, I'm not purchasing anymore apples. My Ipad mini has Itunes I've purchased. That was wasted money because now I can't use the Ipad to play them. Don't buy the mini. It's just a piece of junk!Update 2/17/2014: Took my iPad mini in. The UBS adapter was the wrong size for my mini. Also the UBS cable wires were bent. I bought a replacement for both items. Yesterday, I opened up Siri. I hadn't tried to use that before. I discovered all kinds of names in it. For instance, e-mail Shirley. Make reservations at a restaurant in Paris. It is loaded with other names and instructions. I know none of the names, and I've never even asked Siri for anything. I paid full price for a used item. grrr.!###WARNING!  Do not buy an iPad until you KNOW! how to operate one.  I've seldom had a problem learning how a gizmo functions so I foolishly bought my iPad believing there would be no problem mastering it.  WRONG!WRONG! WRONG! There is a hugh problem learning how to use it starting with the fact that there were no operating instructions included in the box.  And Apple dose not include sufficient operating instructions on the machine itself.  So you can swipe all you want to but you will merely return to the page you started from.  So learn to use the iPad BEFORE! you purchase one.!###I EXPECT THE IPAD MINI IS ALL THEY SAY IT IS.  HOWEVER, IT COMES WITH NOT ONE BIT OF WRITTEN INSTRUCTION AS TO IT'S USE, AND THIS LEAVES THE SENIOR/INEXPERIENCED USERS LARGELY HELPLESS.  EVIDENCE OF THIS OPINION CAN BE FOUND BY GOOGLING  &#34;INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE IPAD&#34; AND SEEING HOW MANY COMPUTER GEEKS ARE CASHING IN ON APPLE'S INSISTENCE THAT NO INSTRUCTIONS ARE NEEDED.  AFTER REVIEWING A FEW OF THESE 'TEACHING' GUIDES, I DECIDED ON ONE, ONLY TO FIND THAT IT COST ABOUT A THIRD AS MUCH AS THE IPAD!I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO BEGINNERS IN TOUCH SCREEN TECHNOLOGY OR TO ANYONE OVER THE AGE OF 45.!###The item had a defect in the upper right corner; it felt from my bed (12 in) while it was INSIDE the case and the screen broke beginning from where the defect was.!###The ipad mini is a great piece of hardware. It is a perfect device.... nearly. There are some things that i want to tell you.The ipad mini is not better than the ipad 2 or only a little bit. The price compared to the size and all other aspects is too high.I had it in my handy and have testet it. The ipad is a couch device. So why do i need a small version, if i can have a big version for nearly the same price?So or so it does not fit good into a small bag. Compare it before you buy it. I have chosen this one for myself at the end http://amzn.to/1bYiqYE!###PROSLooks niceOK app Market.Bright Screen.readsCONSHidden app costsEXPENSIVE!!Low value/ performance ratio.Bad batteryHeavySlow with many appsApple stores lie to you and take advantage if you aren't tech savvy (luckily I am)Get a kindle fire HDX Wayyyy better support!!###The iPad mini is a good product, I guess, but here is my problem.  I have two original ipads (a Gen I and recent Gen III).  The big ipads are very robust; kids play with them, drop them out windows, use them to build forts, teach the dogs to fetch, etc., and I throw them in my pickup, use them on the jobsite, whatever.  Ive had the Gen I since 2010, and the other one for more than a year, and, although they both have extensive damage to the metal cases, and although the screen seal of the Gen I is half gone, neither screen has ever cracked.Both of my ipad minis have cracked screens.  One broke while bouncing up and down on the floor of my truck while driving on a dirt  road. The other screen broke when two of my kids were in a tug o war over the ipad. They didn't drop it, one just twisted it out of the others' hand and it cracked.  The ironic thing was when I went to the istore, and some "Genius" explained to me that I am totally wrong, and the iPad mini is much more robust than the ipad original.  Obviously I know the "Genius" thing is supposed to be ironic, but this was still a little irritating.Here is the deal. The ipad mini with a broken screen costs $219 to fix.  That is right. $220 to fix a product that costs a hair over $300 bucks.  I sold the first one on ebay for $170 (I mean, seriously, who would pay $170 for a broken ipad mini? What is going on there? Who knows?)  I am about to list the second.Bottom line: If you are a very careful old lady who uses the ipad mini once or twice a month on foam rubber on the floor and caresses the screen gently with a hypoallergenic goose feather before your servant locks it back away in a padded vault, this is the perfect device for you. On the other hand, if you are like a regular person who might actually use the device in the real world, the ipad mini is a little too dainty, especially if you have kids. I would definitely recommend the big ipad instead.Go on the apple support forums and you will see that my problem is very common with the mini.  Good luck!!###We only gave one star because zero stars was not an option.  We just bought my daughter a mini for Christmas and she loved it.  It was sitting on her desk and the glass screen broke, spent over an hour with service reps that gave us the too bad, so sad, she must have dropped it (she didn't).  It will cost well over two hundred dollars to repair, I'm sure about three hundred when it is all said and done.  Even the reps i spoke with said their screens broke too...what a bummer.  If this is a problem this big Apple had better fix it fast.  We will never buy another Apple anything.  Their one year warranty is a complete joke it covers absolutely nothing.  All of my daughters school work is on this four hundred dollar apple paper weight.  Don't fall for any of their jargon, it means nothing, just like their customer satisfaction.  Buyer should beware, read all of the fine print, have your lawyer look it over because they WILL weasel out of it. We got three whole months before this happened.  The extra warranty doesn't cover anything either, only cost a hundred and fifty more.  I guess we see why apple is being overtaken by Samsung, because that is what we are getting next.  Uuurrrrgghh just spent the last hour with apple reps who do nothing.  Sorry for the rant just wanted to warn anybody thinking of buying junk.  You are better off throwing four hundred dollars in the wind.  Any questions email me at waynorsgirl1@yahoo.com before buying.  Thank you for your time/!###Well, I am not here to tell you how good/pretty/friendly Apple products are, but I am here to tell you how cheaply this ipad mini is made.  It is so thin that it is very fragile.  I had the ipad mini covered with a case and my little girl dropped it from her hand, which is about 2'5" feet high, onto a wooden floor and it is cracked right away.  The replacement screen service from Apple will cost about $220 which is almost the price of a new one.  The replacement screen sells on Amazon or elsewhere is about $60-150, the $60 one requires professional soldering, but the similar digitized screen for a regular ipad2 is cost only about $30 bucks.  Do you see where I am going?  They made a fragile product, jacked up the price of the service and cost for the replacement screen.!###I was the happy owner of a Kindle Fire until my husband decided to "upgrade me" to an Ipad Mini as an anniversary gift.  Yes, it's shiny and lighter but extremely fragile. An accidental drop of no more than three-feet. . . the result: a hairline crack (top left to bottom right and a semi-circle hairline crack on both ends).  While I repeatedly read online that if you catch an Apple employee "on a good day" they may do it for free, the helpful Apple employee I spoke to was quick to quote $219 to replace it because I don't have Apple Care (since this was a gift I had never heard of Apple Care).  A new Ipad Mini costs $329 and a screen replacement starts at $219? How does that make sense?  Should've bought the Kindle Fire HD!!###The iPad mini is a great tablet and the size is perfect for those of us with small hands (and small handbags) .  I think one of the things I'm  most impressed with is the picture quality.  I'd recommend the iPad mini for anyone considering buying a tablet.!###I never thought I would buy 7 or 8 inch tablet. I'm the owner of iPad 4 and now I recently purchased iPad mini. When I compare two of these devices, iPad 4 definatey little faster but not by large margin. I thought by putting iPad 2 processor chip iPad mini would be lagging but I was wrong.. Apple did update the Internet wifi chip and it has the same network card found in iPad 4. iPad mini is fast when it comes to browsing and watching youtube videos etc. I don't see any big of a difference when I play iPad 4 and mini side by side.. Mini is so light and handy,now I barely use iPad 4. I'm very satisfied with iPad mini.!###Love the ipad mini.  It fits in my purse, it's big enough to do all tasks I do on my computer at home.  Works perfectly like all my apple products.  Much easier to take along than a laptop!!###Let me start by saying my household is Apple products ONLY. There's no need for me to try anything else because I've have other products in the past and they have been ok at times but for the most part just a PITA. Every since the first iPhone came out, I've been impressed and at times in the past, I've tried other phones and none of them held a torch to the iPhone. From computer to Apple TV to iPads, we have them in our house. The ipad mini was our latest addition and upon getting one for my wife I chose to get another for myself. I was using the IPad 2 but I just had to get a "mini" for myself.It's been an awesome lil machine. I like that I can easily put it in my side cargo pants pocket and go. That's a plus. It operates just as any other ipad does to me just has Siri and a lil better picture quality. Yet and still I wouldn't trade any of them.If you want quality, get an IPad, if you just want to freeze up surfing the web or freeze up doing anything, get a Android tablet. I love Apple and their products.!###My husband got me this for Christmas,  It has been great to  keep alot of stuff on that I use to have to do on the computer, Now I just take it with me.!###This is the first Apple product for me and I love it. With this 8&#34; size Apple made excellent yob! It is perfect for traveling, good fit in hand and still big enough for watching movies on it. For shore, this is certainly not my last piece of Apple technology at home.!###i can now see the screen..takes excellent pictures..someone told me there is a phone app for it but i cant find it!###I had the iPad 32gb wifi original. I sold it through amazon sales. I wanted something lighter weight and smaller. I'm a writer, publisher, and a student. I needed something that wasn't going to take up a lot of space in my bag. My macbook adds just enough extra weight that makes my bag hurt my shoulder. So, I had it and invested in the iPad mini.I purchased the refurbished one from Apple. It was sent from China and I got it in a surprisingly short time. I am amazed at how light weight this piece is. I purchased the white because for me I just thought it was very nice looking. I don't put a lot of stuff on the iPad itself so the wifi 16gb is more than enough for me. If I watch music I use Amazon Instant Video or Netflix. I also use this to read a lot of my kindle books. I sold my Kindle fire original on Amazon as well, since I am spring cleaning and trying to get rid of all my excess crap.For this iPad it is small but it is beneficially small. It is perfect for me. I have small hands so the on screen keyboard size isn't a bother. However, I did purchase the white Logitech keyboard case to match.I wasn't concerned about retina display. I think at this size the condensed screen showing HD videos is more than enough. Honestly, if you're that concerned over quality of photos and videos past standard HD then you should be on a full size iPad or a computer itself.!###The apple iPad mini is great. After having an ipad for a year, I love the size of the iPad mini. Small enough to throw in my purse, but big enough to be able to read the print.!###I'm much more impressed than I thought I would be with the new iPad mini.  For comparison purposes I currently use my Nexus 7 tablet, Acer Iconia A500 tablet, Kindle tough and HTC One X. I'm not going to nitpick hardware specs.  Sure the screen isn't IPS but I don't see the big difference unless I have two devices side-by-side.  In actual use,  they all have fantastic screens.=========================10=Good,  1=Bad=========================Browsing  7Gaming  8Reading  8Productivity/Work 6Battery Life  9Adapters 5Connectivity 5 (proprietaryVideo Playback 8Wifi Performance  4CPU/UI Speed  9=========================Overall = 6.9=============================== IPAD TIPS ==========================================================  * Close an app: our or five finger pinching motion  * Navigate open apps: four or five fingered horizontal swipe  * Take a screen shot: Hold the power button and home button.

This is a much better ebook reader than I thought it would be.  In low light situations it is much nicer than a Kindle. The devise is easier to hold with two hands than one. The iPad mini is also great for gaming and watching videos.  I have a larger tablet (10.1) also and this size is just more fun and portable. I accessed my work desktop using Citrix Receiver and it worked great for reading email and other documents and impromptu typing. Sound quality was excellent as usual. The new power connector is easier to plug in. The battery life far exceeds than any other device I own except the Kindle Touch.The things that I thought could use some improvement were few but an annoying few.  WiFi performance is really lacking.  At home, at work and on travel the Wifi is really slow.  App downloads are horribly slow on connections I know to be fast.  I tried connecting at 5G also and it didn't make any improvement. Every once in a while I think the screen jitters.  It would be an artifact from the scree auto-rotating.  I was a little disappointed that it didn't come with some nice Apple earbuds. For the price I would have expected it. The power adapter is yet another Apple-proprietary connector.  So more money on chargers and more chargers laying around.Overall this is a great tablet with awesome performance and has an extremely convenient size.!###I have a IPad in the normal size but this one is very confortable to carry anywhere, principally in trips.!###It look like a new&#65292; but it still has some flaw&#65292; but it doesn't matter&#65292; it still looks good&#65292; I like it!###The ipad arrived scratched on the back and even a little bit also the screenThe ipad arrived scratched on the back and even a little bit also the screen!###The iPad mini is new and no opened.

The obvious is not obvious to me, and I have to do much searching and googleing......becoming a pain.....I am disappointed in the operating system......but I will keep trying......Amazon seems to hold your hand while learning.....the apple ipad is not that easy to use. I spent hours trying to get on the ipad internet, only to find out I was aready on the internet!  I felt so dumb!!!!  I love my Kindle.....so I do not know what the heck I am doing with this device?????  I cannot tell you how long it took me to import my kindle books to this ipad device........too long!  However, I began to find my Fire too heavy for all day use with my arthritic fingers. I will keep plugging away with this ipad device......however, I find it very labor intensive, and not enjoyable yet.......thank you for asking for my humble opinion......Gayle!###I love my iPad Mini.

I actually traded my mini to someone for an iPad 3 which suits my purposes better.  If you need the portability and don't mind the smaller screen, it's convenience and performance are great.  I'd just recommend seeing it in person and using both size tablets (and Retina vs. regular display) to see which suits you best.!###I received my iPad Mini, just as described and I love it!  It might be a little heavier than I expected, but not a problem.  The one thing I don't like about it is the active screen is so close to the edges that sometimes when I'm holding it in my hand, my fingertips interfere with the functioning.  I purchased an inexpensive Khomo case for it and that made all the difference in the world.!###This is an amazing tablet/computer. It's so light and the thinnest tablet I've ever seen. 7.9 inches may seem small on your computer screen, but it's actually a decent size. And light and small enough to hold in only one hand. It's perfect for typing papers with Pages. But I do recommend buying a BlueTooth keyboard, which is what I am using now to type this review. Watching movies is awesome. And games from the App Store are so fun to play. The only down side is that it's not as clear as the full size iPad. But that really isn't a big deal unless you're super crazy about that kind of stuff. Otherwise I highly recommend this tablet to anyone looking for something like this. I hope you decide to buy one, it'll be worth the money.!###I already have numerous Apple products, and I even have a Ipad. The mini offers everything the bigger one has with a little more portability. Fast shipping an good price. Would recommend.!###arrived on time, works perfectly  I recommend buying it, is a good choice for a good price, FIVE STARS FOR THIS PRODUCT!###It does all the things the original iPad did and it's easy to carry. I just streamed a movie to AppleTV. Awesome for reading. I dictated this review with my iPad mini. It is worth the slight premium. The bottom line is will you use it and I already have been a lot.!###Ordered this as a gift for my kids on Christmas.  Instant hit, very easy to use, and because of the size it is a lot easier to handle for kids with small hands.!###Perfect because it has all functions of the full-size iPad and it is lighter. But it could also include smartphone functions, considering that the SIM card is already in place. If so, I would only need to carry one gadget instead of two today. Think about it....!###I am NOT an Apple Junkie. Yes I own 2 Apple products: the new Nano and the iPad mini. Ive had ipads before but they were too big and heavy. With the mini I get the perfect size tablet. Screen res is not as my Samsung galaxy 2 7.0. But there is more content available for the ipad. I like the mini's ease of use and makes a good 2nd tablet. Now I have a good Android and Apple tablet. If Apple would a better display it would be the.best tablet.!###Outstanding product from my favorite computer company. Works great, very fast, super app's and so many more to find! Love working with it.!###As everyone i love the Apple products, i have an iphone, ipod, mac and to complete the collection the ipad mini, the devices is awesome, the weight is really light, size adequate. Perfect to carry wherever you go and work but you should buy in the store, my box brought a damaged cable, not such a big deal but i had to go to the store and ask for an exchange, the did it without showing the receipt, after that everything was fine.!###Ok so I have a nexus 7 and as much as I love it and love the android operating system I can't lie and say the performance is always wonderful. It doesn't matter what the specs are it stutters with web browsing, a lot of games lag. It's really nice for the price but meh. Anyways I decided to overpay for the iPad mini because i'm an idiot and also because I saw better performance from youtube videos. Plus I wanted some of the exclusive apps. The tablet performs amazingly. Every app, game, and just everything runs great! The screen could be sharper for what I paid but I will take performance over a pretty screen any day. I kinda find ios a bit boring as well because I prefer the complication of android. I would love the emulators but i can't get them on the mini. There's no jailbreak for the mini so no emulators. The camera is ok but I have an actual camera that kills the ipads camera so that's nothing worth paying for. I love the screen size, and the weight. I love how thin the device is as well. All in all it's a great tablet but it does carry a price tag based on the massive ego of apple and not so much the product. 1 star is removed for the price. It's hard to remove more then that because I really like the product.!###Everything about this has been a breeze; my order was filled promptly; syncing to my old iPod's information took but a minute and getting the hang of all its bells and whistles is a cinch. This product is sturdy, well-built and even bigger than I thought it would be; processing is fast and picture is clear. In short, I love it and would recommend to anyone.!###I'm not an "iSheep", I'm not a total tech person and I don't prefer everything to be Apple, but they really do make premium products, and to be honest, I really like this tablet. It's the perfect size.. it isn't too small or too big. It's so much lighter and so much better looking that my previous ipad 3 which I ended up getting rid of just to get this. I bought this at Best Buy a few days ago and I love it! It runs so smoothly, and I can hold it up for a long time before it strains my wrist. It's so portable, I could carry it anywhere. The charger is less clunky.  The tablet is so smooth.. feels really nice. I like the smaller bezels, it gives so much more space. Why I love the Mini is because it's not too small, but it's not big either. It's almost the perfect reading device. I can also type easily.My biggest obvious complaint is that it has no Retina display. Yes, I know the second one will have Retina, but I really didn't want to wait to replace the heavier iPad 3. And truthfully, the screen's resolution isn't horrible, but it's a much better improvement from the ipad 2. However, looking at the Mini, you will notice text will be blurrier and you will see individual pixels if you are used to Retina. Had it had Retina and better specifications, I would've given it five stars. I can't complain, I chose to buy it. Plus, Apple seems to still be selling their iPad 2 for $399. Overall, I am happy with my purchase. This device has potential and it's very fun.!###Three words: wonderful, wonderful. wonderful. I already own an Ipad 2 and wanted a smaller screen for traveling, bedside etc. So, I thought I'd enter the Android world and purchased a Samsung Galaxy tab 2. The 8gb available is not nearly sufficient and the micro SD slot will not allow you to transfer apps or rented/ purchased tv and movies because of copyright issues. So, what is the point of expandable memory?? Returned it and bought the Google Nexus 7. This is a nice tablet but I was frequently charging the battery and the 7" size looked small to me. Thank goodness I purchased it at a retailer where I had 15 days to return. I visited an Apple store and happened to look at the Ipad minis. I could not wait to return the nexus and I bought the mini. Sure, more money, but you get what you pay for. These tablets are so smooth, and display none of "hesitation" while scrolling that the Android tablets do. The color and contrast are far superior to the android tablets and the 7.9 inch screen looks huge next to the 7" Android screens. BUY IT! You'll love the Ipad mini.!###I bought this as a gift for my wife and she absolutely loved it! She tried to use the regular iPad but its 10' screen was too big for her purse. The look and feel of it made it to a perfect companion, being small, beautiful and very useful. It was also a success with our kids that would rather play the games on a smaller device that is friendlier than the big 3rd generation iPad they used to borrow from me.!###I was on the fence with purchasing the iPad mini and am so glad I did. When the original iPad came out I purchased it, but later sold it because with having both an iPhone & a MacBook, I couldn't justify having another portable device - but the mini changes this. I absolutely love this smaller design, it is so much lighter & fits in one hand so it is so much easier & enjoyable to use and the way the edges are curved it just fits perfect in the hand. All of the full sized iPads (especially the latest Retina generation) are beautiful & wonderful, but if you're looking for something that's more comfortable in the hand where you don't have to constantly hold it with two hands or rest it against your legs because of the size & weight, the mini is your best bet. I now find that I use my iPad mini ALL THE TIME because it feels so right in my hands. Plus, since it's smaller it's much easier for me to slip in my purse & carry on the go.As with all iPad's I've used, it functions & performs just as beautifully. Of course, the mini doesn't have the power that the full sized iPads have, so if you're wanting to do graphic intensive games or videos, go with the full sized iPad. I have played lots of basic games & constantly stream videos all without a problem, but it may be an issue if you want to do graphic intensive games. I stream video from my iPad to my Apple TV daily (cuts cable!) and I've never had a problem with any lags or graphic problems (unless my wifi goes out...my wifi company is iffy & has been for years, but that's a whole different story).The only thing that would make this iPad mini perfect is if it had a Retina display. I know it is only a matter of time & we will (hopefully) see a retina display on the second generation iPad mini, but I really wish they could have done a retina display the first time around. Switching from my iPhone 5 to the mini I can definitely see a loss in the sharpness of text which is unfortunate since I love using my iPad mini for reading books. It's not a huge deal since everything still looks great & is more than useable (in fact, if you don't have any other Apple products with retina you probably won't know what I'm talking about), but if you're going from a retina display iPhone or iPad you really will notice the loss of quality.Overall, it's a great product & I highly recommend it! Of course there are other brand tablets with lower price points, but I love the quality & service of Apple products & that's what keeps me coming back.!###Love the mini.  Does everything it's bigger siblings can do, and a lot more conveniently.  Almost wish you could make calls with it!!###I bought Mini ipad, Dell window 8 pro, & Samsung tab 8". I compare them side by side. The screen & resolution of Mini ipad is the worst as compared to others. After seeing the text on Dell & Samsung tab 8" (1280x800 resolution), I don't want to read any thing on Mini Ipad ANY MORE. 1280x800 should be the minimal resolution for reading. The text looks nicer, sharper, much easier to read, and importantly, puts much less strain on your eyes. Text on Ipad Mini appears blurry as compared to Dell & Samsung, therefore, is hard to read on such small device.Web searching & emailing & reading experience is best on Dell window tablet b/c it is a regular computer. Android & Ipad can not compare to it. There are many webpages that I can not zoom in & out, & text is too small to read w/o zooming on Ipad Mini. Also, Dell is faster opening the webpages.. Longer screen of Dell & Samsung is better for reading b/c it could include more text in landscape view. But, Ipad Mini is better (to me) to watch video b/c its wider 4:3 screen size produces larger screen view for movie viewing.Pictures & games look good on ALL these three devices.All these 3 devices are beautiful in their own ways and all are light & are comfy to hold. BUT, Mini Ipad is very slippery b/c of its very smooth back side. However, one needs to buy a jacket for it any way. Ipad Mini is wider, so, is harder to hold in one hand (in portray view) AS COMPARED to slimmer Dell & Samsung tablets.No SD card to expand is a HUGE disadvantage for Mini Ipad.No USB port is another HUGE disadvantage for Mini Ipad (one got to pay extra $$$ for a USB adapter).Many basic, common functions for daily use are lacking or are very difficult to use in Ipad Mini, & so, are HUGE disadvantages, i.e: files transfer, video transfer, or documents (words/PDF) transferring & reading/editing .... Even if you pay for doc/Word editing apps, those edited files will not appear like what you make them when you open them on your regular computer/laptop. You don't want to go through few hundreds edited pages to proof read again. How can it be used for school works as people have claimed ?? I'm wondering !!!. I recently found few free apps that allow users to easily perform some of the above functions (transferring & viewing mostly) - this is one of big reasons why I bought Mini Ipad for my kids JUST NOW. Ipad forums show that ALL Ipad users have been suffering this limit for decades ...... . BUT, despite of these facts, & even though after many years, many Ipad fans still SHAMELESSLY deny its limitation, or lie about it, or still blindly defend it - many of them are probably on Apple pay roll, trying to push the sale by lying.One thing that Ipad Mini wins over others is its apps & games. But, Android device is not far behind, and reality is you don't see much difference between them when you look for apps for your daily needs, your daily uses.Also, The cost for Mini Ipad is high for its value at this current time, and is higher than other devices which have many better features. Ipad Mini should be around $200 or less.My kids' relatives have Ipads, and kids like to play games together. Therefore, I have to buy Ipad for them instead of other devices. I buy Dell device for myself. Ipad Mini probably is OK for whoever just needs entertainment or social media, and is willing to accept its limitation.!###i dot now what happen, but the product it does not work... i think it recibed a crash duiring the transportation... i dot know wthat can i do?!###Watch out for purchasing your NEW iPad mini.  We knew nothing about Apple products.The unit was shipped last month, via FedesxSmartPost (which was a headache, very poor shipping)with the old iOS6 operating system which the people at the Apple Store fixed right away with a 20minute download. So, if you are wanting to buy from Amazon, know that they are fulfilling orders withvery old stock of I pad mini's!!###Crashes on any app including built in apps like maps after 20 seconds or so.  Went back and forth with apple.  The store wants to replace our brand new mini with a refurbished unit.  Will never support apple or the products again.  I am completely dissatisfied with the product and lack of support.!###Not a good device at all.  Memory is woefully inadequate in the base model, and Apple charges $100 for a lousy 16gb of additional memory in upgraded models.  How unethical can you get?  A 128 Gig memory card cost $120, so why does Apple charge $100 for 16?  With no slot for a memory card there is no way for me to store my videos and photos except to offload and onload through itunes.  When I am out in the field I have to carry my windows netbook around with me to make the ipad functional!  Utterly ridiculous!  Why, there isn't even a usb port to connect to a portable drive I could keep in my pocket!  Who came up with this asinine scheme?  And why should I have to offload and onload anything to make it work?  While the colors are bright and the graphics are nice and the buttons are easy to use, the dysfunctional operating characteristics of this tablet make it a very poor value.!###Item looks beautiful but, arrived defective it would not pick up Wifi and is typing the wrong letters. It is a piece of garbage. I truly regret purchasing this item and now I know it would have been better spending $16.00 more at Best Buy for a fully functional Ipad. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this garbage because Amazon won't back or, support you. You might as well give you $284.00 to a beggar.Eve!###I've purchased several Apple products. They eventually drop. Mine dropped while I was seating, I even tried catching it on the air but a 45 cm fall was enough to assassin this glass-only device. The edges are so slim that they will bend and quickly press the glass to rupture. If you buy this, it has to be bundled with a bumper or any sort of similar protection, else, you may know its fate.!###I have had a REFURBISHED iPad for 2yrs that is 100% better than this expensive piece of junk. I purchased this because of its size and easy portability. Should have just stuck with my original and saved $400. It shuts itself down, freezes and just today sounded like it sparked and I had a totally blue screen for 10 minutes before either I finally got it to shut down or it crashed itself. Unfortunately for me, I was overly optimistic when I purchased it and threw the damn box away so I'm stuck.!###This ipad is without retina display. Apple and other stores are selling it for $300 recently got one. This is expensive and they are calling this a deal....!###No wi fi. Spent 2hours with Apple rep. on phone.Should have been tested.Seems to work .fine now but still keeping box for return.!###Bought for wife she lives it very much. I myself could care less about apple products being avid PC gamer/builder!###I love the form factor but I have to say that I'm very disappointed with the durability of the device. Both my screen and back are scratched after dropping my device by accident. I should be happy I didn't get a spider web on my screen but they say the glass is gorilla glass so why is the glass easily scratched? i've dropped my nexus 7 more times than I could count and I have had no scratches on the front and back.I expected durability knowing it's an apple product.!###Esta perfecto, el tama&ntilde;o, la camara, lo puedo transportar facil, me gusto mucho, las aplicaciones pues ya saben geniales, comprenlo!###Do not order anything from BMG Logic.  I ordered a NEW Ipad Mini and got a USED one with finger prints and a scratch on the screen.  The back of the IPAD was dirty from finger prints and the package was not sealed in a new box.  Not even the USB cord was wrapped right.If I wanted used I would have ordered used.  I ordered new and paid the price of new.Very disapponted customer.  I am trying to return this item and will get one somewhere else.!###I told myself I'd never buy an apple, but my school had a sale on this model and I was in some need of a tablet for school, so I grabbed one of these.  Cut to two weeks later, I'm eating with a group of friends and pass an empty cup over the iPad, in its case, and it falls the three inches down to the device. An empty, plastic cup. Three inches. And the glass around the button shatters like satan himself hit it with a hammer. I will never purchase an apple product again.  The cost of screen replacement is literally half of what I spent buying this damn thing.Idevices shatter more easily than a child's dream of being a princess.Definitely sticking with android permanently now.!###The ipad mini isn't really a bad tablet. It does what it's supposed to. No flash but whatever. My qualm is how freaking fragile this thing is. I dropped mine literally a foot of the ground. Cracked on the right corner. Hey apple do ya ever test out your products. Do you think now one is going to drop your swarovski glass? Get a kindle fire for a cheaper price. Pretty much get any tablet other than this. I shouldn't have a $300 portable piece of equipment crack from a one foot fall. This isn't a laptop where you put it on the table. You keep this in your hands. No gracias APPLE!!###This product don't stand the test when compared to the Surface. I have a couple of each product and I much more prefer the Surface. The IPAD just don't meet my expectations.!###why dont these things come with an instruction book? I have played with this and really dont see the big deal.!###There is a lot of things not working on my ipad mini and when I call apple for help, apple wanted more money before they would give me any advice on how to work my iPad mini. My iMessage & ICloud wouldn't work and still isn't working, I'm refusing to pay more money for something I've already paid more than enough already. On top of that it seems an ipad is very limited to what an ipad can actually be used for. You will still need a regular laptop or home computer for most things, for iPad doesn't allow, which is A Lot!. iPad mini is basically a big mobile unit. It's not looked at as a laptop. It would be better to buy a lap top than a iPad!!!!! iPad is a empty money pit that doesn't end, it's like buying a used car.!###I love my iPad Mini, However it does not charge properly part of the time. The cord seemed defective, so we took it to the Apple store to get a replacement. We were shocked to find out from the Apple employee that the charging cord that came in the box with my brand new{?} Apple iPad Mini bought from this seller is NOT an Apple product! So buyer beware! How does that happen ? Makes me question if the Mini was really new. It is past time for returning it, so I have no recourse but to write this honest review to tell others to beware of buying from this seller and if you do, check the cord included right away to see if it is in fact an authentic Apple product. I have never written a review, much less a negative one, but felt others should know about this discrepancy. My husband bought it from one of the higher rated sellers so this sort of thing wouldn't happen. Oh well!!###Piece design was not what I expected.  This is a magnetic cover only.  Provides no protection to base and limited protection to face.My plan was to return it until I found a clear hard plexiglass cover, made by Rocktfish, that the tablet securely snaps into. Then the magnetic iPad cover slips perfectly into place as if they were designed for this purpose.I still wish there was a full cover designed by Apple for the iPad mini.  This is swell for now.  Fits nicely, very slim profile, in my handbag without conflict.!###I am very disappointed with the Sprint network.  Though I live right in the middle of San Antonio, I cannot connect with Sprint's vaunted LTE network from my home.  Worse, Sprint's antiquated CDMA network architecture isn't used in the rest of the world so connecting for updates overseas is impossible.  I should have gone with AT&T as the carrier.  My GSM networked iPhone works in the UK, the middle east, and in Africa no problem, while my iPad is totally disconnected.  You will only realize how big a problem this is when you discover how many apps won't work unless they are connected to a cellular network.  Sprint is a big mistake. Should have done more homework because their cheaper data plans don't make up for their network architecture shortcomings.  True enough, the iPad works fine when connected with WiFi, but outside the U.S. WiFi networks remind me of 300 baud modems -- &#34;you are now connected to the world wide wait&#34;.Another problem with the iPad is the inability to import photos using an Apple supplied SD card reader that plugs into the mini's Lightning port.  Turns out, Apple has got the iPad software so locked down that the card reader won't function with an SD card from anything other than the simplest point and shoot camera.  If you use a good Nikon, Canon or other high end Digital SLR camera that stores jpg files in separate folders you can forget about importing your photos directly into an iPad.  Great job, Apple!!###The video display, especially for small texts is fuzzy. You assume that the newest apple device will have sharp texts even if it doesn't have retina display. After using my iPhone 5 and iPad 4 for a few month now, my eyes can not with the fuzziness of the text. It has the equivalence of an $150 tablet in regards to the the sharpness of texts. I bought it and returned it in the se day. So check out a website or book with small tests before buying. Some say its not that bad, but for 350$ I expected more.!###Being an android user for the past four years I was skeptical at just how much I would like an apple tablet, but I have seen the light. I finally bit the bullet and now have my first apple tablet and could kick myself for not doing it sooner. I wear three professional hats as an actor, producer, and business owner and the iPad has apps not found on the Android market that have immensely increased my productivity in all three. Also, the iPad makes entertainment SO much easier managing everything through iTunes. If you aren't sure whether to go with an Android tablet or Apple trust me I've now had both and can tell you won't regret going with the iPad. That is just my opinion.!###This add lies.Says:  Processor 2.4 GHz Apple A5That's wrong.It should read.  1.0GHZ.getting tired of these amazon pages always lying about specs.i just bought another tablet that said 4GB capacity,  it only came with one.get on the ball amazon before lawsuits start popping up.!###This is a great product. It's small and travel friendly and easy to carry everywhere with you.  When your computer is not at hand, you can start papers and the Just move them thru Dropbox. I love this tablet.!###I like apple products but I'm not too crazy about it either. I don't make a big deal like some people who just can't stay quite and choose to be a apple fanatic. iPad mini is good but in my humble opinion I don't think it's as good as nexus 7 or samsung tablets just because their tablets has a much more interactive fluid operation system with better features and more perks. For example, the galaxy tab note has a ton of better features than mini. The mini is very simple very basic. It's almost like a big version of iPhone or phablet. I have had the experience of using mini and when I compared it to my old nexus 7 and galaxy note for me I could see the big difference in the operation system, features, and the overall quality of all the three devices and basically decided that I prefer android tablets (namely Samsung or nexus) rather than apple ipad generation of tablets. Maybe in the future when there's better features integrated and operating system improves for apple products or IOS than I will consider apple products but for now I enjoy android operation system and their way cooler than apple so I'll stay with android for the the time being. Hope this helps a little! Oh and to make it a little more clearer i think iPad min is okay, not the best!!###I bought this NEW IPad Mini and had it shipped in two days and it arrived on time.  After reading a previous review about receiving a used IPad Mini instead of a NEW one, I made sure to check it out completely by taking it out of the packing before giving it as a present.  I definitely think I got a refurbished IPad Mini and here are my thoughts on why:I watched a YouTube video on unboxing a new IPad Mini to see how an IPad Mini came packaged.  At first I noticed the box had a few dents but thought this was due to shipping.  Also the serial number on the back and all the bar codes seemed to be rubbed off and not easily visible to read (I still have my Ipad box after 2 years and the bar codes never smudged).  Next I noticed a lot of particles on the surface of the screen which is odd and the back of the IPad looked a little worn (not so silvery in a few spots).  When watching the YouTube video, I saw that there should be three papers included in the box, a card with all the buttons, an apple sticker, and some other information.  My box had no apple sticker and only one card.I turned the IPad one and it worked and was fully charged (Ipad&#8217;s and Iphone&#8217;s usually never come fully charged).  When I eventually gave it as the gift I set it up for my mom and it was not linked to anyone&#8217;s account and turned on like new.To double check I searched the serial number on Apple&#8217;s website and the Ipad Mini only had about 3 days left of phone support when it should have either 60 or 90 days (I forget the exact amount).I decided to keep the Ipad Mini and give it as a gift anyway as I don&#8217;t think it would have been worth contacting the vendor and filing a claim however I am disappointed that it most likely was not a new Ipad Mini.  Also Apple does not sell these models in stores anymore as the Ipad Mini Retina is now available.My review is mostly to inform you to buy this product directly from Best Buy or any other electronic store if you can or order a used IPad instead of a new one.!###My mom loves this gift we sent her. It arrrived  on time just like the company promised. She is 71 and is able to do almost everything you you do on a pc. She loves to read so this is a welcome  aspect. She can take it in her purse on vacation and anywhere else.!###great product, regular battery duration, white color nicer, I would recommend it to buy it, I received my prouct very fast!###Comes in handy n it's really helpfull and fun for the kids and road trips in the car where ever u go.!###First, I want to say that I only rated this at 2 stars due to the following... operation wise it worked well; we love the size and convenience, etc.This was/is our first IPad. And every other owner of an Iphone, IPod, Iwhatever... is aware that the glass/screen/digitizer can shatter pretty easily. I changed the digitizer on my 2nd Gen Ipod before and it was a breeze, so that's not a big deal or a big cost ($9 for the IPod touch) digitizer).Shortly after getting our IPad Mini the screen somehow cracked/shattered!!!! We have no idea how it happened and were of course irate. Knowing that the 'basic' warranty wouldn't cover such a repair, I look at how much the screen/digitizer costs (60-179 btw). I found one for around 60. The removal went ok...minus some added difficulty due to the shattered glass. BUT HERE's THE PROBLEM.The Home Button does not come with the digitizer and MUST be transferred to the new one if/when it has to be replaced!  The issue here is that this REQUIRES SOLDERING!!!! Search for it if you'd like: Ipad Mini Home button soldering.  Here's where it gets real bad/funny: all of the videos that I viewed never mention needing to replace the home button; they just show how to take it apart, and put it back together so I didn't think anything of it at until I reached that stage (too late!) So no I have to either find someone local who knows how to do this (no luck so far due to it being pretty new (and super difficult) or send it off and spend some $$$. Here's the best part.... the part that you have to solder the new digitizer to (a circuit) ISNT EVEN AVAILABLE TO PURCHASE SEPARATELY!!! So if anything happens to the super delicate wiring in the removal process, YOU CANT EVEN FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!What confuses me the most is that the ease of which their glass screens break is no secret and is not difficult to have happen.... SO WHY WOULD THEY MAKE IT SOOO DIFFICULT TO FIX ONE OF THE MOST COMMON PROBLEMS!?!?!So, if you have or get an IPad Mini and experience any issue dealing with the Home Button (not responsive, intermittent, stuck, etc.) or the digitizer/glass screen (not responsive, scratch, cracked, or shattered.... all which are fairly common... I wouldn't suggest doing this on your own and be prepared to open the wallet. Most online services offering to replace the digitizer are around $125.I hope that, maybe in the next generation, this is fixed/addressed. For something soo common, this needs to be a plug in solution...not having to find a specialist to solder it back together. My suggestion would be to 1) get a very durable/strong case (otterbox?) and 2) DONT USE THE IPAD UNTIL ITS IN THE CASE!!  ((our case was in the mail heading towards us...))!###Got this on time which was ok but i received it with scratches on the screen and there was no charger, earbuds or anything else with it but the iPad and that was received in a damaged box. When i opened up the iPad it had a huge crack and it didn't work at all so i bought a brand new iPad. Also i couldn't ship it back!###I am not an ipad mini expert and for bouth this one for my husband, I didnt know the difference, Thank God the seller was kind enough to take it back. I need to get the other one instead!###I wonder if the screen is now not glass, but a thin plastic film how that will hurt Corning glass?Will this thin plastic film be used on new TV sets?A company called research frontiers controls the rights to controlling the effect on light passing through the plastic film and should benefit from this change .Refr is on the Nasdaq if you are interested. I own options on2'500 shares, and should be considered a person with a profit motive.!###It lasted just the time the company specify it will last to come. Apple isapple so theprodct should not me rated!###i ordered a black one and recieved a white one, but its cool, not really a big problem (filter guidelines)!###This has got to be Apple's greatest product yet. Not only does it shield me from the fiery breaths of Medieval dragons but it also allows me to time travel. It also has a pop out toaster and waffle maker. Keep in mind that you have to have your own bread and waffle mix because Apple likes to give you one part but charges you an arm and a leg for the other part.  The only complaint I have it that it doesn't come with proprietary arms to do my dishes and give me back rubs.!###Best seller I have ever dealt with.  He extended the return for this iPad mini, because I was giving it for a gift.  Very honest and great communication.  The product was just as described and the shipping was super fast.  Excellent seller.!###I got this for my son for Christmas. He absolutely loves it. Although he has to use WIFI, it does all that he wanted it for. The size is great, and it is very clear. Of course, like all iPad products, it isn't good in the sunshine, but it's Fabulous in the dark. I will be buying one for myself now.!###Love the versatility of the iPad mini.  I highly recommend this product. Awesome amount of storage and ease of use.!###This is a Christmas gift for my daughter. She unexpected this, but I'm shure that she love it!Apple products are always a good decision..!###I can not give a review as it is a gift for my granddaughter for xmas.I am sure she will like it.!###I owe apple big time for potty training my 2 yr old. We bought it to put a few learning games and some movies to keep my daughter occupied on long trips and when we go out to dinner (rarely) Not only did it serve it's purpose, but my daughter LOVED her iPad so much that we used it as a reward for going potty, in less than 2 weeks we ditched the diapers and we were 100% potty trained. I personally love the ipad for virtually everything. Movies, games, online shopping, music, etc. The battery life is phenomenal! Now that my daughter thinks its all hers I will probably be picking up an iPad air... no Droid for me!!###I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Only wish I had gotten it 3G capable, otherwise it's just perfect. There are only a few instances where I'm not near wifi, so I'm still covered almost everywhere I go!!!!!!!!###I love this Ipad.  I own every generation of the fat Ipads and when they came out with a smaller size I thought it was stupid.  But I never judge on idea unless i experience it.  To my surprise I loved the Ipad Mini the moment it was on my hand.  It was extremely light and nice feel to the hands. Now having to own a Ipad Mini, I actually carry this one with me at all times.  I use it to watch movies and many other things, it is the perfect size for someone who is always on the go.  Battery life is amazing as well.  I went to Japan with this Ipad and was able to watch all the movies I loaded on there with 90% battery life on a 14 hour flight!!###I've been an apple fan for a while. We still even have our fist generation iPad 16 GB. When I first saw that apple released a smaller iPad, I thought it was kind of pointless. I was recently given this iPad mini from my employees and I've been pleasantly surprised by how much I have enjoyed using it. The size, weight and performance is just right. I can't complain. I use it every day for surfing the web. The battery life has been great. I picked up a knock-off Smart Cover case for $9 on Amazon and I'm all set. I highly recommend it.!###Wow - this is really cool!  I bought this to process credit card sales online and it does so many cool things besides.  I'm not terribly computer savvy but Apple is very user friendly.!###A year into owning the first generation iPad Mini, I can say it was a great buy for myself and as a gift for my father.Pros:I've never owned a tablet before the iPad Mini. I had toyed with getting a Nexus 7, but the Google Play Store just didn't have enough tablet specific apps. I owned an iPhone so I chose to stay within that ecosystem. The app selection for the iPad/iPad Mini is great. The non-retina display is not a concern for me. The display is still very good looking though. The size and weight feel great in your hands and is a great in-between of a smartphone and a laptop. I particularly like the aluminum back. It's cold to the touch when you first start using it, but then adapts to your hand temperature. It's solid hardware and feels very premium.Cons:Speaking of premium, the price. When I bought the iPad Mini in 2012, it was $330 and the processor was already a year behind at that point. The price point as of late 2013 is $299, with the new iPad Mini at a whopping $399. The hundred dollar difference between the 7.9 inch iPad Mini and the 9.7 inch iPad Air makes it difficult to decide. Especially since the new Nexus 7 is only $230 and Amazon Kindle Fire at $139. The processor is still OK, but it can lag on graphic intensive games. If you don't play much of those, you'll be fine. Movies, Youtube, etc all play extremely well.Rating: 5 out of 5.Recommended: Yes.  If you decide to shell out money for an Apple product, you're buying into a great app ecosystem and great hardware that you'll be happy with.!###I give the mini 5 stars. It has everything that it's larger sibling has but just in a pint size easy to hold body. Much bigger than my iPhone 5 but not so big and heavy that I can't use it with one hand. Great for reading, email, photo editing. It is my primary business tool for my small business.!###We got this for my mom who has avoided computers forever. She loves that she can download books from all available apps. She takes it everywhere, so she always has downloaded reading material. She also loves the camera and many of the different creative camera apps. The 10 hrs of power you get from a full charge have been more than sufficient for her. The standard 16gb. also seems like plenty of storage for her. But there are other options if you feel your needs are greater. This is very easy to use, and great for someone who may be intimidated by, a full size computer, or laptop, with the ability to do almost all of the same things.!###Bought this so my daughter would stop using my regular iPad to play all her games but liked it so much I've sort of switched and use this one and give her my old one!!###I love this thing.. They are a little pricey, for their size.. But it Works! I just wish Apple would make ICloud and ITunes a little more user friendly...The Mini is awesome!!!###what's not to love about an ipad... and the 32 GB seems better.  my daughter got he 16 and now wishes for more...!###Who wouldn't love to have an iPad?!? It links with my iPhone and work email/contact/caledar info. This was a great purchase. Everyone in the family has been enjoying it.!###Not being personally knowledgeable about this item, I ordered at the request of my grandson, and he is very pleased with this item.!###I've got to say, I LOVE iPad mini!!  I've used a regular-sized iPad, and I've go to say, this is WAY cuter, but also WAY more convenient!!!!!!  It's not too bulky to carry around all day, and it's got all the capabilities of the regular iPads.  LOVE!!!###I'm actually an android user, still prefer the android way. But this hardware is really something. Increadibly fast, very satisfied with the weight. ios7 is amazing.!###My wife got an iPad 2 as a gift. She has an iPhone as well so she let me use the iPad 2 and I was immediately hooked! The problem with with iPad 2 is it's too big and heavy. So I got myself an iPad mini it's much lighter and easier to lounge at the couch with.Also we have a small house so I thought maybe this could replace our PC. So now we no longer have a home PC. I can do everything I need with my iPad mini. Banking, surfing, bill paying, watch shows etc.Thank you Apple for the mini!It's much better than the regular old bulky iPad!###This is great it is simple to use and there was a charger included in the box with it too!###Not happy I have to find a place to find out what is wrong the sound is gone and it is moveing VERY slow!!###It seems to be ok. I didn't use it since I bought it for a present for my husband. It looks great!###ipad mini will not start, I had to take at the technical service does not start because the battery,  they cheated me , everything you sell is a scam, now I have no ipad  thieve!###Since an iPad is just a bigger version of the iPod Touch, wouldn't the iPad mini be just iPod Touch upgraded?!###There are so many things a laptop can do, but laptops are bulky and usually heavy. (ex: can't exactly stuff it into any of my purses)But with the iPad, I can easily throw it into my purse, just like a book!However, the iPad can't work exactly how a computer can.It can't stand up on it's own, it doesn't have a keyboard either. (I'm writing a book) So, if I go to a cafe to work, it's difficult to work with.I had to copy and paste things I written to other places like my email and that turned out not easy to do either.I couldn't work with multiple apps at the same timeI couldn't open multiple windows at the same timeif I wanted to listen to music and change to another song on the iPad while I was working on my writing, it would be easier if I was able to use multiple windows, just as if I was working on a real desktopThough I love my iPad mini, the amount of money I paid for it isn't meeting my expectations!###As an iPad alone, this is nice enough, and I have no complaints. But we bought it to use 4G with S*****,  in order to use Square in our business. That aspect has been an unqualified disaster. It has never worked properly, and S*****-Apple kept telling us that the problem is with the other, and oh by the way we don't have your account, they have it.We have now lost well over a thousand dollars of billable hours, shuttling between Apple and S*****. So, while this is cute as a button, we can't recommend it for any kind of serious work.Update: We cancelled the S***** service, which was fine until we got our monthly bill.Us: "We cancelled this service"S***** "We have no record of that."Us "But we have the cancellation number".S***** "We have no record of that."!###The IPad Mini itself is bat crazy great !!!It's an upgrade for my daughter from her IPod.I was disappointed that the IPad Mini was clearly advertised as &#34;NEW&#34;, and I in fact received a used IPad Mini.!###It's a small iPad without Retina.  Battery lasts.  Best thing about it really is how light it is.  Cheaper than full size.  Parent's like it for travel.!###Regardless of the hype Microsoft has given their new Windows platform, the iPad is still the best. I bought the mini to replace my old iPad and after comparing tablets, I stayed with Apple. I love the mini for a number of reasons, primarily because of the operating system and ease of use. Windows is just not as good.!###I am a happy Apple fan. I have a MacBookPro & an iPhone 4S, 16 GB. A priority for me is having products that do what I want understandably, reliably & w convenient, knowledgable & quick tech support if needed. I have found Apple products are that way so didn't even consider any other brands.I find that the specs for this & the iPhone 4S are somewhat similar--processor, camera, etc & I got the 16 GB version for both.I was using my MacBookPro for business & to show a presentation at the table. But, while very light for a laptop, it still was big to carry around.I find that now I don't even turn on my Mac every day. I can browse email & the web & a lot of apps just fine on it.Since I'm new to the iPad, I wasn't sure just how useful it would be. Well it is. It makes a good e-book reader. Although only have a couple so far. I got the Kindle app since one e-book I wanted needed that format.I also is a very nice size to carry around w me. I got a new purse that is not large but has a pocket on the outside into which the iPad mini in its case just fits.I also like that I can do iMessages on all 3 of my devices & while I can do things on the iPhone, the iPad mini is much easier to read & type on.I bought the Belkin case at BestBuy that looks like a pad folio w snap in holder for the iPad. So its not totally obvious that its an iPad, looks nice & both protects & provides a nice stand for it that works well on table or on my lap.I'm also using my iPad mini rather than a hard cover bible for church, using the YouVersion app. The combo is agile enough to jump around to different passages & easier to carry.As one who is a touch typist, I was concerned about whether I would need an external keyboard, but have found that I can type pretty well on it. Not quite usual fingering--more like several finger typing but have been able to use it to take notes at seminars & meetings. This using the Pages app. I also have purchased the Keynote Ap thinking I would use it, but really use the free Slide Shark to handle a co presentation.  I'm thinking of purchasing the Numbers app. Need to review how to sync the Apple apps between the mini & my Mac.As far as connectors, don't have the myriad of Apple accessories that some are concerned about. I had previously gotten the InCase car charger from the Apple store for my iPhone (after the one I got at Walmart quit working after 8 mo). This is the kind that is in 2 pieces so one plugs into the car power outlet & then any usb plug can plug into it.  So if my iPad Mini needs charging, I can use its cord to plug into the outlet & charge in the car.Also, I bought it at the Apple Store & since I had One to One through my Mac, I could use it to learn my iPhone & my iPad. Unfortunately having recently moved to Portland, OR, the Apple Store is way across town so not as convenient as I was used to. Haven't been there yet. I need to go as sometimes I tap to close a Safari window or click on a link w no response. So should get the touch screen checked (as I did w the touchpad on my previous MacBookPro where they find certain portions not responsive & fixed it, quickly.Speaking of the Apple Store, I like the fact that I have that resource--even though now its less convenient than it was.  This is 1 reason that I like Apple products. If there is an issue,  I remember w other devices (Windows computers & Windows phone) where the service was not very good. My windows phone had major issues (couldn't properly handle daylight savings time & other issues). Verizon people were nice but didn't really help so got runaround & some never did get answers.  They knew a lot of basic stuff, but now w smart phones, they can't know all of them well.Also previously w a device from 1 co & OS from another & then other apps, I have gotten the run around w each blaming the other & being caught between them. Or maybe not even blaming the other but having to make multiple contacts to get an answer.I have found Apple Stores to be on top of things & their service turn around time is very fast--several times faster than they had promised.The other thing w Apple products that I have found is that they just work. I've had hardware & software failures w other computers & phones. I got my iPad Mini I think in early March. Working fine. My iPhone 4S is 22 mo old & working fine (they had to do a reset & upgrade to iOS6 1 time, quickly taken care of at the Apple Store).So for me, having products that do what I want, reliably & w tech support that quickly takes care of any issues that may arise is very important. I had not found that level of reliability & tech support w other products. I expect the same level of continued reliability & service if needed w my iPad Mini.!###Pros: Lightweight but solid-feeling.  Easy to hold in one hand.  Lots of cool apps at the App Store.  Operating system runs fast and rarely crashes.  Movies from Amazon Prime look awesome.  I have pretty much stopped using my PC now that I have this.Cons: High price- I got the 32 gig at Meijer when they were having 35% off if you open a charge account, otherwise I couldn't have afforded it.  Crappy sound through speakers, but ok with earbuds.  Rear facing camera not nearly as high quality as front facing camera.!###I love this mini-iPad. It's small enough to hold in one hand (as compared to the standard iPad) and yet big enough to actually see and use (as compared to my iPhone).I keep it next to my favorite chair so I can check and respond to email without having to go to my desktop computer.!###My iPad one original died. Even the 'geniuses' bar couldn't revive it. I didn't know what to do. I was addicted. My only complaint with the original was that it was too big to handily fit on my person. The mini gave me that quality, and more. Additionally, it has 'Siri' and two cameras, which of course the original didn't. The price was half a replacement and all my old aps worked fine. It was easy to pick up where I left off, I just downloaded my latest back-up and it was like I had my original back with all the extra niceties mentioned above. It came overnight, I barely went through withdrawal.!###This is worth it. Plain and simple. RETINA or NO RETINA...who cares! I does exactly what I need it to do and its size and weight are the cherry on top. I only wish I would have bought the 32GB instead, but 16GB is doing me fine for the most part, just have to stream and email certain things instead. I think its for the best though, keeps me focused (which is why I bought this, for work mainly). But I love it!!###I've always loved the iPad, but never bought one for myself because it wasn't really portable enough. I'd rather just use my laptop or my iPod. But now my little iPad is the perfect medium-size for everything that I do. I was at first disappointed that it didn't have a Retina display (most likely will come out in a new model), but honestly I hardly notice. The screen is much sharper than the iPad 2 display. You only see the pixels if you look really hard, but from a normal viewing distance it is unnoticeable. I love my iPad, definitely recommended!!###After half-heartedly trying to get used to touch screen on an iPad (I found it too heavy to hold and use).  But when I got my hands on the iPad mini, well - what a difference.  It operates very close to the same way as the iPad, same apps, etc.  I don't like Mac Mail on the iPad, and have been looking for another email client that I can use with both iMac and iPad.  Tried to do this with Gmail and that was a total disaster.You can't carry the Mini in your pocket (too big) but it slips into any number of places in a carry on back pack, or just carry in your hand.  The picture isn't retina - but it doesn't make any difference at this size - the picture is fantastic.Beware that some of the Apps are cloud based (on any tablet), and when you are out of reach of wi-fi - you flat don't have the app!!!  I learned the hard way on a recent trip.  I don't maintain any phone based connectivity, so I bought this iPad mini with just wi-fi, and find that I don't have trouble finding a hotspot (I use Boingo, and it really helps).Small, but not iPhone small, light (much lighter than the iPad), great picture, tons of apps, great battery life - it is a winner.!###My daughter loves it....I was the best dad ever that day...lol.  She uses it all the time.  Perfect for that 25 and under gen.!###I own an iPad with Retina display but as portable as it is, I needed something just a little smaller that I could slip into my purse and pull out whenever I wanted to read a book.  I have been looking at the Kindle and the Nexus 7.  I was like two seconds away from snagging a Nexus 7 when I decided to research the iPad Mini.It seemed the better choice for me as my entire digital media library was on iTunes and I didn't want to have to rebuild it on another platform.  If you use the same iTunes account, all of your iOS devices sync up and you don't have to maintain libraries on multiple devices.I was surprised at the screen.  While not a Retina display, it is the iPad 2 screen resolution shrunk down in a smaller package, giving Retina like sharpness.I loaded up the Kindle app and I was in business!  I haven't found anything I can do on my full sized iPad that I can't do on the mini except full 1080p HD video, but It is hard to tell the difference on the smaller screen in 720p HD.The only negative I can see is that streaming video buffers a little slower on this device when compared to the full sized iPad, but that is just the differences in the hardware itself.I think this is a great unit for someone looking for full functionality in a more portable package.!###THe boyfriend was completely in shock as much as i was on the great price that i got for his ipad he is definately enjoying reading his comics!###Not only did they ship my product on Christmas so I would get it before the expected delivery date, but they went above and beyond when there was a mishap with the cord and charger. Its not about things going wrong (its technology something is always likely to go wrong) its about how the company handles these things. I will def look to them for future purchases and recommend them to others. The only reason I didn't give the product a perfect score is because my new cord and charger is in the mail and i haven't fully been able to use the product yet! Thank you ASB.!###Great product but the seller did not include the ATT sim card.This is a big deal when you pay for an ipad with AT&T service.Amazon is working on the problem for me, will update on results.!###This was a gift for my son and I'am glad I made this move!I recommend this product a lot.!###I bought this for my 6 year old daughter. She uses it all of the time. I've got a good case on it so that if she drops it, it will be protected well. It runs smoothly. It's easy to navigate. The screen is clear and sharp. She loves it. She plays games, takes pictures, watches TV shows on the Disney Channel. There is so much for her to do. It's definitely user friendly and after I set it up, she navigates it on her own with no help. I think I want one for myself.!###The iPad is ok most of the time some times it shuts down a game and goes back to the home screen but over all it's okay.!###First off the iPad mini is much smaller portable. The audio was very good compared to the Kindle which sucks and also you don't even need a Retina display the iPad mini has a very clear screen already. if you want something bigger you should get the iPad but for me I like something portable. Siri works great and writing this review was easy because I just had to voice.  So I think it's kind of big but I like it because kindle sucked and so I'm selling a piece of crap and that iPad mini is better!###I have been wanting an iPad for years, but never could afford one.  When the mini's came out, I finally was able to get one.  I love that this is just like my phone and so easy to use!  Also, I think I like this smaller version better.  It's so quick to load up and happy with all the available apps I can get.  The size is perfect to carry around with you too.  Just perfect!!###It's very good. Everything is perfect. it's cheaper and it has no tax. If i go to apple store, it will cost me more. so, this is good.!###This was a surprise gift for my friend I is very satisfactory to her,but I prefer the regular size ones.!###This size is so convenient, it could be taken anywhere.  The apps and other applications are quite informative and could be used by anyone.  Additionally it was very easy to set up.!###The regular iPad is great, I'm sure, but I wasn't really willing to spend $500+ on a tablet. This was much more affordable, and you get all of the same great features besides the size. Now, I know there are obviously other differences between the two, but coming from someone who isn't super tech savvy... it's basically the same. I love it! The only thing I would say isn't amazing is the sound. Sometimes it's not loud enough when I'm watching Netflix. That's it though! It's great!!###First off I didn't buy it thru Amazon but thru Apple. I already have an iPad3, but its heavy, hard to hold for long periods. I bought the Mini because of its ultra light weight and perfect form factor especially when traveling/commuting. Everything the iPad 3 did, the Mini does. Now my reason for returning it. Let's face it, the retina screen spoils everyone with the high detail, ultra sharp rendering of everything. The Mini's screen resolution, in my opinion, is terrible. Its pixelated, grainy, fonts are NOT sharp but fuzzy, it seriously gave me a headache. I'm near-sighted so I can see everything sharply close up so its not my eyes. I'm going to wait when an Apple retina Mini comes out in the future.!###I like this iPad a lot. It is easy to put in your purse and take with you. I was worried it would be different and I would have a hard time picking up the differences from my laptop but it is very user friendly. I am 63 and only self taught on computer but I have no trouble using it. Great product.!###I lost my iPad and was ready for a mini anyway. So glad I got it.  Fast and easy to use.  I got the WiFi from AT&T and it is great in airports and other areas where no wifi is available.  With a logitech keyboard, I can take notes in classrooms and seminars with ease.  Highly recommend it.!###I just cant put it down. I want to carry it everywhere with me. It is the first iPad in my home and its the most excitement we had as a family over a gadget. Everyone wants one now. I own an iPhone 5 and iPod. I was never interested in an iPad because of size. I considered it to be a big iPhone and debated for months whether I should get an iPad 4 or the mini. I am so happy I got the mini. I really can't see that much difference with the retina. If fact my iPhone 5 looks so small and clustered. It is the best gift I have had since the iPhone. This iPad made me play games again. I stopped playing games on iPhone because of screen size.Pros:The size is perfect.The screen looks greatIt's fastWell madeHas great accessories i recommend Invellop leather case. It's perfect.Battery last long.1000s of great apps.It's Desirable.So far there is nothing that I would call a con.!###I have used Apple for time now. I was in graphic design & web design so Apple Macs great for productivity.Looking for big fun in mini size pad or gaming ipad mini is great. Is like a mini novel book.  Cause I like the idea of portable mini pad fits with the cases and the keyboard in my purse without hassle or extra "stuffing". I can pull out for my niece to watch videos or games on long car travel.I also note that it is a very great for those not familiar with tablets. It very user friendly. Snap it is so friendly my mother can use it and she's not a tech savvy.(recommend a stylus with a point not the ball for writing or drawing or presentation notes).My disappointment however if for my work/productivity. I purposely purchased to use with school and work. I am a teacher that has the interactive site or discovery programs. Major hit is the sites I need for the classroom that require Adobe FLASH support. Also it in my schooling  also requires Adobe FLASH support for my online courses/assignment. Sigh, every so a big block for me. Maybe I missed it that part in my research in Apple iPad Mini with Samsung Galaxy 10.  (oh the galaxy has flash support and already comes with programs as word, powerpoint, ect.)My next discovery  was how heavy I would more storage.My conclusion is based on your needs.!###This is my first iPad. I couldn't decide whether to get the regular size or the mini. So glad I got the mini, it fits much easier in my purse, etc. to take along. What did I ever do without an iPad lol I am so amazed at what all you can do with it and all the apps. and everything synchronizes with my iPhone wow. I guess I am just a middle aged person and this all amazes me.!###This Ipad is great.  It has met all my expectations.  It is light and can be taken everywhere.  The battery power lasts for a long time.  It was shipped in a timely manner. I am very pleased with my purchase and I highly recommend this mini IPad.!###Love my new mini iPad! Great for travel & the Grandkids! It's a Birthday to myself with a little help from my hubby.!###I bought this for Christmas gift for my son and he loves the product.  It's like IPad 2 with smaller size.  Portable and good.  But so over priced.  This is the only issue I have.  I bought it a lot more than the normal price and my friend just bought 8 inch tablet with better spec than the Ipad Mini from Idolian called Mini Studio for less than $200 and it works better than IPad mini.  :-(I'm getting the Mini Studio for my daughter for her birthday since it's a lot more affordable.  But IPad is IPad!  Great!!###Pure quality built product. Looks great and is  the coolest tablet out there. Super light. Display is excellent and apple maximized its screen to have very little border which is a plus.  Battery life seems decent. Processor speed seems to be quick. Able  listen to music and have other programs going.I have another tablet HTC evo 4g tablet and it is also a great tablet. So, I am comparing the mini iPad to that. The size is much better than the full sized iPad. However, it is just a little too big for my hand to hold comfortably for long periods. My HTC is much better sizing in that respect. Also, it is a little slippery but nothing a silicone sleeve can't handle. My biggest gripe is that it doesn't have text reflow and the text starts out tiny in the browser.  The android os leads in that category because no matter how large the text is magnified it reflows to fit the screen. Apple products need a true text reflow. Also, I like how you can customize android's screens in regard to icons and widgets. The mini iPad is is lacking in that area.All in all it is a great tablet and built to high quality standards.!###This is what my 21 year old daughter wanted for Christmas....she is absolutely thrilled with this product.  Not only can she use this tablet for her entertainment, she can also use it for note-tsking in her college classes.!###The iPad mini is a nice device overall, feels solid and my daughter loves the selection of apps. However, the deluge of icons is really confusing and it's very hard to navigate to what I was last doing upon turning the device on. It requires remembering, finding and usually quite a few clicks and typing. Very unintuitive. The iOS 7 is a complete disaster, it is very hard to tell what is a link, what is button, what I can click and what I can't. I am often confused. When I watch photos, it feels like I am in an email. It was very hard to find the url box in the Safari browser. I often can't recognize what is the selected object or link or button. Well there are no buttons or links, only blue text. It is minimalist style to the point of uselessness. It feels like the work of a European preoccupied with style over usability. Very unamerican and very unapple-like. In addition, reading magazines is very unpleasant, requires monthly subscriptions. It is very hard to buy a Bloomberg Markets for $5 like I can on the street. Also each magazine has its own app with different scrolling motions. Some scroll to the right, some scroll down. It is extremely confusing and frustrating. I just want to read magazines and flip from page to page and I kind of like checking out the ads as I browse.Also the content on the iPad is very expensive - movie rentals are north of $5-$6 and some hot titles can fetch $10 per rental. Also the 24 hour rental period is too short. I can rarely watch a movie in one night after coming home tired from work. Especially if the movie is 3 hours. I only got the iPad mini because the app ecosystem is so deep and there are games on it that my daughter wants to play that are unavailable on the Kindle Fire HDX. With the exception of the depth of the App Store, in every respect, the iPad mini is an inferior device to the Kindle Fire HDX.!###BEWARE! APPLE JUST DEACTIVATED MY IPAD MINI 12/12/13 ,FORCING ME TO USE ITUNES ON MY HOME COMPUTER OR THE IPAD WILL NOT WORK!! UNBELIEVABLE!!###The earphones and carjack didn't even work, and the case is cheap. I am never ever buying this product again!###Bought the iPad mini thinking it would be a lot different and faster than my IPad 1st gen. I was very disappointed. If you already own an iPad, it's not worth it. If you don't own an iPad, then go for it. But before here are some things to think about. I was disappointed that the screen had a lot of glitches. From the screen turning off an on, to freezing partial screen shots. I read a few Apple forums, it seems lots of people had these same problems, so it must be a common problem on this iPad. The camera is not so great, but does anyone really use it to take pictures? Anyway, I gave it two stars because 1. It's an iPad and 2. Because its an Apple product, and I love Apple. My suggestion for a person looking to investing an iPad, get a bigger one, and get any older generation. They're all pretty much the same. Yes your Internet page make take 2 seconds longer to load, but seriously, who is counting 2 seconds? And don't worry, the 4 extra ounces of weight isn't going to break your back. Here's an excellent article for a person that already owns an iPad: [...]!###Ok, so you may wonder, Apple only getting two stars!?  So, let me explain. With all the Apple hype out there, I expected this product to WOW me and out shine all the competitors, but it didn't.  Don't get me wrong. It's a good tablet, although it's beginning to feel a bit out dated amongst some of the up and comming competition.  The display is very good.  The speaker audio quality is decent, the display is very nice, but the OS is just ho-hum anymore.  One thing I really don't like is it's size.  You can't really hold the thing in one hand comfortably, and isn't that one of the reasons you buy a tablet smaller than the standard 10&#34; model?  Looking back I wonder if I would have been happier with the Samsung Galaxy Note 8&#34;.!###I Was waiting for this size of iPad is very confortable, fast and light weight, in my bed is nice to read, my daughter loves the sound when her music plays.!###I am in love!!! i orginally own a ipad 2 and loved it but it felt so heavy! i would ALWAYS leave my ipad 2 at home because it felt too heavy in my purse. 1 day i was out and had my ipad 2 with me and literally stopped what i was doing, drove home just to drop off my ipad 2 because it was hurting my shoulders.so when the ipad mini came out i couldnt wait to get it. but i didnt get it right away because after reading reviews many said it was no reason to upgrade from ipad 2 to ipad mini. but i kept thinking about the ipad mini because im like a tablet is made to be mobile not made to be for home use like a pcso i gave in finally and just got this ipad mini!! and i love it.  there is a difference of screen coming from ipad 2 to ipad mini nut you forget about it by feeling its weight. the ipad mini is soo much lighter than the ipad 2 ! i can now finally take my ipad mini with me in my purse and i dont feel the weight of it at allif you re unsure to get the ipad mini from a ipad 2 do it! you wont regret it.i have ios 7 beta on it and its lovely makes it feel like a whole new systemi take this ipad with me 90 percent of the time the only time i dont take it is when im not carrying a purse. it holds everything for me from my grocery list, to schedules, to movies to photos n etcwhen im out waiting i just pull out my ipad mini and im no longer bored!the ipad mini is a great investment go for it! and the reason why i didnt choose other tablets is 1. i already know apple products since i have an iphone n a macbook 2. although other tablets may be cheaper i dont have patience or nerves for there flawsi brought my mother a tablet another brand and just to set it up for her i hated it. the screen was soo not responsive i had to tap so many times that my fingers hurt. a tocuh is suppose to be that, touch screen and easy to touch and apple has that which why i think its more pricer.anyhow im enjoying my ipad mini and i wish i didnt take so long to get it. its the 1st thing i pic up when i wake up and the last thing before i go to sleepi love it and you will too!###This is an iPad 2 on steroids. It's smaller, but faster, has a better camera, and has Siri. Lightweight, fits in a purse or cargo pocket, makes a great GPS device for driving because you can actually see the items on the screen, due to its larger size than any dedicated GPS device. But you'll need a SIM card for live guidance. Otherwise you'll need to plot your course while on wireless somewhere and pull up the saved directions on the way. Or tether it your cell phone if you're able to.This is a great size for kids because its lightweight and the smaller form factor makes it easier for little hands to manage.!###I love it. It has everything my iPad  has and more.  It's lighter too.. No regrets. I am an Apple lover.!###I have an Apple iPad MC707LL/A (64GB, Wi-Fi, Black) 3rd Generation, iPhone 4S, Apple iPod touch 16GB Black/Silver (5th Generation) NEWEST MODEL, and a Apple TV MD199LL/A which through AirPlay integrates programming and iTunes onto my TV.So why buy the iPad mini?For me it was the 5mp iSight camera (1080P video capable), screen size and portability.  The iSight camera takes fantastic photos, and through Photo Stream (enabled on your device) you are able to share up to 1000 photos with others on your network. (Beautiful video quality too!  Get the Action Movie FX app to have a lot of fun posting to Facebook.)  The iPod touch 5th does have the iSight camera too, but a 4" screen, which for me is a tad small to see and edit photos as I would like to do.The mini's 7.9" screen size is very functional for 'on the go' email, photo viewing, games and makes reading my Kindle books (free Kindle app available) much more enjoyable.Overall dimensions of the device make it very slim and lightweight, making slipping it into my purse or backpack a breeze.Height:7.87 inches (200 mm)Width:5.3 inches (134.7 mm)Depth:0.28 inch (7.2 mm)Weight:0.68 pound (308 g)The Apple iPad mini pairs easily with Bluetooth devices like keyboards and headsets too.  I don't really see the point in pairing with a keyboard, as with this screen size typing up a term paper is possible - but not likely.  However, pairing with a stereo Bluetooth headset to enjoy a movie or listen to music works really well and makes for fun entertainment during the morning commute. (Assuming you're not driving!)Facetime (720P) works well on the mini, as does emailing - assuming you have a solid Wifi connection; 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi (802.11n 2.4GHz and 5GHz). NOTE: Many apps and functions of all iOS devices, depend upon Wifi to be enabled and to have a solid connection before they will work correctly.Good news for anyone who wants to enjoy this device.Like the iPad, the mini has accessibility features that allow users with disabilities to use the device.  Including...VoiceOver screen readerGuided AccessSupport for playback of closed-captioned contentAssistiveTouch interface for adaptive accessoriesFull-screen zoom magnificationLarge textOption to invert colorsBuilt-in apps get you started enjoying the mini right out of the box, without having to download apps.  They include...Safari - web browser that's fast and has Google set by default.PhotosApp Store - make sure you have your Apple ID ready to grab free and paid apps.Maps - turn on location in settings to use Wifi for directions.Photo BoothReminders - useful for keeping yourself on track.CameraMailFaceTime - a great alternative to Skype.iTunesMusic - sync with your PC or Mac and make sure 'sync' is checked when you do to upload your music to your device.ClockCalendar - integrates with MS Outlook 2010.Messages - send text, voice or photos to others with 'i' devices, and save on cellular data fees!NewsstandVideosGame CenterContacts - use iCloud to store your contacts, messages, emails, photos and do back-ups.  *Free 5GB of iCloud is yours!NotesSECURITY APP TIP: get the free 'Find My iPhone' app (works with iPads too...) and set up a passcode to limit access to your settings so that this app cannot be disabled should your device be stolen or lost.  By using this free app you are able to locate the device (a general area) when it connects to the Internet.  You can also disable the device so that if stolen, it's not going to be 'enjoyed'!Students, commuters, frequent travelers, and gadget lovers will adore the iPad mini for it's highly portable fun and functionality.Those seeking a tablet for working on spreadsheets or writing a novel, go get an iPad instead.iPad mini cases I like...OtterBox Defender Series Hybrid Case for iPad Mini - Black (77-23834) - for those who want extra 'bump' protection!  The only negative to this one is no 'magnetic' sleep function because it doesn't have a cover, it has a built-in screen protector instead.Snugg iPad Mini Leather Case Cover and Flip Stand with Elastic Hand Strap and Premium Nubuck Fibre Interior ('Distressed' Brown) - Automatically Wakes and Puts the iPad Mini to Sleep - fits well, looks good, and has the sleep/wake feature via a magnetic closure. Well padded, but it doesn't provide the same 'bump and drop' protection as the Otterbox Defender.!###Yes, it doesn't have the retina display but for my uses it doesn't make a lot of difference. Form factor and mobility sold it for me and I couldn't be happier with it.!###I must say that when iPads came out in general I saw no use for them and I am an Apple lover. When I first viewed these in the store, I thought wow it's so small! I must say that now that I've purchased one, it truly is the perfect size. The other one seems too big now! Lol. I will say that it is a bit tough trying to type in landscape mode, but it is doable.Great product.!###A lot easier to use than I expected. it almost does it all! Compact and versitile, battery life is exceptional. I don't know how I managed without it!###I did a lot of research before purchasing the iPad Mini Wi-Fi, and I'm really happy with it--it's exactly what I wanted!!###I have had several nexus phones, currently using the nexus 4. I have the MacBook Air 11 which I love. Was using blackberry tablet, but found it lacking. The iPad 3 is great but cumbersome to lug around. The mini is just the right size.This mini is so superior to the nexus 7, that it makes the 7 feel junky. This renders the web pages faster. The NHL program I use is smoother on the mini than the Nexus, this despite the Nexus having a faster CPU.Highly recommended. Barely fits in my lab coat at work, but at least it won't easily fall out.Battery life while still new, is exemplary.Highly recommended.Higher quality material and OS than the competition.!###My wife love it, she take it every place she go. No live home with outer it. thank you this product.!###I have both this tablet and the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 (32 G with 4 G A.T.&T.)  Both are great tablets.  I bought the &#34;fire&#34; at the beginning of the year after comparing it and the mini.  The Amazon deal was too good to pass up.  The price was the final determining factor when I purchased my Fire HD 8.9 at the beginning of the year. I have had the mini for a few weeks now and I certainly enjoy it.  For one thing, it is easier to slip into my purse.  It is lighter and smaller than the &#34;fire&#34;. The podcasts I enjoy are not available with the &#34;fire&#34;, but I could listen to them on my iPhone 5.  BUT, I must say, overall, I like my Fire HD 8.9 best.  If I were to purchase a tablet today (and could only have one tablet) my choice would be the new Fire HDX 7 inch.  I also would consider the 16G. With cloud storage, it is possible to get along with the 16G.  However, the price difference for the 16G and 32G is certainly more reasonable with the Fire than the iPad. Dollar for dollar Amazon has knocked this one out of the ball park.  The price point is affordable and the tablet is great!!!!  So, watch out Apple, Amazon's Fire HD series is a real competitive contender and certainly more reasonably price.!###Very well made, makes the mini much easier to hold on to.  It does add some considerable weight but that's the price for protection.  Very nice feel and grip.!###The product works great I enjoy using it for my business and personal use. It is an asset to what I'm trying to accomplish!###My daughter loves her IPad mini.  She text me all the time and I didn't have to get involved with buying her a phone!!###Received my Apple iPad Mini late last week. The learning curve, even for someone who is not a computer nerd, turned out to be fairly short. There are some features still to learn but I'm now up and running quite happily (even wrote a blog post). I added a case and peripherals since I'm an avid photographer and also a writer who wants to be able to use the mini for editing and writing while traveling or cafe-ing. I purchased the Logitech Ultrathin keyboard and the UXWrite app (uses Word and Dropbox to work between computer and iPad). Also, for photo downloading: Apple Lightening readers for memory cards and camera direct. If you only take pics with your iPad or iPhone you don't need this. Since the nearest Apple store is 280 miles round trip I researched and ordered everything through Amazon and it was all efficient and quick. And, oh yes, it fits in a medium-sized handbag!!###os produtos foram entregues no prazo e chegaram muito bem armazenados.quanto ao site ta de parab&eacute;ns pela organização dos produtos e facilidade de rastrearo andamento da entrega..!###the product was great everything i was especting, definitely recommended for all you guys who realy need it have fun!###Apple has done it again. This tablet is productivity heaven. Every AP is fantastically utilitarian. It has excellent wireless capabilities. The settings are fairly easy to manage. I love using I Tune U for taking college classes for free. Every AP works well unlike other operating systems, there are rarely any glitches. The battery last long even with constant use. The updates are not obstructive in nature. Every time I put it down I can't wait to pick it back up. I also like the fact that I can use Sprint data plan on a month to month bases and it's prorate if I only use a percentage of the allotted amount. So far there seems to be no cons to speak of.  I highly recommend this item.!###The mini is samller than the original, but is easier to use and handle.  Love the facetime feature along with video camera.!###Does everything the big bulky does in a nice compact size.  Fits in my coat pocket.  Absolutely recommend this over any tablet!!###I love APPLE products for one, and I really love my new iPad mini.  Easy to just put in my purse and go.  With my laptop, it's like packing a small suitcase.  Battery life is great.  I would recommend his over the standard larger iPad just due to the more compact size, weight and user friendly.!###Apple is setting the tone for future products. This iPad mini is one such product. Fast as ever,get on line in a nano second. If your a serious thinker get the 64 gig. You can't lose. Perhaps consider an open box one as I did. I saved about 80.00. Since it  was an open box I checked with apple about it. You can bye an extended warranty 99.00 only if its been purchased with in 29 days. They check the serial number. Then register it in your name. The place where I bought mine was JayBrokers.com. It came to me just about brand new. Jaybrokers is a 3rd party therefore you don't pay tax. Plus amazon will give you free shipping. Go for the open box and save. It's a risk but you really can't lose. Jonathan RV!###I have had my mini for over a month now and I still love it as much as the first day I bought it. I did drag my feet a bit b4 purchasing because of all &#34;talk&#34; about the lack of a Retina display. I can tell you without hesitation that this has never bothered me in the least and yes I have another device with a Retina display. If you are holding back like me because of all the hyperbole about the absence of one your missing out on an awesome device.Pros:Battery life is amazingPortability factor (I take it with me everywhere and it has never been a chore)Screen (yes despite it not being Retina it is superbly clear)Everything else with the one exception noted below.Cons:No flash for the camera.!###I have received my mini really fast, in 7 days from the purchase, on APOE, in perfect condition, well packed. As no one mentioned this or I have not found a review to state this, I wish to make the mention that at the moment I am using my mini with an Etisalat SIM card and it works like a charm on 3G, so the AT@T mini is not carrier locked, information useful for the non-US buyers. Very proud with my mini, the display, even if is not "retina" is great, beyond expectations. Enjoy your mini's.!###iPad's are, as you would expect any Apple product to be, Excellent.  Superior in every way; design, craftsmanship, ease of use, and of course the apps.  The iPad mini which I own satisfy s all my tablet needs.  Look no further.!###Love it so much I traded my android phone in for the iPhone 5!  Fits in my purse. Great response time. Awesome picture and sound.!###The same great functionality and applications of iPad in a perfect size.The smaller display is enought for most tasks and much better to read on bed or to carry for a meeting.!###Fun use it every day in it I I I iiii I I I I I I I I I I I!###This slightly smaller version of the ipad is perfect for being held in one hand while typing with the other.  It has everything the big ipad has except retina display - and I haven't missed that at all on this little baby.  I take it with me everywhere because it is my connection to the world, my business, blog, calendar, camera, pictures, notes, grocery lists, video camera, voice recorder, Holman's study Bible (and two other Bibles), current books I'm reading, online classes, and this list could go on and on for pages!  I thought about this purchase forever before I made it because I hate buying something and then regretting in after I get it.  With the  Apple iPad Mini (32GB) - I have NO regrets!!###The first few days we were very frustrated because we were new to apple technology and we couldn't get anything to work.  With a little time to work it out and some help from friends, we are comfortable with it.  Now we fight each other for time on it.!###I LOVE IT!!! IM ON IT RIGHT NOW!!  :D Works great, my new BEST FRIEND!Was fast delivery. Was exactly what I ordered. I have absolutely no complaints.

I take it everywhere.!###I am just now on the cusp of what this thing can do. The best part is that I can hold it and type at the same time. It fits in my purse, and it runs FAST! Never have had any issues with it, and I've had it since Christmas.!###Convenient. Highly recommend! Fits in purse but bigger than phone so easier to read than iPhone. Cheaper than iPad! I cloud for family calendar sinc.!###So much better than the standard iPad! The form factor of the Mini is exactly what I have been waiting for, and it will be a gadget that I will keep for a long time. If it breaks, I'll get another one!!###I bought the mini as a gift for my wife.  She loves it.Why the mini? Because it ergonomically better v.v. less fatigue when hand held, particularly for users with smaller hands.  The CPU responsiveness is good, the screen is sharp with crisp refresh, networking is a cinch to set up, and touch controls while seemingly  less sensitive than a large screen do afford good digital resolution.My wife has been using the iPad at home and on the job.  When used at home, she scans the news and researches topics for future lessons.  At work, she as example used a clever wave motion app to demonstrate physical principles of wave motion to her students.  Predictably, a third of her students had downloaded the app onto their iPhones within 5 minutes ... that's engagement! And, that she's using the iPad to demo scientific principles in the classroom ... very cool per her students.I think this gift earned a few extra brownie points, or at least one get out of the doghouse credit.!###Fast, simple, smart, fun, lightweight, dont have Bad luck but have a cloud no the top!This buy is a gift of my mother in your birthday... She have 60 years and she hope learn your emailsIn the ir romm.Se open the box, setting the ipad, connetct the wifi... And enjoyTahonas steve jobs...!###It is all I need. I am loving it. I wish I could have gotten one sooner.. the graphic are wonderful. Thank You!###Nuff said, right?It's an iPad...but mini....perfect size actually...not too big, not too small...I use it for business...works great!!###The iPad mini is a must have.  Hands down.  It is beautiful, aesthetic, easy to use, and intuitive.  There are more than 300,000 apps designed specifically for it and they work beautifully on the high resolution screen.  While it is not Retina, this does not make it any less of a good screen.  It is crisp, clear, and responsive.  The fact that it fits in one hand also ads a level of portability to it that the iPad 4 does not offer at this point.  It is extremely light and thin, as well.  Overall, its aesthetic and simple design, thin and light architecture, and wonderful screen make it a must buy for future tablet owners.!###Why would you settle for something that "might" offer a similar quality or user experience?  I tried a Nook tablet and really disliked it.  I got the iPad mini 16GB Wi-Fi black version for Christmas.  I've been using it a couple months and couldn't be happier.  It performs flawlessly.  The graphics and screen are on-par with any other tablet I've seen.  The one flaw people point out with the iPad mini is the non-Retina display, but I find no fault with the screen.  I have had every iPhone and an iPad 2 and the iPad mini is my favorite Apple product yet.  I don't need the bigger screen of the iPad 4.  I would say anyone desiring a tablet should just go with the best and avoid issues with the complexity of Android or small app market with Nook or Amazon.!###I've purchased this for doing some reading. I have a lot of material in PDF and I wanted to have a good tablet to read on, this is a really awesome tablet for doing that. About the screen, is true, is not a retina display but it doesn't suck at all you can do reading and everything you want to without any kind of issue because of the screen resolution. The apple integrated apps for doing reading and other stuff are really great, the iBook app is awesome for reading PDF you don't need to download anything else is right out of the box. The only problem that I had is that I own a Galaxy SIII and is really shocking how closed an limited you feel when you go from android to iOS, the system is not open at all, is like apple already limited the user to use the tablet the way they want you to use it and not the way you want to use it, you cannot download any material (music, videos, etc) directly from the internet, if u want to do that u can download it from your computer and transfer it to your ipad using itunes. EVERYTHING you want to do you have to doing from itunes, that's the downside. On the other hand the tablet is simply beautiful, super light, super well constructed, super comfortable to use I can't get tired of using it.!###El iPad Mini me parece espectacular, muy intuitiva, con el tama&ntilde;o exacto com para leer mientras viajo, la pantalla perfecta para navegar en internet.Lo recomiendo, sobre todo para las personas que viajan.!###The only issue I've found is the battery doesn't last as long as I'd hoped! Have to charge it often... & since I use it a lot it's kinda inconvenient :))!###This product totally met my expectations. Way to go Apple.

Envi&oacute; en el tiempo requerido. Comprado desde Venezuela.!###got this for my wife ( B - day ) present.  when it comes to tablets i could go for any brand really as long as it is functional. Except my wife wanted an ipad and since it arrived before her birthday i was able to surprise her with it.  when it comes to gifts for that special someone you really cant low ball it or substitute.!###This is my 4th iPad (2 1st generation and one second generation). The title of the review says most of it: I am as happy with the mini as the others; and it is a good step up from the 1st generation. The smaller size makes it easier for travel and things like flying. That said, you do need to think about the size of the tablet and how you are going to use the mini. Typing takes some additional getting used to: in portrait it is wider than an iPhone and hard to hold and use thumbs. In landscape it's smaller and harder to &#34;touch-type&#34;.!###Product was brand new as advertised. Love the mini ipad. It has become my go to device. Would certainly recommend.!###I love it.Despite its humble specifications it performs very well.Deducted 1 star because I find the memory options expensive.!###Bought it for my daughter.  she loves it  It should last for a long time because of the amount of memory I bought.  I hope/!###The best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I love it  Dose not crash at all  Worth it people  :).  Its its its.  It is jailbreaking fun.  I dont make any sense SORRY!###Hi the I pad mini is the best tool/PCM out thereWorks fine looks new 64gb is a lot of space to put all my stuff onThank you again!###I bought this for my 8 year old son and he never gets to play with it- the whole family enjoys playing with the iPad mini!###as expected, my son is enjoying his IPad Mini, fit our expectation and will recommend to anybody, thanks Amazon we are enjoying it!###Me encanta mi ipad es genial se las recomiendo es comoda y muy util me ha servido para muchas cosas!###I'm so excited my iPad came so quick I got it the next day although the case wasn't ready to be sent I so appreciate that my main order was still sent out super quick faster than I expected and packaged very well. My kids use it more than I do until I get used to it at least but I love all the free games that are available for my 6 and 11 year old as well as books. It keeps them super entertained in the car or keeps them off the tv :) I am lovin it and slowly becoming addicted to amazon.......thank you very much!###The device is easy to use. I use it for educational purposes. I use iBooks for textbooks.  The app store to supplies plenty of choices for educational games for my children. I use the iPad to help coordinate my homeschool.The device is worth the money! I waited a long time to make this purchase and am very satisfied. Excellent graphics, super quick response, love the gestures capability!!###Love this iPad mini. Fast processor with strong WiFi antenna. Nice camera. Tons of applications. Going to get it for only $329 @ Best Buy though.!###I was very impressed with the product and glad that it came a day after Christmas. It was unopened and in good condition as well as a great gift. Very pleased with the mini and recommend it to everyone who doesn't have a tablet already.!###Product was like it said,brand new in box..Ordered it Friday before Christmas Eve by noon & it was received Monday,Christmas Eve around 5:00 pm cst as promised. Very pleased with shipping & the item!###The size is much nicer than the full size iPad. It's much easier to hold and much lighter.  Not a slouch on speed either!###I have owned every edition of iPad. Each one has had 64GB storage plus Wi-Fi. Each "old" iPad has been passed down to lawyers in my office where it has been an essential tool in our practice. In our office all of our computers, save one for very specific software reasons, are Macs. One of my associates has even bought his own Apple MacBook Pro MD101LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop (NEWEST VERSION). Our phones are Apple iPhone 4S 64GB (White) - AT&T and my own Apple iPhone 4S 64GB (Black) - AT&TThe effect of all of these iPads and OSX computers has been to take full advantage of iCloud and numerous critical apps such as Square, RocketMatter, Lexis Advantage, WD2Go, Dropbox, TrialPad and Sign My Pad. Our Mac office is essentially a model for Apple products as high end business tools in the legal profession.For the past several months I been constantly asked if I was ever going to acquire an iPad Mini. Until this past week, when I began to reconsider, my answer was emphatic-NO!A smaller iPad was not likely ever to serve as an everyday tool, one that could replace a laptop in many (but not all) situations. I have been critical of WiFi only iPads believing that by maintaining access to the Internet is critical when traveling, in WiFi free courthouses and opponents' law offices. I have also insisted on 64GB iPads believing that storage should never be an issue, particularly as we move into an era where FaceTime promises to reinvent video testimony.So what am I doing buying the lowest end iPad Apple sells? The answer is that not all users are created equal. Our office manager is uniquely involved in all aspects of the practice. She monitors my emails (and I might add she is my wife so this isn't as dangerous as it sounds), reviews accounting issues including billing and time keeping. At times she has simply taken my Apple iPad MD371LL/A (64GB, Wi-Fi + AT&T 4G, White) 3rd Generation when I get home for these uses instead of sitting with her Apple iMac MD093LL/A 21.5-Inch Desktop (NEWEST VERSION) that is our home computer.The reality is she is primarily monitoring the life of our firm, not creating pleadings and doing trial prep. When this occurred to me, I realized that the smallest iPad mini was the best way to provide her with the same 24/7 access to the file server at the office (using WD2Go) that we all enjoy and need. On the other hand, she is unlikely to need a 4G LTE connection since most of her work is done either in the office or at home. That said, as I considered this, her Apple iPhone 4S 32GB (White) - AT&T is a personal hotspot, a capacity which is useful for those moments Internet access is necessary but unavailable on with tablets or laptops. 16GBs is in fact a massive amount of storage for most purposes and users.The iPad mini is light and while offering less "display real estate" is as fully functional as its big brothers. I loaded it from my App Store account with the essential apps for her needs. If you are wondering about cost, the additional cost is zero at least for the number of iOS devices-four-now on my App Store account. For those who would consider buying a cheaper non-iOS tablet, the costs of apps can be significantly more than the price differential between the iPad mini and smaller Droid tablets.While the iPad mini does not offer Retina Display like my new iPad, none of the older iPads my associates use do either. The look, feel and functionality of this tablet is pure iPad.Simply put under the right circumstances the iPad mini is a reasonable and economical choice for a Mac heavy law practice.!###The Mini is as light and handy as Apple advertised it to be! It can do everything 'big brother' can do! It totally met my expectation. It is fast and sleek, a lean, mean machine, easy to understand. Shipping experience with AJ Wholesale was awesome.!###First of all, this is cheaper at the apple store, even Walmart has it for the same price as the apple store, so if you want this please save yourself some money and buy elsewhere!I don't know where to begin, I guess I should say I am using my iPad Mini to type this review and I find it easy to use to type. I really love this thing, it's slim and light and in have all my apps synced to my iPhone without a problem, which makes me happy, I could not do that on my kindle fire.I love the apple operating system, it's always smooth and just flat out works well.Being said that I have an iPhone(4S) I am a little disappointed the mini doesn't have the crisp retina display, but I'm sure it would be a bit more expensive if it did, and it is already a bit overpriced to begin with. But if you use it to organize your life like I do, the price for a smooth running system is well worth it. I'm sure they will be coming out with the mini retina by march or November 2013, I might upgrade when the 3rd gen. comes out and let my husband or my kid have this oneI LOVE APPLE :-)!###As a first-time iPad owner, I am very pleased. I think it is safe to say that I am officially obsessed with the newest addition to my little Apple family:) Having small hands, this is the perfect sized tablet for me and its sleek design makes transportation a breeze. I also wasn't aware that Siri was on the iPad mini and was ecstatic to finally meet her;) The first thing I noticed when I saw it in person was that it is not as small as depicted online. I was worried about it being too &#34;mini&#34; but it is noticeably bigger than the iPhone 4 (about 4 times bigger) and significantly smaller than the normal iPads.One thing I was slightly disappointed with was the App Store. I found that several of my most-used apps on my iPhone were not available for the iPad. However, I am still glad I treated myself to a little post-Christmas gift and I'm excited to explore my new iPad mini!If it wasn't evident already, I would of course recommend this iPad to anyone, especially to those with smaller hands.!###This product is great me and my wife have one she has the white and I have the black 64GB + wifi+ network the speed is blazing the clarity is crystal clear and we have crappy Internet speed and its fast I could only imagine it on a faster network but if your looking to invest in this product GO BIG because I find myself getting more and more useful apps please treat yourself it'll be worth it you'll forget the price lol!###My husband told me I could have one for Christmas- an iPad 4 or a mini. I chose the 4 in the beginning, because i was sure the mini would be too small. I have played with my husbands kindle fire, and it was just to small. I figured I could have no real use for anything smaller than the original iPad I already had. Then I started researching, and found out that the mini seemed to be a good choice. I went in and compared the two side by side, and was amazed at how much I loved the mini. So I changed my mind and asked for the white 32gb mini instead. I regret nothing! This thing is awesome! It's so thin and light, and just all around beautiful. Much more portable than the larger iPad, but I didn't lose out on the ability to see it, either. It's nowhere near the small, impossible to see mess that is the kindle fire. And the white one makes me think of both high tech future technology, and a white chocolate slab. Both are wonderful :-)!###I have the Kindle Fire which is fantastic! I wanted to try the IPad Mini for work purposes.  I keep my books (and most of my things) on my Kindle and have used the IPad for work, games and searches.  Still prefer the Kindle actually.!###Just what i was looking for.  Beyond expectations. Great product and good quality.  It is very user friendly and easy to use.!###I really love this iPad.  It's compact enough that I can carry it in my purse.  Very easy to set up and navigate.  I bought a leather cover for it that was only about $20.00 and it's thin enough that it doesn't add much to the slim size of the iPad at all.  I also bought a screen saver for it.  That screen save was about $12.00 which, I know, is a bit more than most screen savers, but I strongly recommend it.  It was SO EASY to apply.  NO BUBBLES.!###Love it, its super awesome mini ipad, very utility thing i use in every meeting i have, new, good condition!###as expected fly away with speed and color is beautifulrecommendedas usual good products from apple .....usage 1 month ans still happy!###m'y soon he love it, it's fast and esy to used apple ipad mine 32gb wi-fi is good investement happe.!###I got this ipad for my partner who is traveling. It's perfect. Love the 4G option and especially love Facetime - the easiest way to stay in communication from long distance. I have the ipad2 & love it but I'm going to upgrade to the ipad mini myself with the next version for the better camera & smaller size.!###Arrived quickly. Price was great for 32G. Bought this for my son's college graduation-he hasn't put it down yet! Does everything he wants without having to drag out his big laptop! Wonderful purchase!!###I love my iPad mini!  It is great for games and music.  I use it all the time.  The browser is good.  Unfortunately there are some things I still have to use the laptop for.  But, I love my mini!!###This is an execelent apple product, I think it's the perfect size, you can take it anywhere. It met my expectation!###This is my first iPad product and I love it. It charges quickly and has a nice small charging port. It was easy to set up and get going.!###So after waiting for 2 weeks and thinking should I or shouldn't I, I went ahead and got it. 32 gig black. I am a owner or 1st gig ipad 32 gig. But wanted something more up to date, lighter and smaller. So I went to best buy and got it. I must say I am so happy that I did. I really enjoy this thing.  Before I got my mini I went and got a nexus 7. I returned it after 3 days wasn't completely satisfied, I am glad I did. Apps, build quality and feel of the ipad mini is just so much better. I have to say I haven't been able to put it down since I got it. I have given my 5 year old son my 1st gen ipad and told him to keep his hands off my mini. Lol. So if your stuck with the should I or shouldn't I get the mini, take my advice , you should and you will not regrete it.!###Finally an iPad mini. WOW! Not too big, not too small. Much more functional and portable than the standard 11" screen iPads. Screen is clear and crisp. Movies look great. Very light weight. Beats every other 7" category pad hands down. I ordered both this iPad-Mini and the kindle fire HD, and realized the iPad was far superior. Plus you can load all your previous iTunes purchases, including movies, to the iPad mini. If you use iTunes and have purchases thru iTunes, the kindle WILL NOT allow sharing of any of all those iTunes media files. Only the iPad will. Battery last an amazing long time. Much longer than the old 11" iPad's. Probably because it is smaller and uses less energy? Uses the newer apple plug. Same connector as the iPhone 5. Charges with the same smaller apple usb-cube power wall charger. Comes with the same power cube as the iPhones come with. No special high powered cube, as does the larger 11" iPads require and came with. What a treat to use. I sold my iPad 3 for the same price as this mini costs, so I broke even. Plus, the old iPad 3 included ATT cell service. This iPad was the only wifi version. What to do? Get the ATT hotspot, nearly free and same monthly fee, and use this mini with the hotspot. Plus, hotspot allows multiple wifi devices to tap into the wifi hotspot, where as the built-in cell service on the iPad-3 only supplied cell service to that one device, your iPad -3.Save a lot by getting the iPad-mini wifi version, PLUS a hotspot. Best of all worlds. Much more functionality. Same fees.Don't let only one device hog your cell service, share it with a hotspot to all your iDevices (as well as all your non-apple wifi devices).PS. If you want your iPad mini NOW, this price is not that bad.And it was in stock.And shipping with prime was excellent.Just compare what other non-apple supply sources/stores are asking, like HSN or ShopNBC. Now THAT was highway robbery.Figure in NO TAX, availability, prime shipping, and there you are! IPad-mini in hand without the nightmare of entering the horrifying local Apple Store. EEEEK! TAX! Crowds! Zombies! EEEEK!!###we like ours better than our iPad two....screen resolution isn't as great as the kindle fire HD ( which is beautiful by the way)but this little mini packs a HUGE punch!  Will probably sell or give away the larger ipad two we've had since that one came out...this ones extra screen size over other 7 inch tablets gives it a little edge...but if you are merely looking for a small tablet for movie/tv show viewing you could save $$ by getting a kindle fire HD...screen resolution is so much sharper.....But if you have to have this slice of the apple pie (and you have other apple devices and iTunes etc) This is an Ideal tablet...check out the Zugadget cases here on Amazon..they are Beautiful.....great quality...and much cheaper than what Apple has out!!!###I want everyone to know that MOST LIKELY you are purchasing a slightly used iPad. It is pretty much practically new (though I only can speak for myself, others may have gotten iPads in worse conditions). I don't see any damages on mine and it works fine. If you want a brand spanking new and NOT PREVIOUSLY OWNED then don't buy from sellers on amazon. The iPad I have was bought roughly three months ago and my guess is the previous owner did not want it and sold it to one of these sellers you see here. I don't think these sellers can guarantee that the iPad is fully functional with nothing wrong with it but that it looks new and wasn't used for very long. I still have 9 months left on the warranty and the technical support is almost up in a few days this month. I don't know how iPads are packaged but it seemed to be packaged nicely though I can tell it was not brand spanking new from the box. The serial number and more stuff on the back looked smudged and the box was slightly bent at the corners. At first I attributed that to the shipping but it wouldn't look like that through shipping alone. I just want everyone to know what they're buying. If you can afford to buy it here then I suggest you go to apple and purchase a new one even with the tax. It's worth it I promise you. If you don't mind buying a previously owned iPad mini that is like new then by all means. I bought from iPadShop btw and it was fulfilled by amazon not that really means anything it just ships from an amazon fulfillment center instead of directly from the seller and I doubt they really check what they're getting but it just gave me peace of mind that if I did end up getting a lousy iPad atleast I felt that amazon would be held accountable for it. :) Anyway good luck shoppers and savers. &lt;3!###The iPad mini is an excellent little tablet. I use it every day and it works flawlessly.Pros:-Battery life is very, very satisfying. 9-10 hours as promised.-Light and compact. I can hold it for long periods without getting fatigued.-It just works. Apps work as advertised. Everything operates smoothly. Some juts or pauses every so often but nothing to get you frustrated (unlike my Galaxy Nexus).-Brightness. The screen can really pump out a bright image in direct sunlight or as a flashlight in the dark.-Premium feel. I almost always keep a case on it, but when I take it off I can really appreciate just how lavish the metallic finish and sturdy build feel in my hands. It really is a premium tablet that you wanna show off, as opposed to the new galaxy tabs that look like giant plastic phones.-Perfect size for media consumption. I read the news and watch videos daily, surf tumblr, Facebook, etc. The size just feels right for all of it.-Fantastic speakers. The bass won't "boom", but sound is clear and VERY loud for the size of the tablet. Easily fill a small room with ambience.Cons:-Screen resolution. It's alright with iOS 6. But I have the iOS 7 beta, which everyone gets in fall. The font is much slimmer and therefore looks VERY pixelated and jagged. They may change it before the official release but I doubt it as it's a huge part of the system overhaul. I'm still waiting for the retina mini.-iPhone-only apps that aren't specifically made for iPad look like crap. They don't show them in retina resolution, but pre-iPhone 4 QVGA blown up. It looks terrible. The only workaround I found is jailbreaking and downloading Retinapad, which forces the apps into retina resolution. They look great after doubling the pixels.-The usual apple limitations. No direct music download, no SD slot, limited customization. Here aren't really downfalls of the mini, just apple's devices as a whole.Overall I love my iPad. Like I said, I have the iOS 7 beta and I know everyone will love this little tab even more when that rolls out. Better notification drawer, intuitive multitasking (no more little X's to repeatedly tap!), quick controls, it's all boss. I highly recommend it. The only thing I'd love more is a retina version, supposedly coming this fall. If you can wait 3 months, I'd hold off for that. Otherwise, dive into the addiction like the rest of us. Viva La iPad!!###I loved my iPad Mini as soon as I got it for XMas and I had to purchase one for my husband. Now we are both avid users of the iPad mini!!###Excelent. I'm completely falling in love with it. Apple fan without excuse. Light, thinner, beautifull. Now i have to enjoy it 100% :)!###it is the product that i have been searching for im really glad for the ipad mini recommended no words to explain how much love my new ipad mini from Apple!###like the ipad because I can play my games without sitting in front of computer I can sit in my favorite chair!###This mini its just as Ipad 2 or 3, great and big screen, and with a great price. I bought it for my mom and she was thrilled. I Recommend it widely.!###Thank you very much for this ite, (Apple IPad Mini). This product is excellent and useful, and I highly recommend this seller. Thanks a lot.!###I waited a long time to buy a tablet, and after much research I chose the IPad mini Wifi only. I use it everyday and it works great.!###Got it a month ago and yesterday the infamous apple flashing logo, tried several times to restore but just 2001 error appeared, tomorrow I'm going to change it for a new one, will had to wait for 10 day aprox. because I'm in Bogota.!###**Disclaimer: I WON my iPad Mini but I paid for the $100 memory upgrade ***Having said that, I've paid thousands of dollars for my Mac products over the years. I was on the verge of splurging on this one too. So the review makes no difference.A solid 5 star. I went from 1st generation big heavy iPad to this. And I AM LOVING IT.The weight: Heavier than a Kindle but only slightly so. It's perfect to throw in your purse, to read books, to do email and to watch movies and videos.Screen: Quality of the screen, the colors, the text, it's high tech, top notch and even over the top gorgeous.Battery life: So far so good. I've had it for weeks, charged only once, been using it 2-3 hours a day some days a lot less.... it varies.For reading books, it's great but I tend to read PDF documents here and still read my major books on the Kindle but of course you can switch on your Kindle app and keep reading on the iPad.Love the size and weight the most. So glad to own this little puppy. >SPLURGE. You live once, you deserve it and no, Apple doesn't pay me a dime to say that but they really should ;)!PS: The only thing that bugs me is the cable connector. Did Apple really have to change the connector type? Are they really that much of a jerk to screw up a perfectly good system and create so much waste from unusable cables .... for what??? Idiots! The things we must put up with to have our Apple products.I am an Apple product fan, not an Apple company fan, as you can see!!###iPad Mini Review from a non apple fanboy, As the title says! I've used Apple and Android cell phones, tablets, windows and apple Computers and (Linux). I'm very pleased with my purchase of the iPad Mini, It's everything I wanted and nothing I didn't. It's cheaper then the full sized one, it's smaller, it's easy to hold, theres tons of apps like with all iOS Devices, The battery lasts a good amount of time, the screen is very bright, the speakers are well built in ones but at that there very good, I'd recommend buying the Apple smart cover it makes that iPad you bought that much better, I've had it since day one and it's an amazing combo. I'm able to protect it, keep it apple clean and stylish, and it folds into a stand, and it unlocks it and locks it when closed and open. I'm Very happy, also I know it doesn't have a retina display but the picture is still very good, I'm comparing this to the my Previous Kindle fire, I know I know this going to be harsh but the kindle feels like a kids tablet but I guess you get what you pay for I got my kindle fire in 2012 mothers day special for 139.99$ that being said it's quite a bit more for the iPad, i'd rather work more and buy the iPad Mini that's how big of a difference I feel there is.A++I have to say I bought my iPad mini 16GB black from an Third Party eBay seller, because amazons price was higher and that's the only shame in this that amazon almost wants you to buy there tablet and keeps the apple jacked up maybe that isn't the case, but how it looks.!###got it for my son and he uses it like 8 hrs a day. its awesome and easy to use.!###Looking for a new Ipad with plenty of storage and found it here.  Was worried about purchasing electronics on the Web but the price was right.  Took a shot and glad I did, the unit was exactly as described, still had a warranty and looks/runs great!!###Siri has a comeback for everything...and I mean everything, listening to my brother talk to her and her give him attitude back was the highlight of my day!  I am going to order my own Ipad Mini, my bro says its awesome!!###I love my mini iPad.  Cost was more at amazon than I saw at a couple other places, but ordering was easy and came promptly, packaged well.  I love the size and functionality of the mini iPad.  I did trade a kindle for the iPad because I wanted the camera, front and rear facing camera.  I also wanted ability to do FaceTime.  I'm extremely happy with my purchase and would recommend it over any other.!###Excelente :) muy buen producto lo recomiendo &#128570; excelente transasccion ,rapida,  Y SEGURA &#128515; LLEGO ANTED DE LO ACORDADO :)!###01/09/13I love the Ipad mini so far. I purchased the Belkin @TV to stream live TV or recorded shows from mmy DVR in NJ to my tablet in MD. It works pefect. The processor of the Ipad mini and the wireless capabilities can handle streaming live video over 2 seperate wifi connections perfectly. Hotel wifi isn't generaly the strongest either. The selection of apps are great of the Ipad. The interface is very responsive as well. I purchased the Khomo keyboard case for the mini, and I am able to type with a physical keyboard and interface with the Ipad min without a problem. It has worked flawlessly for me thus far. I am able to check email and surf the web with ease. The screen is the perfect size and the tablet is lightweight an portable to use anywhere. I highly recommend this product.Feel free to ask any questions.01/07/13I purchased the Ipad Mini for $352.03 @ Apple with Tax and Free Shipping. The inner components of the Ipad Mini are comparable to that of the Ipad 2, A5 processor, 512MB RAM. I purchased this because the traditional Ipads are too bulky, large, and heavy. This one weighs ounces even in a case and works perfect. The screen is large enough to surf the web, write texts and emails, type in word processor, etc. There is an app called CloudOn that allowed me to access my files remotely and edit them with a word software. The Ipad Mini maintains the full functionality of any other Ipad and can download an run any application the Ipad runs. It is convenient that it has the same application base built with reliable apps.The machine runs smooth. It hasn't really glitched or froze on me in the month I have had it so far. It runs video very smoothly, and is very responsive. It connects to the internet with no problems over a wi-fi connection. I will test out the processor by seeing how well it works with the Belkin @TV. It streams video from my home wi-fi remotely to wherever I am. Once I do that, I will further update my review.!###I originally started considering a larger reading tablet since I've been doing all my reading on my iphone kindle app.  I wanted a larger screen, but something easily portable.  I also get most of my recipes online/pinterest and off the internet so I wanted something small that I could transport easily through the house to the kitchen, rather than lugging my laptop from room  to room.  I did some homework by reading reviews on the biggest selling mini tablets:  Kindle Fire HD, Nexxus 7 inch tablet, Ipad Mini, and the Nook.  It came down to two...the Kindle Fire and Ipad Mini.  Since the Fire got great reviews by almost everyone, and was 130. cheaper for apparently better visuals and sound, I ordered the Fire so that I could have it in time for our holiday travels.  I loved the Fire's display and sound, but as I was watching an Amazon video, I noticed how heavy and thick it was, and was annoyed by the fact that it had almost a one inch margin around the edges of the screen (reducing the screen display area).  I read that was because of the speaker hardware inside the tablet.  The Android system also annoyed me.  It's just not as straight forward as the i0S system. I decided to go to Best Buy to get a hands on view of each device (so should have done that to begin with)  I immediately fell in love with the Mini Ipad's looks and feel and visuals looked great to me.  I figured the sound would be ok since it was an Apple Product and I didn't want a sound machine anyway.  I regretted buying the Fire and decided to return it and order the Ipad.  I have absolutely no regrets.  I can have the Kindle App and access to Amazon, I can get the Amazon streaming videos with Prime (not a big deal since their video selection is lame) And all of the Apple apps I have grown used to with my iphone.  What I like best:-The Mini is much lighter and delightfully thin.  I can hold it forever without noticing the weight.-Unless I did a side by side comparison on display and sound, I notice no real difference.-7.9 size is perfect.  The Fire is smaller and narrower in comparison and when I read I want as much width as I can get without being bulky.  Also, the screen goes out almost to the edges of the tablet with slightly larger margins on top and bottom, which just makes more sense and makes a big difference in how much display you get to see at one time without having to enlarge.-More straight forward and user friendly in my opinion than Android system.-Sound is just right for most things.  Not a sound machine, but still sounds great and will play a tune without tinny sound and videos are loud enough for anyone except maybe those with significant hearing loss.  My son made a comment on the fact that the sound is surprisingly good for a small tablet.  I read that the sound is an improvement over older Ipads anyway...stereo sound.-Extemely portable.-Since I got it, I haven't used my laptop and probably won't unless I need to do alot of internet surfing or typing.-The Fire in comparison is thick, bulky, heavy with smaller screen size.-I just love it.  If I'm going to spend more money on a small tablet I want to be completely happy with the product and I am.  It's worth the extra 130.00.  I don't know why Amazon sells it for over 400. I got it through Apple at 329.00.-The size is perfect and just what I wanted in a mini tablet.  Not too narrow.What I don't like or wish was better:-It wouldn't hurt to be comparable to the Fire in sound quality or display but really I don't care at this point. Its good. If a better version comes out next year I think I'll still be content with this item.-Its so thin and smooth you will want a case to keep it from slipping off of things.*Also the battery life is impressive.  Reviews speculated approx 10 hours of usage.  On my first charge I got over 15 hours of usage (which included a lot of internet surfing and video watching) and on my second charge I already have over 5 hours of usage and 62% battery charge left.  This will help me conserve battery charge on my iphone.  Oh! What i joy it is to read on this rather than on my iphone what took me so long!!###I purchased my mini as soon as it was available from Apple and my wife took over our 2nd gen iPad with cell. I Chose the wifi only model figuring I would tether to my iPhone when I wanted to use the web away from a wifi connection.As soon as I turned on the mini I was sold.1. Much easier to hold. A good portable device between the small iPhone 5 and the full size iPad.2. The display is better than the 2nd gen iPad thanks to the smaller screen, yet easy to read and good detail for apps ment for the iPads. Note that there is a magnifying capability for iPhone apps that gives a small display full screen display.3. Typing is easy as the keys are spaced apart and large enought for touch typing.4. Believe it or not the mini fits easly into to the side pocket of my vest when housed in a Roocase filo cover. Try to do that with the larger tablets.I spent several hours at Apple's AppStore building a library of iPad apps, most which we're free.  I also purchased apps for using Excel, Word, PDFs and found these worked very well when converting files I placed in iCloud. Reading the converted documents is easy as the print on the mini is large and clear enough not to cause eye strain.A couple of disappointments:1. Teathering to the iPhone 5 is simple, but I found that I use the mini more and more now for web search, texting , etc. and the iPhone 5 primarily for phone calls. A result is i now know that I should have purchased the mini with the cell option. Not a fault of the mini.2. Without the cell networking option, apps that use your location do not work, even when connected to wifi or teathered to the iPhone. This was a disappointment as mini will make a great GPS screen when driving. It also means that apps  that "find" your device won' t work either - I should have thought of this.3. Third party accessories are slow coming to the market. If the accessory uses the lighting connector it probably won't be seen until early 2013. I have also found that cases with keypads are slow coming on the market. The top brand protective cases such as Zagg and Clamcase have yet to release their promised cases.Would like to see: A mini with cell phone connectivity, i. e. a smart phone option. Why some of the smart phone manufacturers have not offered this would be an interesting article.Recomendation: My Windows PC has not been started since the mini arrived. After a month of using the mini without the cell network option, I have ordered one with cell networking. When I get it will probably write a review and if the cell networking works like the larger iPad it will get five stars.Sandbox 2!###My first Ipad purchased was a black 32 mg mini.  I bought it at the Apple store because it cost much less than here and my name was engraved free.  I really like this mini. I can put it in my handbag and take it with me without needing a big bag to put it in.  I purchased the leather case sold on amazon to go with it as the magnetic case from apple is not much good.  Pretty useless actually.I am glad I waited on this mini as downloads and playing games going to FB or wherever is so easy.  I gave this a five because I really like this product.Update:OK, so I dropped it on the floor.  I go to apple care and they say it is under warranty but I really didn't buy that at all. And I was right.  Here are the steps for repair.  You try and navigate the apple care site, get a repair id, take the ipad to UPS Store and they wrap it and send it overnight to Apple.  Apple gets it and says, oh it is damaged with a cracked screen and you must pay $241.77 for us to repair.  I say ok.  I go online and pay the $241.77 to repair the glass.  They send another email a couple days later and say we didn't hear from you so we shipped it back unrepaired.  I call apple care.  They say, we see the emails and the payment we don't know what happened but let me connect you to a supervisor who can suggest a couple things.  After being on the phone 20 minutes with them they have the dude call me back and he says, I don't think I can intercept the ipad but if you will send it back we will repair it.  I said look, I already had to drive 10 miles to a UPS store and paid $241.77 only to be told it was returned unrepaired. There was no solution offered to me only that I could call this manager back.  I said for what.  You had your chance and I am disgruntled with apple and expected a whole lot more from Apple.  The moral to this story is forget their repair center.  IT STINKS!  I understand my town has a company that repairs for the same amount with a two hour wait.  That would have been a lot easier.!###The reasons I used to choose the iPad mini. I put my specific needs above buying the biggest and the brightest. The following are what I thought was important for me, it may not be for you.As much as I wanted the retina display, the larger sized iPad was simply too big for me to regularly take outside the house - I made that mistake with buying a too big, too heavy laptop once. But the mini, at 7inches, is big enough to watch movies, read books and magazines on my couch and bed with ease. Those who think a smartphone or ipod does the same thing, are mistaken, even at 7inch, a tablet makes the world of difference - I typed this review on my iPad, I would still be typing if I had used my phone.  If you have never experienced the quality of the retina display, you probably will not miss it here. The thing is solidly build as you would expect from an apple product; the speakers do pack a punch, you can literally feel the air coming out.As for choosing apple over android or windows 8. The need for the use of flash (a deal-breaker for me when the first iPad came out) has lessened substantially, as HTML 5 is now the go to standard for web pages.  Even though I'm a PC user,  I am familiar with apps via my iPod touch. The amount and more importantly, the quality of apps in the apple eco system are far superior to the ones on android. although the novelty has somewhat worn off on the appeal of my impulse buying of apps, it's still a major reason for buying a tablet. Take for example - my optimum cable iOS app, it is so far superior to its android cousin, it's hard to believe that it was written for the same product. Based on my experiences with dubious apps in the (for better or worse) largely unsupervised google play store, via my Samsung Galaxy, there is an advantage to being part of the paternal Apple market. Although, I expect this to change dramatically, the next couple of years, Windows isn't even on the same planet, in terms of app selection.  If you need to multitask, are price conscious, or simply despise Apple, the Android based kindle fire HD or nexus, with their better screen quality, may be for you.I bought the 16 gig version, using the extra $$ to buy 4G capability instead, to take advantage of the growing options of cloud computing when I travel. If you have kids and travel a lot with and without them, or for business, you should seriously consider the 4G option, as ubiquitous, free, reliable Wifi, like flying cars, has yet to be a reality. If you get the wifi only version, don't have an iPod, but still can't live without your stored media, you probably should consider 32 gigs minimum, especially if you don't get the 4G. The other issue of Verizon CDMA vs AT&T's GSM network, is a whole other story. One slight peeve. The "lighting fast" connector looks nicer than the older one but it's clearly a money making device (apple could have finally accepted the virtually USB standard but why give your loyal customers the option of using a ubiquitous $10.00 cable, when you can charge triple times that, if you need a replacement) Mine still does not charge my iPad, when connected to my "older" (30 month old computer,) I  have to do so from a wall outlet.Long story short, I've had mine for a few days, with no regrets. Yes, the retina display will be tempting but is not worth waiting months for on the mini. Life is short. You can always trade up next year.!###I have to say after having the iPad and iPad 2, I was hesitant to move up to the 3rd gen iPad, especially since I was happy with my iPad 2. I had heard about the iPad mini and decided to go to a store to look at one. After picking it up for the first time, I was sold. It is incredibly light! It just felt so much less bulky than any other iPad I'd had and bonus for the first time ever I can just slip it in my purse instead of having to have a bigger messenger bag on days when I wanted to take my iPad out with me.As for versus the high resolution displays, to be honest I have an anti-glare screen protector on all of my iPad so at the end of the day it makes no difference. I can watch a movie or read a book or send and email quite comfortably. To me this is what I never knew I always wanted in my iPad, and I do just love it.As for the price, I do think it should have been price 10% lower to give it the solid under $300 mark on the 16GB. For me though I like iOS, I've tried android and it just wasn't for me. Android devices in many cases are also quality but at the end of the day I always say try both and figure out what you like best. For me, it's iOS, it's simple and direct so for my first 7&#34; tablet I decide to splurge and it was work it.!###It opened apps that we did not select and would randomly start typing when no one was using the device.Very disappointing. Sent this back over 10 days ago and I am still waiting to hear how this will be resolved,!###Always uses my computer often for many things.  Have found it so much easier to use I-Pad and carry it with me.!###Amazing! I was scared to order this type of product from an online source,  but I was  Not disappointed.  It was in perfect condition and I was incredibly pleased!!###It more that I expect.  Its a great help for my ebooks and for work out of the office or play in travels.!###I had an iPad 2 for work, but I had to return it when I went on maternity leave, so I thought the iPad Mini would be a good substitute. It's great - an excellent size and weight. I don't miss the larger iPad at all! I truly enjoy using it.!###She loves it. Also got her a Logitech keyboard. She loves it. It was the best present that I could give her.!###Like the Mini iPad, a little hard to figure out but has great potential.  Am taking a class at Apple to learn everything!###I use this product exclusively for Foreflight in a Cessna 182.  It is a very convenient size for flying and the battery lasts a long time.!###Just love it. I just bought the mini and I have no complaints I think it is awesome. I recommend it to everyone.!###My first Apple product. I will be using it principally for use in the field for observation of birds. It allows me to carry electronic guide books with a great weight saving, make lists and notes of observations and play songs and calls. It will take a little time to adjust to the Apple interface after PCs, but so far it seems very practical and intuitive. I will also use it for book-reading and I am very pleased to find it so comfortable for reading.I would have liked to know that a couple of apps only work properly after synching to iTunes, but I figured it out eventually!!###Amazing and usefullInteractiveEntertainer, multifunctional and helpfullThis is a great way to keep you closer of the digital worldwide!###I like this particularly as a new elderly  user.  The larger ones were not easy to carry around in my purse.!###I had an ipad and LOVED IT.  I dropped it on a concrete floor and shattered the glass screen.  I figured I would get a replacement, and hey - the ipad mini - just the same but  adorably lovably small, right?  well I have to confess that although I don't feel like i'm 50 my eyes sure have decided they are and everything is just enough smaller that its harder to read.  I miss my full sized ipad.!###Good, stable system and fast, but really closed to advanced users. Using iTunes for upload files is very annoying. iOS is perfect for beginners, because the system is stable and they will be unable to install damaging softwares.!###Love it! Easy to carry around, Good Battry life, use it on the bus, in between class and at work.!###I took a year to decide whether or not to buy a mini or regular sized ipad.  I love that it is small and can fit into my purse.  The 32 GB has plenty of storage space on it and is great!  Would DEFINITELY recommend purchasing this!!###My first iPad and I love it! It's brand new, packaging and system wise. You could check if it's used by its serial number on the Apple site. I was skeptical at first reading all the reviews but I took a chance and ordered it off here. Saved me money and the delivery was beyond fast. I only waited 4 days with free standard shipping. Everything works like a charm! Really happy about this purchase!!###Just as described- New and works great.  I might get another one.  I got it as a gift for a family member.!###Fits great in my purse.  Easy to read screen.  Holds a charge really well.  Sleeps and comes back to life quickly.!###Great all it is working !

Sealed tight.Surprised to discover I could talk to this tablet and get answers.Extremely pleased!!###I have really liked the Ipad Mini. It is a great product and well worth the money. Some of the things I have really liked are: It has lock and unlock features; It is very user friendly; It's also small, and very portable. I really love how easy it is to use internet, and access my email, and how you can text on it. The camera takes fairly good quality pictures. They are not as good as an actual camera could take, but the pictures are not blurry or grainy. Something that has really come in handy is the notes app. It is really nice to be able to make lists on it, or write down reminders. It is sensitive to touch, and there is lots of storage space.The battery life is great, lasting up to 3 or more hours. Other things you might be interested in are,CalendarThousands of free appsHas a simple set upCan search your apps I prefer the Ipad Mini to the Ipad, because the Ipad Mini is smaller and easier to use. The Ipad mini is black, with the apple sign on the back. The home screen either has your apps in rows or groups of apps. You get to choose your background. My only complaints about this product, are that the screen is easy to break; and that it takes a long time to charge. Because it takes so long to charge, I try not to use it as much.When i use my Ipad mini, is when I need to go somewhere and do some work on it, at home, or just to pass the time.!###This is the perfect tablet for our toddler. We are able to download learning APPs for her and its SO easy to use. Love the front facing camera option. Works like a gem.!###I purchased this for my 8 year old Grandson's birthday.

A sharp display coupled with a compact and portable design make the iPad Mini a very useful device.!###I love this thing!  Its small and compact and easy for me to hold in my baby hands.  It shows everything just like an iPad would but on a small scale which I love.  Its easier to read books on, and the book feels more like a hardcopy book than a Kindle.  Its fun to play games on, watch movies on, and most importantly makes my flights seem a whole lot shorter!!###I'll admit to being an Apple hater. My wife has had an iPhone and an iPad and loved them, and I've used Mac products for work, however, I'm an Android fan all the way. When it came time to get my own tablet, it was nearly a forgone conclusion that I would be getting a Samsung Galaxy Tab or something like it. However, when I went to Best Buy (who has to realize they are the show room for people to play with stuff before they buy here on Amazon, right?) to handle small tablets, I was not very impressed with the Samsung. It was nice and all, but came away feeling like it was an oversized phone. I reluctantly looked at the iPad Mini since it was the same price and came away impressed. It truly is the best small tablet out there. I took away one star because there are a few things I still prefer in the Android system to iOS, but really, if you want a small tablet, for now, get the iPad Mini.!###It sounds crazy, but my wife and I bought our 18 month old daughter a Nabi for Christmas and she hated it. She always waswanting to play with mommy's ipad instead. So we finally broke down and bought our daughter this ipad along with a shieldprotector in case she drops it and she couldn't be any happier. Way worth the money to make a little girl happy. Thank youAmazon and to the wonderful people who sold me this.!###I love the Ipad Mini for Navigation and weather reporting while I'm flying.You need to get one with AT&T or Verizon data so it will update.!###we have both the iPad and the iPad mini and have given the new mini with retina display. For ease of travel, especially, when needing to go light, the iPad mini is tops. For reading it depends on the individual. In int'l travel where light in rooms may be lacking these work well. We do not recommend the new retina display as its effectiveness doesn't seem to offer much for the small screen.!###I have a Kindle 8.9&#34; HD and it is slow as compared to this iPad. I like to watch videos from past shows on PBS such as the Woodright shop and nature shows. My kindle just sat there doing nothing and waiting, and waiting ......, but the iPad works great. My wife has one as well and  we bought hers at Sam's and it was more expensive.!###Works will and was what I expceted. Bought it for a X mass gift for wife. Bouns points for me!!!!###Love it- only complaint is I should have purchased one with more storage than the 16.  But that's my fault.  Love the size, features, ...everything .  Would highly recommend purchasing.  Then would also suggest really studying up on its capabilities, because there's a lot more to this little tablet than meets the eye.  Great product- worth the extra money to purchase an apple!!###I already have an ipad myself so i know this would be a good product but the size of this one is great for my daughter to bring along and fits nicely in my purse. Great for traveling. Parental controls make it great for any age.!###This is the best product. I love how small and lightweight it is. It came quickly. Couldn't ask for a better birthday present to myself!!###Ordered this as a give away item for convention and it was perfect. This was a must have on all Christmas lists.!###Though it was refurbished, it has been working perfectly. I use it a lot for my job, and I love it. The size is way more functional than the bigger ones.!###It's perfect size makes it the perfect tablet for me and the uses I do with it, which is mainly internet surfing. Love it so much I might invest in another one soon lol!###My husband and I are young parents, so we get out and about quite a lot on trips. We take lengthy road trips roughly once a month for fun (more frequently when the weather is nice). And we like to do take these lengthy trips with our three year old, whose patience for the third drive to Canada in one year is...not super good.Enter: iPad Mini, ultimate toddler entertainment device.My son started off as a wee little pudgeball using my iPad 2, and I noticed that he and the iPad had an unnatural connection. The predicable nature of iOS and sensitive touchscreen were easy for his baby brain to puzzle out with trial and error, and the many restriction options allowed me to lock him out of most things he shouldn't get into. He was better at using the thing than I was within weeks, and when that iPad met an untimely death on a concrete floor, we decided to get our son one of his own. The iPad Mini is a much smaller, sleeker device that fits chubbular fists quite easily - a perfect size for children.Armed with a suite of educational apps and Curious George episodes, our son and the iPad have now driven thousands of miles and visited several countries. The battery life lasts us most of a day without being plugged in (and that's with constant video playback). It has quieted innumerable tantrums while on the road in the middle of the Cascades and on the most hideously boring stretch of road known as I5 in southern California. I expect it will also survive our upcoming six hour flight quite nicely.On a less child-oriented level, the screen looks great and the slender device is a pleasure to behold. The white one looks a bit cheaper than the black one, in my opinion, but that's all rather subjective. The software is fast and responsive. The touchscreen is a delight.Note for parents who might want to grab one of these for their children: iOS7 now defaults to showing ALL videos you've ever bought in the video library, including those you haven't downloaded. You can turn this option off in the settings. If you don't want a frustrated child without WiFi trying to download your copy of Dredd 3D, you should really make sure to do that. :) Also, make sure to set the &#34;require password&#34; setting from &#34;15 minutes&#34; to &#34;immediately&#34; so that you don't end up buying a few extra seasons of Curious George. And make sure to turn off in-app purchases, too.Last thoughts: I wish the restrictions were somewhat more comprehensive. You can prevent kiddos from deleting apps, but not from deleting videos, and it's hard to bring Blue's Clues back in the middle of nowhere when he accidentally deletes the whole season. I also wish this tablet were a bit cheaper - it's an awfully expensive device to risk the child throwing it out a window. My son's been surprisingly responsible with his iPad so far, though. Whether the investment is worth it for your family probably depends on the child in question.!###whats not to love about the ipad mini? i have several android tablets and i personally love how simple the ipad is to use and set up i am a video blogger on youtube so i use my ipad to record and upload my videos dont have many apps as i just got it ordered tons of cases and skins for it battery life with full brightness is def an issue when i pulled the lightning charger out for the first time it dropped to 97% is this normal or does my brand new ipad already have a glitch? havent tryed any games yet planning on downloading some soon thats my review for now will update as i use my ipad......!###christmas present for the mrs.she has been waiting this for awhile now,and dont even know that i got her one for christmas!lol!###I bought this product April 2013 for my husbands birthday. He has not had any problems at all with this product. The battery last a long time. It is light weight and easy to use. It arrived very quickly. I love Amazon !!!###this mini i pad is just what i needed for the christmas holiday for my grandson. also the price was just right.!###Love it!  Easy to work with and will not buy anything else after trying a Surface tablet too.  Just ordered another one for my husband.!###Purchased this for my 9 year old for his bday.  We went through 3 android tablets (cheap ones) and I decided to purchase this one and he loves it and I am loving it as well. I am more of android person and now thinking about Ipad Air.!###This is the best tool I ever bought for myself. I carry it everywhere, sometimes even leaving the smart phone behind. Available applications are numerous enough to allow me to do almost anything I take a fancy to do on a computer. I sometimes wonder whether my father, an electronics engineer born when radio was born, would take as much pleasure in this spiffy little 21st century machine as I do.!###I bought this with Christmas money and I am so glad I did, I love it!  Everyone in my family has their own ipad and I didn't think I really wanted one but I really do love it and its so much easier to pick it up to check my email or whatever versus turning on the macbook.  I really like the size of this one, so glad I opted for the mini!!###This Christmas gift came on time for Christmas wrapping, despite being ordered the week before Christmas. My husband loves his Mini. It has done a good job of replacing his dying laptop for watching movies and surfing the internet.!###Buy this.  Don't bother with any of the others - I purchased 2 Kindle models and a Google Nexus before returning and buying the iPad mini.  It's the perfect size to throw in your purse, read, watch movies, shop, etc.  It's integrated with my Mac and iPhone.  I absolutely love it.  No regrets.  Retina display is nice on the more expensive model, but I wasn't comfortable having a $400 device for my kids to destroy.  I bought one for my son and now have since purchased another for my other son and one for myself.  It's perfect.  My boys are also addicted to it!!###Got it for Christmas. Just what I wanted. Great for games, music, and videos. Love the way it fits into a pocket!!###Found way more uses for it than I originally intended.Its one of those once you get it you wonder what you did before you ever had one!###This device works very well and was easy to set up and customize.  Love the size!!I highly recommend it as a reader and versatile tablet.!###I love my iPad mini.  It is better than using my iPhone all of the time to check emails and play games.  Plus a bought a keyboard thsat lets me type,  It fits into most of my pocketbooks for carrying around.!###After years of trying to maneuver and not strain to see on my Droid, I have found the perfect fit for me! Smaller than my laptop and perfect fo fit in my bag and go with me! Best gift ever!!###The iPad is a gift to my wife. The iPad has proven to be a valuable supplemental device for use along with her Macbook Pro. The Kindle app allows the iPad mini to replace the books and magazines that my wife often carries during a trip.!###Everyone should get one.these are not just a toy! iPads are very under used.you can do more than you can on laptop.i love it.i got this one for my wife just so she would leave mine alone, and I got a iPad 2.she was hooked the first time she used one.!###Since I am a big fan of Apple and have owned an iPad since it came out, I like to give it as a gift so that I introduce Apple and the creations of that genius that was Steve Jobs, to people that I really care. Another reason was that since I am visiting the U. S., products here are cheaper, besides the fact that Amazon is a most reliable company. Keep the wonderful job you do!!###A must have for children that live either abroad or in other states!!  FaceTime is great fun and a wonderful way to see each other and share.  The gift was for the whole family and I would recommend it to anyone.  There is nothing disappointing about it other then giving only one to a family of 4 can be cause for fighting with children!!!###Apple has the best tablets and this is another great one. Gave it to my wife for Christmas and she hasn't put it down. It fits the hand and it fits the budget.!###I purchased my new ipad mini wifi silver/white from WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTORS for Xmas. I had some doubts about buy it from amazon but i decided to take that risk. The ipad came in brand new conditions without any issues. Camera, speakers,wifi all this stuff works great. I totally recommend this seller fast shipping and goods reviews. I selected standard shipping but the ipad arrive in 2 days!!! I WAS VERY SURPRISED.!###Have never owned ipad previous and after shopping around, decided it would be difficult to beat another Apple product. Really like this product. Set up and getting started was very easy. the ipad mini can do more that i expected. Features are simply great. I would definitely recommend this product. The price from Amazon was also great.!###I was looking to something to give my husband as a gift, that would help him with his busy work schedule. This was and is the best gift of choice.LP!###I bought this iPad primarily for the ease of use. But I found that the dictation portion of this iPad stinks! You cannot correct the vocabulary, It will repeat the same spelling over and over regardless of how many times you make corrections. Even if you speak slowly you will still get a lot of words incorrect. There's no backspace key&#8230; Only a back delete key. There is a time limit on how long you can actually speak. And the worst part of all you cannot see the words that you're speaking until after the dictation is off.Dictating this review I had to correct at least seven errors.!###Even those I have used this iPad Mini for a short time...I am seeingthe benefits of  getting the information I want along with a very usagesize.!###Amazing!!  Steve Jobs knew what he was doing!  Died too young! Now I want to buy onee for the whole family!!!###Christmas gift that does everything expected of it, and so easy to get started.  If you are already an Apple user, you'll find this product seemless.!###It was a gift for my 9 year old grandaughter.  It arrived timely.  It was in mint condition.  She loves it and won't lay it down.  I was very pleased and it was so much easier than fighting the crowds in the retail stores.!###I bought this as a gift. My lady loved it. I know this probably won't help, but that's all I feel like typing. Have a good day. :-)!###I'm so glad I bought this iPad!!! there were reviews saying that this could be a scam and could be used but it is brand new and works perfectly. Also, I saved  like $30 because I bought it from Amazon.I'm really addicted to my iPad!!###I bought this for my Niece and Nephew as Christmas Gifts.My review will not be based on technical specifications , but real world experience with the device.Pros -- Stylish with very clean look- Made out of Durable Metal Material (Does not feel cheap)- Screen Display is great for its size and model- Great Battery life (Essential for long periods of Candy Crush , or to Keep the Kids Entertained for long trips)- Easy to hold and grasp (Does not feel heavy)- Runs on iOS (very simple to understand and play around with . The kids quickly picked up how to perform functions on their devices with ease)- Supported by the Apple Ecosystem (Tons of apps to download and explore)Cons -This is more of nitpick , but I wished the essential accessories official from Apple were more affordable(Case and Charger cables).Side note: This Device has another feature that is not mentioned. It's more of side effect , but This Device can  potentially help you find dates!Kids carrying these devices around becomes walking advertisements for your awesomeness . My Niece and Nephew kept bragging about how awesome their uncle was to get them iPad Minis. Now I'm booked for dates!!###This was actually a present to myself and I just love it. So far I'm just getting used to it....but I know that I'm going to enjoy it. It has all the benefits of a computer in your hands that you can actually carry around. I would recommend this mini ipad to everyone!!###She has not put this thing down except to sleep since she got it for Christmas.  It was a big hit.  She loves it.!###This was a gift for my wife.  It cost 400.00 at Best Buy.  I save 100.00 and had it sitting on my door step in 2 days.  I love Prime shipping and of course you can't go wrong with iPad mini.  We have large iPad.  This is perfect for her to put in her purse and carry along with her.  SHE LOVES IT... Apple got the size right on this.!###I love my iPad! It's great. I use it several times a day. It's easier to do my email on it instead of on my phone. I even used it the other day to find my iPhone which I had left at a Costco store. Worked like a charm.!###Bought this Apple mini for my son for Christmas...He has a Mac but wanted something more compact to use in class at college. He loves it he says its the perfect size to carry and use.!###I bought it for m  granddaughter and she loves it.  It's exactly what she wanted and needs. It's what she expected.!###I find that I'm not using my full size iPad anymore.  The mini works much better for travel and it works find for around the house. I only wish I had splurged on the 32GB.  I've taken some pictures with my mini and I sync with my Mac so the past 12 months are on my mini.  Photos take about 3GB.  I only have 46 songs loaded. I'd rather keep everything, but I've cleared off apps that I'm not using and everything else that I can clear.  I don't have room for more than 2 rented movies. I'd like to load enough video to keep me entertained for both legs of a 4-hour flight.!###The charging cube that came with the mini did not work at all, and they through the iPad in the snow next to my mailbox!###I love my ipad mini.it is fast and peeforms better than ecpected.I use it more than my laptop now.!###I chose the iPad mini for its convenience. I do not own a lap top, so I had to go to the desk top to go online! I can now search the web and get my mail anywhere there is wifi!!###After having gotten 2 iPad mini retinas, 1 had a pixel issue and the other was pretty flawless, but just incompatible with our Verizon network (sprint mini, useable but unrecognizable device on Verizon). The retina is super speed fast with a nice screen, but am more than perfectly happy with the cellular mini. Having 4g/Lte when I want it is pretty amazing. The speakers on the 1st gen mini are louder and I don't really notice a speed issue. Awesome device and still love it for the portability and the functionality. Screen is the right size for me.!###I bought a mini for my 89 year old mother. She loves it. Very easy for her to handle because of the size.!###Purchased for daughter for Christmas and as expected..PERFECT!! Daughter had been using my Ipad so decided she needed her own and she has not been off of it since she opened for Christmas!!  Another Apple Winner.!###It is a wonderful device but it is not distressing when it does not allow to install free Apps without asking for your credit information.!###Very slim, light and useful device. Great definition and resolution. Portable, friendly and practical to carry on everywhere. Wi Fi provide me access at an entire net and useful info over the world!!!###Love this device for the function and most importantly for the size. Had a 10&#34; tablet before and now I will never go back to that size after having this.!###It works and delivers like any Apple product and that's a very good thing. The best selection of apps ever.!###The size is right and I appreciate all of the apps and choices available with Apple products.Disappointed with the camera and pics taken with this.!###We where not happy with another brand tablet and where unhappy with it, we are very happy with the IPad mini.!###It does not have port for SIM card. Internet and network connection is only via wifi. Other features seem ok.!###This Apple iPad mini MD531LL/A in white appeared on my husband's Wish List, so I purchased it as a Christmas gift, knowing he had already done the research on what he wanted. (The Amazon Wish List is a great tool for choosing the perfect gift!) I'm rating it 5 stars because my husband has expressed delight in its performance. The day after Christmas, he began loading his iPad mini with apps he already owned had on his iPhone. Using the iCloud, he downloaded his iTunes, art, and more. Because we also have Apple TV, the iPad mini's screen can be displayed on our TV screen, so he has been demonstrating to me all its features. I'm especially impressed by its detailed graphics, visual effects, and fast performance. It is thin, light, and easy to use! I recommend it for anyone who wants a tablet.!###this was a Christmas gift for my daughter.... all the accessories works fine with this product ... she loves it.!###Product good as always, Apple makes it easy to setup and get going.No issues and like the white color.  Did not get the retina display, and its fine without it.  No need to spend the extra cash.!###I was skeptic about buying this on Amazon but I decided to go for it. Came before Christmas and it came in brand new sealed in the box. My girlfriend loves it. No issues so far.!###Like all of Apples products, this iPad mini is top notch! It has good performance and is second to none!!###this is a a great, new ipad. my husband is pleased with it. i recommend this to anyone looking for an ipad mini!###Luv this!! Great product I brought another for husband so nice we got iPhones also what can I say we love apple products!###It works extremely week and I am very happy with its performance. It is a good solid product and I am glad I purchased it.!###I ordered this from Amazon for my granddaughter.  It is amazing.  Next one will be for my spouse for his birthday and I know soon after that I will want one all for myself!!###Got this for my sister for Christmas and best believe she loves it! Sometimes I'll play on it since it's so convenient.!###yes, that's right we got this for kindergartner and it was the best purchase we made in a long time. we use it for her spelling words, reading books, movies (on weekends) and she even download apps for her favorite games and magazines like highlights... love this is as a learning too and source of entertainment.!###I had a bought a Kindle fire HD for christmas as a gift, but for some reason we were having problems with it. I replaced it with a Mini iPad, no problems and easier to manage.!###Great product, of course. It IS an Apple product after all. The seller's description was accurate and delivery was swift.Very happy overall.I had to knock off one star because of the confusion I went through trying to determine the generation model of the ipad before I made the purchase. I had wanted a 2nd gen, 32 gig, ipad mini. However, there was NO information as to whether the ipad listed was a first gen or second gen. Other than a brief comment in the questions area indicating that the seller didn't know.Turns out the ipad that was sent to me is a first gen. Not that it matters really. Right now, there isn't much difference between the two generations. But it would have been helpful to have that important bit of info available.Overall tho, it was a positive experience. I'd buy from the seller again happily.!###Quality is 2nd to none. I have the original IPad, iPhone 5, Kindle Fire and truth be known I did not need the mini. The video and photo functions are great.!###I got this iPad for my daughter for Christmas.  She LOVES it.  We play games, email, look things up on Google.!###i own this ipad mini and i love it. it runs smoothly and i have no problems with mine. apps do sometimes run a little more expensive for the ipads rather than on iphone/ipod touches. but i normally stick to the free ones anyway though. i love apple products and in my opinion has the best app store and when there is problems with apps then tend to get updates pretty quickly. they are also very easy to figure out. just be careful if you do drop these with no protection they will shatter! i definitly recommend the ipad mini over any other tablet, the extra money for one is worth it.!###Its good so far, wife really likes it. Bought it for her home business and other things to free her up from having to use the PC at home all the time.!###this is the perfect size for those who want keep your games video and music togueter whit a nice picture!###Brought for mother. She obsolutely loves it. Uses it all the time. She has an iPhone so was easy to use. Just the right size.!###I order this aa a gift for my daughter who really wanted one the price was good and it arrives just as they said I know she is going if love it for sure!!###Apple pretty much sells itself so there's no need for commenting on this. I have always been an Apple fan!!###The iPad was received in it's original package. The iPad itself was not damage and worked perfectly out of the box. Other reviews had me worried about whether it would be used or not.!###I do love my mini. I thought I'd never stop using the Kindle, but now I actually like this better. I can do email on it, but like the computer better for that. Handy to have some games with me at times.!###The seller describe the ipad mini well there's nothing wrong with it however the power cords seems like it's not oringinal including the cord. It is repackage which there was no ipad box for it. Everything works fine so I'm happy.!###Bought this used and it said it was in excellent condition and it was, looked brand new, no scratches flaws and show of wear! Came quickly and got it for a great price!!###Its an Ipad you cant go wrong! The view screen is just right! My 16 year old is going to love it on Christmas!!###The iPad mini arrived in good condition (albeit late, more on that in a minute). It was sealed in plastic showed no signs if tampering. It came with IOS 6, but within hours updated to IOS 7. It was easy to set up and my mom loves her Christmas present. The iPad  itself I would give 5 stars.The shipping via FedEx Smartpost I would give less than a 1 if possible. I have Amazon Prime  and it (plus 2 other items in the shipment) arrived 2 days late. I completely thought it was lost. The tracking data had it in Dallas for 4 days and the post office never saying whether they received it or not.  Amazon had returned my money. Only after Amazon processed my  refund did new tracking data appear, post dated days before. The iPad and other items were presents and I wanted them so I told them to charge me for them again.It was all a big mess due to FedEx Smartpost u was very disappointed with the delivery that did not arrive on time and poor tracking data that made it seem lost.I am  pleased with the iPad, but very disappointed with this shipping method. Amazon needs to stop using it. I have found endless complaints about it.!###Apple's iPad Mini is convenient, reliable, and the perfect size for traveling. Recommended for the techies out there who want Ipad capabilities in a smaller size. .!###Couldn't be more pleased with this purchase! I am a student and having a tablet that I can carry to class in my bookbag vs carrying a laptop around with me is so much more convenient when I already have so many other books and binders with me.  I bought the mini vs the regal sized ipad because of the thinness and the lightweight.  I usually have pretty bad buyers remorse, but not with this item.  Its so easy to hold in one hand and operate.  Would highly recommend for any student or teacher, or anyone on the go.!###Android just doesn't compare. I don't think an iPad needs my review to sell it, we have 2 plus an Android, guess which ones we actually use?!###Arrived on time, works well and has a quite a long battery life once fully charged. My laptop decides to take the day off every once in a while and this little device keeps me from pulling my hair out. Most websites operate the same way that they would on a normal computer and for someone that does not remember to charge her rechargeable electronics, this is great for me because it performs well even when the battery is low. The camera works well which makes the IPad even more convenient because only one device is needed while travelling. The speakers work wonderfully. My music comes out clearly. This is a wonderful device.!###Love this, came quickly, holds a long charge and syncs with all my other Apple products.  I love that it fits in my everyday purses for easy carry and use on the go.  The mini syncs with my iMac and iPhone making my life easy with everything connecting and going from one device to another.!###I already knew I liked the I pad mini, I just ordered one for my daughter for Christmas thinking it might take a few weeks to come in. It came in 2 day!! Very impressed with this company I bought it from and I won't hesitate to order from them again. I opened the box, which was sealed and everything is brand new contrary to what some others have stated on here. Very happy!###I primarily use the iPad Mini for business purposes and I must say that this is the best tablet I have used for just about anything.Without a doubt, iOS 7 is annoying on the Mini or any other iPad but I still find it to be a more useful tablet than the ones running on Android.If you are already an Apple fan then the iPad Mini is a no-brainer if you can deal with a less-than-amazing screen. If you prefer smaller tablets, the Mini is the way to go but if you really need a high-res screen, Apple has just come out with the iPad Mini with Retina, so buy that if you need to.- Seth Fitzgerald, Journalist[...]@SethAFitzgerald!###I bought this device for my wife for school. The device is sleek so for the safety place purchased and otterbox my wife love it.!###It was a used IPad mini, and was connected to someone else's email account. Deal Station gave me suggestions on what to do to clear it, but since I had no idea who the previous owner was, I became very irritated that I couldn't activate the iPad mini. I returned it to Deal Station, and I am now waiting for my full refund.!###This was a gift for our daughter. It was by far the best price around. She loves it! It was shipped so fast.!###I like the iPad mini but the sender didn't send the right charger for it.. So that's why I only picked 4 stars..!###I like it because it is easy to use and has various uses. It was on sale and I used amazon credit I had to aid in the purchase!###I bought this as a gift for someone and they absolutely love it. this was the second one I bought on amazon.!###Bought for my husband. He really didn't want it but he read a book on mine and decided that it was pretty nice. So I got him one and he loves it. He is technically challenged so I am being patient with him.!###We got the iPad mini instead of getting another Kindle. It is not as easy to read from as the Kindle; but the added features (like the use of Facetime and similar apps) were what sold us. I just wish we'd gotten the iPad Air since the screen is a bit small.!###I have been looking to buy an Apple iPad Mini for my wife.  I read reviews.  That said it is not brand new, it has been used, or it came damaged.  I want everyone to know that the product I received was brand new in an Apple Box sealed never open!  Also there is a bar code sticker on the plastic that also says new.  Went to set it up no problems at all.  This was my wife's Valentines Gift.  With two little ones ages 3 /12 and 1 years old.  She has no time to start the laptop log in.  Now she grabs her iPad and does her thing.  Great buy!!###We homeschool our son and wanted to get a tablet that he can play his learning apps and games on, as well as watch videos, read books, etc..Something that will grow with him. I know it seems pricey for a child, but if you think about the cost of video game systems and the additional cost of the games for those systems, tablets are actually a great buy for kids. Most apps are under $5 each, and you get learning value along with the fun factor. Plus you can access the library and borrow books, and so much more.The mini is the perfect size for his small hands (he's 6 but the size of a 9 yr old). It's easy to use and the graphics are really nice. Mind you, I'm not a tech junky...but we have had it for over a month and it gets used a few hours each day and we have never had an issue. The charge lasts for a long time also.I recommend getting the Otterbox for it. Especially if a kid is going to be using it! I found the mini sized Otterbox for about $35 here on Amazon. Our only issue with this tablet is that now I want one too!!###Works great I love it!! Very small and light. I take it everywhere I go!!!! (: Even my husband and kids love it!!###GOOD:It is very good to use by every body even by the small child. It never hang up. It always refresh.!###IS A SPECTACULAR TABLE I CAN TELL WITH EYES CLOSED. I INVITE YOU TO BUY THIS CHART MINI. SPECTACULAR EXCELLENT AND VERY GOOD!###We love our new ipad! It's used on a daily basis and take it almost everywhere with us. Perfect size for traveling. I would recommend any apple product.!###Device arrived as described and in a very quick fashion.  Would recommend for anyone looking for a tablet without needed to rely on wifi hotspots.!###I like the mobility of this sized tablet.  I enjoy Amazon customer service and think it's what customer service should be!!!  I rate it very good if not the best, by phone or over the web, in all aspects I've experienced.!###This Apple ipad mini had given my daughter lots of amusing Apps to work with. The product is great and has little to no flaws in the program. The company that does the shipping was great to work with and I would recommend them to everyone. Will be glad to do more business any time.!###Absolutely love my iPad. The mini is a perfect size and can easily fit in a large purse for bringing to work or when traveling. One of my favorite Apple purchases!###Loading we pages, especially YouTube, is painfully slow sinc the new IOS7. If it hadn't been, so incredibly quick, before the update, I wouldn't  have known the difference.Mine, also has the quirk, of sometimes randomly deleting all notes, on my notepad.  Annoying, so I have learned, to email notes, to myself, to save them.Other, than those two things, it's like having an iPhone, that's twice as large. I love it and will get a new one, in two years.!###Great little device and delivery service was excellent.  Could have waited for the new ipad, but this little machine is great. I like Apple!###As described. I got it 50 usd cheap and still got the ipad winch was almost new. Actually no one could even tell it was not new as the packing and everything was as good as new one!###Brought this item as a gift for my mother on her birthday and she absolutely loves it.  It arrived very early which was a plus!!###I bought this mini iPad remanufactured and it looks brand-new. I don't have any complaints at all so far and have had about three weeks. The battery life impresses me and seems like leaving it turned on, it can last for two days or so before it even gets close to 50%.I like the speed, the way videos look when watching Netflix or Amazon prime, etc. it has not crashed or froze up on me so far.I would definitely recommend buying a case for it, without a doubt. I bought a $20 case and it isn't bad, it just has a hard time staying open and keeping the iPad propped up when watching a movie. So spend a little bit more and get one that definitely keeps it in a position for when you watch movies.!###We own several Apple products, iPhones, iPads to Macmini.  The iPad Mini is more convenient to carry than the iPad and with a much bigger screen than the iPhone.!###The IPad mini arrived in perfect condition sooner than expected!  It looks brand new, fresh out if the box!  A perfect experience!!###We were blown away by this tablet.  It is small yet does so much!!  We use it with an App that allows us to get charts, weather and traffic when we fly our own airplane.  It was compact enough to mount along side our other instruments.  The Apps available are endless and amazing!!  This was a great purchase.!###This IPAD MINI  is same as normal one, it can do everything that a big one can do. it is fast, powerful, easy. I love it..!###I love my iPad Mini - it is exactly what I anticipated.  The retailer who I purchased it from was also top quality.  It shipped right on time and I received it within a matter of days.  I couldn't be happier with both the product and the retailer.!###This review is for the ipad mini 16GB Wi-Fi in blackI bought this ipad mini for a birthday present for my wife, she has one of the original nooks for reading digital books and an ipod G4 and she wanted a device that would eliminate having to use the nook and ipod, the ipad mini is the perfect solution for this! I was torn between getting the mini or the regular size ipad, I chose the mini because its about the same size as her nook, the ipad mini is thinner than the nook which we have now given to our 12 year old daughter for books she is required to read for school, we'll be giving the ipod to a less fortunate family that cannot afford one as my daughter has her own ipod.The Apple app for reading digital books (called ibooks) is actually better than the nook because books can be read in different orientations. ibooks supports PDF format and epub, epub displays the best as it has options to change the font size etc. Any books that come in PDF can be converted to epub (or other formats) for free on numerous converters found online.Game apps load much faster on the ipad and are much more enjoyable to play than on the ipodThe wireless is much better on the ipad than on the ipod as the ipod kept disconnecting and reconnecting from the Internet on our home network, the ipad mini doesn't have this problem.Surfing the Internet is a breeze as well, my wife never used her ipod to surf the Internet, now that she has the ipad mini she surfs the web frequently.It takes great pictures and video which are then uploaded to FB.We'll be taking the ipad mini with us on a cruise and we'll see how it performs once connected to the wireless network on the ship, we'll be using it to check email etc, I'll be updating this review in regard to performance after the cruise.I have never used the standard size ipad so I cannot compare the mini to the standard ipad.!###!###This seller is trusted and highly recommended!!! The product is amazing and the best handy iPad so far!!! Two thumbs up!!!!###I love my iPad Mini because it is so much fun and sleek. I would recommend this product to everyone.!###Apple does it AGAIN! You can buy a Samsung 7&#34; tablet for a lot less and of equal quality. I have an Ipod 5 that does most everything this Mini does. If you need portability, get an Ipod.-5. If you want an Apple tablet, get an Ipad. Apple has the most apps but their competition is quickly drawing up behind them. If you are considering the brand, get other products. If you are considering the price, there are many good competitors for less money. You will have to worry less about the time when Apple will stop supporting its older products in order to force you to buy the newest and latest. I am as loyal to Apple as Apple is loyal to their customers. They make good products with many apps, but are not there for us in the long term.!###I had a poor experience with the initial start up.  When I called the number on the one sheet &#34; user guide &#34;the &#34;support&#34; person was no help,  made me wait for someone who was to know something.  His main interest was in selling me a $165.00 support package.  I didn't buy!!  All I wanted was someone to help me past the opening screen.  I have family help that achieved that.  I love the actual iPad though.  The key board is small for my fat fingers but that is no fault of the iPad.!###Everything works as advertised, but there is one thing that is hidden in the information...You cannot send Pictures or Videos thru the Lightning Plug Cable to 30 pin Adapter using a 30 pin connector cable to RCA Analog into your RCA inputs on your TV. Only Audio will come thru ok, but not Video or Slideshow.The only option Apple has given us, is buy an AV Cable from Lightning to AV or HDMI. the AV unit is for PC or TVs with PC input.What a shame...Will Apple change this???...Jer!###If you're seriously contemplating buying one, let me help you out......DO IT!!!!!! For weeks I kept questioning myself &#34;is it worth it??&#34; I finally gave in and bought one, I just could not resist !! Hahaha :) I love, love, love it! It truly is a great product and easy to figure out ( at least for me it was ).1 complain I do have though, is about the camera. I expected a flash to be on the iPad mini. Also, it doesn't have the clearest picture quality in general. Of course it's not bad quality, just not clear like I had expected.Besides that, it's great, convenient, fast, has fantastic sound, beautiful crystal clear screen and really, really, really fun!!!!!! Defiantly worth the money !!  TRUST ME :}!###Despues de recibir este producto entre en otra era de la inform&aacute;tica, es un giro de 180 grados en tecnologia!###excellent !!!! ................. ............... ...... ............ . . ........... . . . . . . . . . . .!###POSEO UN IPAD QUE USO PARA REALIZAR PRESENTACIONES, A PENAS SUPE Q SE LANZO ESTA VERSION MINI NO DUDE EN COMPRARLO Y ESTOY 100% SATISFECHO CON LA COMPRA, MUY PRACTICA Y COMODA, EN CUANTO AL VENDEDOR MUY RESPONSABLE, ENVIO RAPIDO, GRACIAS!###La atencion y el envio fueron muy rapido de parte del vendedor, Pues el Ipad mini cuando me llego a mis manos estaba genial como deberia de ser, y sin mucho que agregar sabemos que las cosas apple vienen muy bien hecha es una tablet con comodidad y potencia de las grandes, se las recomiendo 100%%!###I do not think the mini replaces the ipad or the macbook but it does have an important place.First and foremost, it is the crowning glory of all apple products as far as an ebook reader. It reads like a trade paperback in its vertical position. I have read plenty of ebooks on my ipad using ibooks but this puts the ipad inthe shade ebook wise.Second, I have always carried my ipad with me in my purse no matter where I am going. I have now changed this to my ipad mini going along in my purse instead. This gives me access to everything at a perfect, portable size.  I do not need to wear reading glasses to use it.  I find the iphone too small to solely carry that around. Although I prefer going online with my ipad, the mini is perfect for this in carrying around mode.Likewise, I play scrabble, gin rummy and do crosswords on he mini now.  I used to solely use the ipad for this. The reduction in size causes no problems and I can again skip glasses. I am almost 65 so this is a factor for anyone in my age group.I also use the mini now for all of my podcasts.  I love NPR, the New Yorker, the NYTimes, etc., podcasts and mini is perfect for all of those.  It is ideal for both audio and visual podcasts. While I still prefer watching films on my ipad due to the larger screen size, the ipad mini is fine for videos where detail is not as important.I am also now loading different apps onto my mini from what I load onto my ipad. Musical audio visual apps such as Jack White's and Brian Eno's just went onto it as well as several art based apps. Increasingly I am devoting my ipads to films and tv.  I no longer own tv sets, finding the apple products all I need for full audio visual.I use keynote and pages of all of these systems.  Probably the ipad is still my favorite size with those programs but the mini performs very well with them.On a daily basis I am still discovering more and more with the mini.  I am sure I have many discoveries yet to make. But even with only this much discovered, I already love it and highly recommend it.I bought mine online at the apple store.  I got it cheaper than this so you may want to check it out there as well as here. I also got two lines of free engraving etched onto the mini's back, my name and email address,  although you can put whatever you want on yours,!###I like this mini iPad,it's great having a large screen Comming from a tiny iPhone screen. I tried the iPad,but it was just too big for me,but the iPad mini is just right.I am Disappointed that Siri won't read whatever I highlight on a web page like my iPhone 4S since my lack of vision keeps me from reading as much as I'd like.The sound quality is just as amazing as the phone,and the keyboard is like a computer keyboard layout rather than the iPhone's keyboard,so for me it takes some getting used to since I'm not familiar with a desktop keyboard.!###Had I pad, gave to wife love the mini, advantage of portability, space and weight reduction versus I-pad.  Strongly recommend!!###I love it!  Perfect size.It is a great product and it was easy to get it started.  Thank you!!###Great product.. but FIX THE RESIZING ON BG PHOTOS!!! The mini is small enough to be portable and large enough to display good work.!###I am in position of an iPad 3th gen and now I got the iPad mini. It took me a while to decide on it whether or not I would even need it but having it for 3 weeks now I did need it. First of all for the money you get a high quality Apple product, which is fully capable to meet with the demands that are expected from it. The nice thing about the size is that it is exactly right for holding it in one hand without being to heavy or the display being to small. I hardly use my old iPad, which already says it all. If you are thinking about buying an iPad and you need a light tablet that is just as good as the big once I would advice buying this one. The batterylife is really good and the display also preforms good in he outside daylight. All and all it's a full Apple worth mini iPad. The only advice I can give for now is wait on the 15th of October because speculations say that on this keynote an new iPad mini will be presented with retina display.!###We like it! I wanted the regular Ipad, but my husband wanted this one. I would much rather have the bigger one! This one is fun though and will get allot of use!!###I am very happy I chose the iPad mini. I replaced my older iPad and am really enjoying the new one.  Amazon detailed most of the information I was looking forward and made my ordering easy.  I would recommend both the iPad mini and ordering from Amazon.!###Love my iPad mini use it every day a lot of time instead of my laptop if you are looking for a tablet buy an iPad.!###Works great. Text is as good as regular iPad. I love that I can share games, appointments and info between &#34;i&#34; devices.Small enough to take anywhere, large enough to easily see.!###Just like new and it works perfect. Bought it used but the condition is superb, it was well kept i love it..!###I bought this primarily to play music videos and had to return it. I have many music videos in my iTunes, but when I synched them to this ipad I discovered that they can only be found by title and only in a thumbnail format (no list format available). I need a tablet with an os that will allow me to find my music videos by artist and then title. This tablet may do many things very well, but it is a miserable failure for any user who has even a minor interest in using it to play music videos.!###returned after much difficulty and over charged and paid for two mailings because he sent it back after I returned it!!!###I have a hard time reading the Mini, screen justto small, enjoy the full size Ipad, should have ordered another full size. Ordered this one thinking that it would be more convenient to use but, but even with the text size at the largest setting its hard to read, other than that it functions just as well as my Ipad  16 gig full size ipad!###Well this ipad mini is nice - clear bright screen, every bit as nice as a full sized ipad.  Except the wi-fi.  I got this to save my back - so I wouldn't have to carry my laptop to work.  But I'm pretty disappointed in the wi-fi.  It has less connection ability than my husband's kindle fire.  The only way I can use it at work, or even in the bedroom at home, is to use my iphone as a mobile hotspot.  It will not and can not connect to my home network or work network - doesn't seem to have the connection range as the kindle fire or my laptop.  If I hadn't already &#34;moved into&#34; it, I'd be returning it.  I am not happy with the very limited connection range.!###This is a nicely designed light, thin, and portable tablet device. I returned mine after a few days of use as there are too many limitations with tablets (especially of this expense) and I'd rather have a laptop or just use my smartphone. Things I enjoyed about the iPad mini: perfect size in my opinion, easy to set up and use, wide availability of apps and accessories, Amazon app available, nice email interface, bluetooth capable, clear high quality display. The things I didn't like about this device:1. Moving files from a computer to the iPad mini has to be done via iTunes, you can't just copy over a folder of music or videos which is do-able just not as easy as on Android based devices2. Price is quite a bit more than other 7" tablets, but the screen is actually 8" and for an Apple product, I'd say a pretty good value3. Keyboard has no tracing or 'swype' like abilities which makes typing cumbersome without a keyboard.4. App store makes you give a password for every single app you download (even the free ones)5. As an e-reader, I'd chose one of the paper-white options over this, but it works fine for reading.6. Its not a laptopThe last reason is my primary justification for returning the device. For a tablet it does what it is suppose to do. But I found myself still preferring to use my small laptop as multitasking is so much easier. I'd say if you really like using apps or playing games or simple web browsing, a tablet is the way to go. I personally found that for me the full computing power of a laptop is worth the extra weight/size, especially given the cost of this device (i.e., you can buy a small laptop for the cost of the iPad mini). However, if you like tablets, you will find this one a good option. And since Amazon app is available now you can save money over the over-priced content of the iTunes store where the same music/videos cost about 20-30% more.!###Okay, first and foremost I'd like to say that I'm not trying to start a flame war here just simply trying to understand why/how the &#34;consumer&#34; would let apple get away with this, and to try to give the Amazon customer the information they rightfully deserve. To be clear I am writing this review on a fourth generation iPad, so I'm not a hater, but I do think Apples prices aren't justified with their hardware.  I am an AT&T rep who has ample time to use the mini and formulate an opinion about it.  Simply put the screen is garbage.  &#34;Every inch an iPad,&#34; is Apples tag line for the device and I must say, no, it's not.  The iPad I'm using has a truly beautiful screen, that only until recently has been able to compete with.  The mini does not.  Now this is what's true about Apple.  They do not care about the end user.  They don't.  Or else ere would be A RETINA DISPLAY ON THE IPAD MINI.  If they can put it Retina on their phone and their full size iPad then seriously. The second generation will have it for sure, by why make their very loyal and sometimes crazy customer base go through with this?  I guess it's because they can.  I would never buy an iPad mini in its current state, and if you have any buying sense you'd wait to.  It's a waste, and will make you feel real bad you purchased one very, very, soon.  Don't succumb.!###I'm really disappointed with some characteristics of Apple products and sometimes I thing resellers don't let you aware of it purposely. This iPad mini model MD531LL/A is NOT RETINA, there is a huge difference between a retina display and this one. At apple store I was able to see that I made a terrible mistake purchasing this model at Amazon thinking Amazon may have a better price by an agreement but it's because the product is old. The newer version of iPad mini cost about $345 at apple store and I paid $315 for the half resolution model. Hum.. Maybe the fault is mine, I agree.!###Would not have purchased the WiFi-only version if the ads and specs had made it clear that even though it does have a GPS, it only works with location-based apps if the WiFi is on.!###Are you thinking about buying a tablet? There are so many tablets to pick from. There are tablets by Apple, Microsoft, Samsung, Nexus, Windows, etc. There are so many different choices, so many different brands. Every single tablet is different. But what tablet is better? How do you know which one to buy? Some like Window products other like Apple products more. Each and every single person is different but there is one iPad that fits all. I believe the iPad Mini is probably the best choice of all, it perfect for everyone. Why should you buy the Apple iPad mini? Well Apple is a very well known company all across the globe. They have created some of the best computers, laptops, created the iPod and the iPhone. Who does not love Apple products? They have the best and most advanced technology. Apple does not let you down, it meets all the expectations, and you will be surprised with what you can do with their products. Mostly everyone has an Apple product these days; personally in my family we own eight Apple products, in which the iPad mini is one. We are very happy with all our Apple products from our laptop and PC to our iPods and iPad. We can say that Apple has not let us down with any of their products we have bought and I know probably many out there agree with us. Why is the iPad mini perfect? First of all the iPad mini is the perfect size, it is not bulky at all. It is only 5.28 inches by 7.87 inches and it is 0.28 inches thick. It can easily be carried in your purse or in you backpack and it won't weigh anything at all. It is also perfect for all college students out there, you can easily take notes with the iPad mini and will never have to worry about forgetting or buying a notebook, so the iPad mini helps you save trees. The iPad mini is also perfect for your children; you can download games, TV shows, or movies. Its perfect for them to use any day, and very perfect for when going on a road trip you can play a movie, give them headphones and make it a peaceful ride where your child wont be bored and start bothering you. The iPad mini is perfect for anyone out there, no matter what it needs to be used for. The iPad mini also has a great camera, which takes very nice pictures. And iPad minis are also starting to be used in schools, which as you can see iPad minis are starting to be used mostly everywhere, why not have one of your own. The iPad mini will make you happier. You can download movies, books, its also can have Wi-Fi. Having an iPad mini will make you very happy, you don't have to carry around bulky books anymore, and you can easily download more then one book on your mini iPad. The iPad mini changes your life, it makes you more modern, and you become more technological. The whole world is becoming more technological, might as well buy an iPad mini and keep up. In conclusion, I believe the iPad mini is the best choice of table. Its produced by a very well known company all around the world. It has the latest technology and it fits all your needs and your families. The iPad mini is very family oriented its perfect for your toddlers to your college students. It perfect for everyday use, for school, and for work. Everyone should have an iPad mini its perfect!###I have the bigger IPad, this is easier to take everywhere, fits in my purse.  It is just a smaller version of theOriginal, with all content the same.  Love it!!###Just perfect. I bought the mini to carry at work and handle some paperwork that is a part of my routine. It exceeds my expectations every time. It just works. Plain and simple. No fighting multiple apps to get an attachment to send, everything is seamless and easy. I can create PowerPoint docs, word, excel, and mark up PDFs. I have little need for our computers at work now because this does it all! Highly recommended.!###Great value for the money and received it quickly. Could not ask for a better price or faster service. ya!###This was a present for my wife, and so far she has used it for e-mail and Internet access. Soon, she will also use it for reading books, magazines, and other applications as well. Although she is not real technically adept, this has been very easy for her to pick up and begin to use immediately with only very rudimentary training.  Excellent purchase.!###A gift that bought myself and it has been a wonderful note pad for me.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart.!###I opened the package on 12/24 to wrap it for my son and when I looked at the iPad, it did not look new.  The iPad itself was not wrapped in plastic but rather looked like it had been wiped down.  Not all of the contents came with it either.  I kept it because it was to late to return it and disappoint my son.  Very discouraged by this as I thought Amazon had high quality standards.  I dont think I will be ordering from Amazon again.!###Very easy to set up and very easy to use.  wifi only is sufficient for my needs, I mostly use it at home.  I use my Wi-Fi connection through my Verizon hotspot.  I use it to check my email, send and receive text messages, and for surfing the Internet.  I have also downloaded a variety of apps.  Battery life seems to be pretty good.  I have not had any issues with my iPad.!###What a great item this is. I did not want something that was large. I cannot believe all that I do with this ipad.

However, I wanted to try the mini because I thought the iPad 2 was larger than I thought I needed. I was right. The iPad Mini is the perfect size between the iPhone and the regular iPad and I have found many accessories to go with it, especially in the car.!###Only ok.

My girlfriend wanted one of these for xmas. I bought it for her and now I think I use it just as much as she does. The APP choices are spectacular and the clarity is amazing. It is &#34;MADE IN CHINA&#34; (shame on you Apple bring more jobs to the US) and the price is VERY high for this model considering that fact. But if you want a quality product...this is the way to go.!###the size and weight is optimal, but if you have tried retina display, its difficult to go backwards. hope the next mini wouldat least have same spec as ipad 3!###I haven't explored all possible applications yet, however everything I have tried is satisfactory.

She is continually calling me and telling me something new that she loves about it.!###Since I have an Apple iMac 27&#34; computer, and recently dropped our land line and bought an iPhone 5 with T-Mobile, I wanted all of my devices to sync together without any problems.  Since I was going to a reunion, I wanted to take some photos and slideshows that I created to take to the reunion and bought the iPad Mini from this seller.I was going to buy a refurbished iPad Mini from the Apple store but with taxes added from the Apple store, the new one was only $30.00 more and so I decided to get a new one from Amazon with prime time.At first, I did not know if I needed the 16 or 32 GB, but find that the 16 GB will hold everything that I need.  Since my iPhone 5 is a 32 GB, I did not want to spend the extra $100.00 for the 32 GB model.I would buy again from this seller, the product came quickly and I am very happy with my purchase.!###To me there is no other product better than apple items . They are indeed really well made. Their technical suupport staff is always there to help you!!###I am a late-bloomer in everything and have never even had a smart phone. I bought this for the initial purpose of a two-week trip to Mexico. It was perfect. I loved the huge view-finder for photos and the ability to zoom in and crop photos during editing right on the device. With the Audible app and some good foldable headphones I could bliss out on long bus rides listening to audio books or, of course, music. I didn't buy data, but wi-fi was available often enough to let me access my my home and work emails and book hotels or get travel info. as I went. I put a Snugg case on it and it was easy to carry around. I also bought a keyboard but couldn't get on the Internet when the keyboard was connected; however, I'm sure that's my own techno-ignorance and not the I-Pad's fault.!###I shopped around for a while looking to see which iPad to purchase before I finally made my decision. I brought my iPad as 'Like New' condition. I use this for school to take notes, record lectures and my personal downtime. They also take great photos and video. But video takes up ALOT of space. Charging cord and charger were also included with my iPad.I use these as protection for my iPad:Screen protector ( I ended up only using one of the three)Tech Armor Apple iPad Mini Premium HD Clear Screen Protector with Lifetime Replacement Warranty [3-Pack] - Retail PackagingSilicone caseAmzer Soft Silicone Jelly Skin Fit Case Cover for Apple iPad Mini - Hot Pink (AMZ94588)Case shock absorberrooCASE Super Bubble Neoprene Sleeve Case Cover for Apple iPad Mini 7.9" / Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7" / Google Nexus 7" / Samsung GALAXY Tab 2 7.0 (Black / Pink)!###Great size, nice iPad! I'm so glad I bought it! Great quality! Very nice, easy to use and light. Easy to fit my handbag!###This is my 2nd apple product in which i purchase because I am a college student. I bought it so that I am able to download textbooks and also use for my personal business. Ipad mini works great and I am very happy with this product!###I bought it for two main purposes:  reading books and checking/sending email when traveling.  I'm impressed with all the other neat features though.  It does what I wanted and so very much more.  Once I became comfortable with various apps, I was set for much more.  I highly recommend this product.!###It's the perfect size, and it's got the Apple OS. What's not to like? Now that I own it, I very rarely use my desktop PC. I can do it all from this perfect sized Ipad, and from anywhere in or around my home with my wireless router. Absolutely NO regrets from this purchase.!###Went back and forth for about 4 months trying to decide to buy a mini or wait or buy a nook or wait or buy a kindle or so on... there are just so many tablets to choose from. Went ahead and invested in a 64gb model which I wouldn't normally do. Happy I did. The ipad goes with me everywhere and consolidates everything I need to do on my laptop as well as providing me much needed entertainment/productivity while I am on contract living in American Samoa. Yes, it can get boring here on the island and the iPad mini lets me read the news, ponder books, study topics, communicate, and basically feel connected to everywhere else in the world. Did I have buyers remorse? Only during the 2 weeks I had to wait for it to get here to the island---now I'm trying to think of a reason to get a black one too. :)!###I bought this for my husbands thirtieth birthday. He loves it!! Happy birthday to him. No complaints what so ever.!###What can I say but I love it and use it constantly.  It is light enough to carry in my handbag , but big enough to read comfortably and has so many great functions(.  I use mostly the notes (I keep about 10 different notes for shopping lists, birthdays , anniversaries and other important lists for me. the calendar  I read books everyday with my Kindle app. e-mail., pictures and so much more.!###I love the iPad mini. It does everything it's big brother does.  It's the perfect size. I can put it in my purse and take it anywhere.  It's very lightweight.  I got the 64 GB so Ihat I would not run out of space.  This will be perfect for a plane ride I plan to take in a couple of months.!###It was great.  I also have an iPhone so I expected it would do all the same things, except have a larger screen for reading. My only problem was that I should have bought one with more memory. I ate up those 16 gigs fast.!###I had a bunch of American Express points and decided to spend them on purchasing an iPad Mini.  I knew it was the same as a full sized iPad, but smaller.  Well, the size is a bonus. It is easy to take everywhere.  It's light, it's fast. It's easier to type on it than the full-sized iPad, easier to hold, thinner and has surprisingly good sound.I'm completely satisfied.!###My husband and I ordered two black Ipad Mini's within an hour we received a phone call stating that the black Ipad's we originally ordered were all out. Yay! for us,because of this mishap we were offered a more expensive upgrade (saving us 40.00 more for each...a total of 80.00 saved) white Ipad minis AT NO EXTRA CHARGE!! (which rocks because we wanted white ones anyways, but were trying to stay within a budget. To begin with, white electronics always look more sleek, and beautiful (which is why they cost more, right!), the customer service was fast, prompt, polite, and just kick ass!!  A special shout out to STEVEN B who not only called us and gave us this offer but also sent us a personalized letter apologizing (but heck we ended up with such an awesome upgrade we were more than pleased) for the inconvenience, plus a follow up call to check up on the delivery and the products and our satisfaction. Steven B should be valued as an employee because his hospitality was amazing, and he truly cares for his customers- ~**~ eh hem~**~ give him a raise!! Seriously..... the delivery was fast, the service was great, and we are completely overly satisfied, Ipads rock, and we plan on buying another one next year for our kids!! Thanks so much, and chive on!!###I liked it because i have an ipad and our granddaughter wanted one.  She is using it almost constantly and adores it!###I always thought the iPad was a great idea for me but my fingers were way too small and the device too big for my liking. That was enough for me to hold off on buying it and looking elsewhere to get a device that fit my hands and my lifestyle, until they came out with the iPad Mini. I bought the Mini to read, and study for my GMAT exam.The small frame allows me to carry it around in my purse (no need for a monstrous tote) so I can whip it out on my commute to work. I can't comment on it as a device for gaming or excessive app usage since those are not the main reasons why I purchased the device. I can say it is light weight and convenient, and great for books. The iPad Mini is a great choice for the aesthetics and for the basic uses of a tablet.!###My son wanted this Mini IPAD so bad and my daughter got it for him. Ben carries his ipad everywhere he goes. He uses it more then his iphone 4.!###I purchased the iPad Mini as a surprise gift for my hubby.

Looked brand new and came super fast. I do not have a single complaint.!###It was a great buy for the new year. Every Apple store had the mini on back order. I ordered a brand new one for just a few dollars more plus shipping.!###You will need to have the updated apple iTunes to Sinc this with your computer, if your MacBook is too old to update iTunes, you will need to go to an apple store to have them put in the latest iTunes. Don't get talked into buying a later apple operating system ( snow or lion ) the apple story can put in the needed updated iTunes for free.!###I bought this after I purchased the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  The Kindle is heavy (same as the regular iPad).  This is perfect - I was afraid that it would be smaller than I wanted, but it isn't and I find that I use it more often than my kindle.  I'm more familiar with the apps because I have an iPhone (didn't have to repurchase any, like with the Kindle).  I would recommend this to anyone.!###i give 5 stars because it's all i was expecting. A perfectly done apple product that works all the time (until now). I have always been an apple fan and i love the ipad mini!###I've had the Color Nook, Kindle Fire and Nexus, and while there were features on each of them I liked, the only one that came close to the ipad mini awas the Nexus, but the ipad mini is just faster, clearer and far easier to maneuver than all the others. For me, this was just the one! I love it!###I love the portability but the battery doesn't seem to last as long as my kindle fire or my Ipad 2!###these mini's are very stylish and slim also light weight it will get your jobs done with exceptions such as easy connectivity to other devices non apple and this world of technology this quality can make you non grata!###Wi-Fi reception poor compared to my regular iPad.  Needed to be closer to router to be in Wi-Fi range.  Also found that Wi-Fi often got dropped and I had to reconnect.  Decided to return the iPad for this reason.!###LOVE IT EXCELLET GREAT JUST IN TIME. Great shirt no problems at all whit the product, thanks a lot friends.!###Ipad mini's size is perfect to make it easily transportable and easy to hold in one's hand.  It is very light and and portable.  Useable apps are easy to download and make the the mini a multi-purpose tool.  You can read the daily newspaper, get the news from many different sites, view weather including real time radar and use Google maps to find your way.  In addition, the wifi is great in the many businesses that provide free wifi.  I have a large itunes song collection and it easily loaded onto the mini.  As a senior citizen who still works part-time, the mini provides me with the tools to access much of the interests that I have become accustomed to at home with my computer when I am away from home.  Although somewhat pricey, I am impressed with its build quality and performance.  I have Verizon 4 G service with the minimum 2 Gigabites of service per month and find it more than adequate. I would buy the mini again.!###I had a Samsung galaxy tab 2 7.0 and loved it till it nolonger worked, so I bought Apple ipad... Love it.  It is the reason there are so many tabs out now, ipad is king for a reason.  Long live ipad!###I have always been a fan of gadgets.  When I was growing up, there were few gadgets around to satisfy my gadget need; however, since I have reached my "golden years" there are gadgets galore.  My first electronic gadget I bought when was when I was in college - the second time.  A chemistry class was making my little ole numbers-handicapped brain spin.  Then along came the Texas Instruments calculator...WOW, it ran on batteries and figured out things for me.  I was in heaven and so began my love of electronic gadgets.  As a professional I had a plethora of electronic gadgets at my disposal (and I still did anesthesia with a calculator.)  The gadgets did get more complex, and expensive, as I got older and I do have a "thing" for laptop computers and have owned several...I prefer to surf in my lounge chair, with the computer in lap, my feet up, and a tv show in front of me as opposed to sitting at a desk, etc. Then I planned a trip to Europe this year.  I wanted to be able to communicate with the folks back home without having to tote my laptop, so what to do.  Well, BINGO...you got it.  I needed an iPad!  And where do I go to purchase all my best "Good Gadgets"???  To my laptop and Amazon of course!!!  Didn't take long before I located my sweet, little, cool, white, handy-dandy, baby who computes from my lounge chair and any place else with wi-fi...and she weighs much less than the laptop, even fits in my purse.  With Amazon in charge and freebie electronics actually providing the product for my purchase...WOW, what a deal.  Amazon's usually lightening fast, but I had my little, cool, shiny, new, white, baby in less than 2 days - all securely packed and ready to rumble.  And so we have continued to do sending messages/pictures home from Europe, playing games (which I never did before), and reading my fav magazines...SUCH A DEAL!  Give them a try!  Yall take my word for it...it's great!  They're great.!###Very user friendly and easy to learn and operate. .  However my Apple Ipad Mini  does not take the place my Microsoft laptop.!###It does everything you expect it to do. I should have bought a 4g model. Wifi in my house is pretty spotty. I am planning to get a booster, which may increase my use. However, I do not like it as an ereader. It hurts my eyes after a very short time. I have enjoyed a Kindle better for that purpose.!###As i expected comes complete in a plastics wrapped box, with all his stuff in it, the iPad mini works immediately, arrive on time, and apple give us another quality product.!###It's an ipad. I also have the 4th gen ipad, which feels 5 times heavier. I probably should have just bought the ipad mini in the first place. It is easier to type on. My ipad 4th gen gets a lot more hours on the batter though.!###he ipad had small cracks in certain corners, it wasnt 100% clean but it was sealed correctly, dont really understand!###Great product. my kids love it!!!Its smaller and lighter than my old iPad 2, and even cheaper!!!Highly recomended.!###THIS PRODUCT CAME IN GREAT CONDITION, AND IN ORIGINAL BOX.

It allows more mobility without compromising info and ability to respond.  I love the convenient size.!###This is my first iPad. I've owned every other apple item except an iPad.

It fits me very well and I enjoy it.!###This is a nice piece of kit, the screen is clear and photos and videos look really crisp, the OS seems stable and there are countless good apps and games in the appstore to keep you busy and entertained. Email works great and internet is great on a tablet. I found a great book on getting started with iPads Using iPad (Computer Training)!###This Ipad is the perfect gift for my mother who wants to stay in touch with what is going on in the world and for staying in touch with her family. Nice and compact. Shipping was fast.!###I got this for my 8 year old nephew. Love it so much I sent for onefor me,now we can face time each other!!###Bought this for my son as a birthday present.

He loves this and takes it EVERYWHERE we go.!###Bought this for my son, he loved it,I loved it also,  It's is great.  I'm  getting one for myself now!!!!###I am exremely happy with it. I am using a GSM SIM card from an overseas provider and it works just fine, even though it is a Verizon pre-installed unit, it supports GSM just fine. In fact the best buy if you want to use 3G or 4G is the Verizon because it has the widest array of mobile telephony bands.Mine came preinstalled with iOs 6.02 and it is already jailbroken. Sweet!A great product. No regrets. It was not very difficult to adapt to the smaller screen, having used a regular size iPad. It is very bright and clear.Battery duration is quite good. Wi-fi is solid and no problems so far.!###I bought a mini keyboard also which makes a great little portable computer.  My potable computer had aged out and this makes a great tool for note takig.!###I love it so much that this is the second one I buy!

It's fast, light, thin, and connects easily to wifi.  Perfect size for the kindle app as well, works better than most e-readers for reading purposes.  The screen is actually much larger than the 7" tablets with the standard aspect ration, and has a nice width to it.  The width to height ratio is more toward the width side of things than most tablets, which I strongly prefer and it means bigger text with news articles and less scrolling.  The resolution isn't great but it's fine because of the small screen.!###I have read quite a lot about Apple's corporate philosophy, and I'm just happy to know that their spirit is perfectly reflected through their products. Keep the integrity Jobs guys! :)!###As you may know, this is my first iPad I got with my own money, and it feels awesome. The screen, I thought was going to be to small. Turns out, it's just perfect. The battery life is just amazing. I can leave the house at 7:00am and don't have to put it to church until I'm ready to sleep around 11:00pm. I use it for school and it's so convenient when I have to go sing at events I have all my lyrics in one place. I am a happy person.!###was contemplating the nexus 7 or a Samsung. after playing with all 3 I decided on the mini. its the perfect size. the 7 is a bit too small.... makes it feel like a bigger cellphone. the 10&#34; are too big; might as well buy a small laptop. the mini is right in the middle and the perfect size @ almost 8&#34;. light, great for travel, and does everything I need.screen is great quality and speak is not bad for a tablet.I bought mine used on amazon and it came in perfect. not a single scratch on it. would highly recommend.!###This iPad Mini exceeds my expectations in every way.  I initially made the purchase so that I could read in bed, but quickly discovered it handles most everything else I need to do.  I almost never look at my laptop these days except to load music (which automatically downloads to my iPad) or sort through photographs.  It seamlessly loads everything from my iTunes account and connects to my Apple TV.  I bought the Wi-Fi only and so far this has not been an issue for me.  I suspect that down the road I will purchase one with a data plan and retinal scan.  For those of you who are undecided about which iPad to purchase, I personally love my mini!  I found the regular-sized iPad to be too large for my liking, i.e., a bit bulky to carry around.  I am extremely pleased with this purchase and the seller shipped the item to me promptly and well-packaged.!###My wife has the full size iPad, and we both love using it, but this smaller &#34;Mini&#34; is a little easier to handle and travel with. Being an Apple product, the design, fit and finish are top notch, and there are tons of accessories already available for it. Battery life has been very good, and the apps have been designed to work perfectly with the smaller screen of the Mini. Even though it is a little smaller, it is easy to use and all of the apps are easily viewed on the crystal clear screen. I would recommend a case that can be used to prop up the iPad, so that you can view it easily while watching videos or web browsing. Everyone in my family enjoys using it, from my youngest to the eldest, they find IOS very intuitive and easy to navigate at any age. The learning curve on this is very flat and gradual to anyone that doesn't know Apple products. I recommend an iPad to anyone wanting something bigger than a smart phone, but smaller than a laptop. There are great apps for business, banking, planning, gaming and everything else in between to make life more organized and more fun for the user.!###I really spent a lot of time researching tablets before I decided on the iPad Mini.  The device is light and because I purchased the 64g it can store all the music, movies & e-books that I have. My wife who so  isn't so keen on tablets uses it regularly with ease.  Good bang for your buck and practical.!###It is just what I expected. I would recommend it to everyone. It is handy to use anywhere you are at.!###Excellent item I will recommend this to others because:Overall experienceSizePortabilityScreen definitionQualityPriceCloud service... etc!###I have anorher ipad, 3 ipods and and iphone & I love all of them. Easy to use. I wasn't sure about gettint it in white but it looks great.!###IPad mini is a lot of fun to use, the price was very fair. Product just as described. I use it all the time. Delivery was very fast too, I recommend this seller!###First I got a Kindle- charge connection broke , Got a Fire-charge connection wouldn't stay connected. So we gave up on them and got an Apple, Can't telll much different yet but only had three days. Seems fine, nice size, easily read, everything transfered.!###I have an inexpensive wifi Android tablet and this one.What I like about this over the Android tablet which has Jelly Bean 4.3 is that this has a lot more functionality. It costs about twice as much, but for that- I don't have to use workarounds to stream Amazon Prime, and there are a lot of productivity apps that work best on iPad- the Android versions almost seem to be after thoughts.This is sleek, lightweight, easy to hold in one hand and the screen is very touch responsive. The display looks really good. Using the Kindle app- the graphic novels look great. I don't actually recommend it for serious reading because it is back lit which can be wearying to read for extended lengths.Battery time is pretty good with this too. At this point, it gets used a few hours a day and needs to be charged every other day.On a personal note- my husband likes using this at night to stream shows, and we either cuddle and watch them together, or I'll go to sleep. It's not as bright as having the television on and he can use a headset if I'm trying to sleep. It's really nice.!###An awesome companion on those long days at work....I don't leave home without it. I'm waiting for my little cover for it I want something I can keep it safe and preferably white. Still not fully done with how I need it to help me from day to day, but I'm having fun trying to figure it out...!###I always used Android tablets for both work and personal, but just switched to the IPad mini . This was one of the best choice of my life. It was one of the most easiest tablets to learn by far and has everything I needed for both work and personal. I would recommend this to everyone for everything from personal, school and work.!###This was a gift for my adult daughters birthday.  I already had an ipad and she liked it so I got her the ipad mini. She loves it. Shipping was prompt.!###I purchased this for travelig and I think it will be a perfect to replace a laptop and e-reader.Love the size and convenience.!###Researched a lot of ipads and settled on this one because it has the latest technology but is smaller and less expensive than the newest regular sized ipads.  My son got it for his birthday (he is 10) and loves it!  It is actually pretty big.  I expected smaller.!###Acquired on PRE-ORDER, received on Date of Release.There has been many discussions as either to call it a reduced IPad or a glorified IPod Touch / IPhone. I can say from experience, as I have all of the three other items as well ... It is not fair to classify this item as either.Yes, it is true it is an intermediate size in between the 4-5 inch Touch-Phone and the 9 inch Pad. But with exception to certain other characteristics, it is for a class of its own. The pod/phone can't really be considered feasible for VIDEO Entertainment. For that the PAD is the only really feasible unit.Now, if I already have the big pad, why would I go for the mini as well, ... In summary .... Portability .... Plain and simple. I take it and stick it in my back or side pocket of the 24-7's or the inner pocket of a jacket .... And it is like unnoticeable. That's one thing I couldn't do with my regular IPad.Would I prefer the mini to the regular ... For communications and browsing and book reading ( for which I consider the 4/5 inch Pod and Phone way too small) sure, it is fine. But I still hold on to my IPad 2 for video entertainment, because, as Jobs put it, &#34;for that purpose, anything less than a 10&#34; unit is too small.&#34;.For regular users, I suggest a SCREEN PROTECTOR, and a HARD CASE, preferably with screen cover as well.But in summary, a highly recommended item... You won't regret it.!###I have to love it, its not as big, bulky and heavy as the regular iPad yet its big enough to display text and still be readable without forcing your eyesight (I'm 43 and beginning to get presbyopia).!###We are loving our mini. Its great for work and my daughter loves to use it. There are so many good apps.!###Seller delivered on promised time. This Is a good tablet for internet surfing, movies YouTube etc. it nice and small fit well in one hand!###The day it came I ran out the door to get it. When I opened the package it was just as advertised, perfect condition. I bought it refurbished, and the battery doesn't really last ten hours but I'm assuming it is because of the previous use. My only suggestion would be to include an item history with refurbished products, where it came from, any previous use, etc...It does everything I want it to, and more than I thought it could. Very pleased with the item and with the service.!###Excellent product. I changed my Ipad2 for this Ipad mini. More confortable and simple to travel. Really, it was an excellent decision.!###I have the standard size ipads but i bought this one with verizon just for out of town travel and to use it as a gps unit on a screen i can see in our motorhome. I wanted a pay as you go tablet that would cost less than having to turn on an air card for for a week here and there!###It is fun and easy to use and performs all functions I have need for. Would recommend it to anyone.l!###Excelent product, i love it, it's just something that i want for some time and is for my wife, i'm sure she will be deligthful using it!###I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband. He loved it. It is everything he wanted. His only complaint is that he wishes apple products diddn't require an internet connection to set up in the beginning.!###I love this ipad mini and it really serves its purpose!  I certainly would reccomend this product to anyone who is looking to purchase an ipad mini!!###I carry it everywhere with me . I  mainly use my to read and play games.  It looks absolutely wonderful and is very easy to use . It can be linked up with your iPhone as well. Many wonderful feature. Highly recommend it .!###THIS MINI WAS BOUGHT FOR SOMEONE, AND THEY WERE REALLY EXCITED, IT PUT A SMILE ON THEIR FACE, I WOOULD RECOMMEND THIS SELLER TO EVERYONE.!###Shipped fast.  I have bought many electronic gadgets and must say this is one of the best and most versatile.  It handles PDFs nicely.  The only thing I don't like about this tablet (as well as all others) is the LCD screen, which I hope changes in the future.!###Got this for my husband for our anniversary and he already has an IPod, but I thought he could use that for all his music, he loves that thing, and has so much music on it. but I thought that by getting him the tablet, he could transfer his games, pics, and whatever else he keeps on there to the IPad Mini. I about died when he kept it!!! He's a very difficult man to buy for! We've been married 29 years, so I was like I'm going for it, I can always send it back with Amazon. But he loves it!!! I don't use it, I have my own stuff. Kindle Fire HD, which rocks and we both have Iphones, so you can't lose with an Apple product!!! He's on it every night, now he's buying more music for his other device and has what he needs on his IPad Mini. And it's so thin, so if we go away, it goes in our Electric Gadget bag, with our chargers and it's awesome!! And on the day I bought this whole package, the IPad Mini, the case that shuts it off and turns it on, and the protector sheets, I paid under $380 for everything!!! It pays to be an Amazon Prime Member!!!! You get the best deals, no hassles on returns, you have 30 days to return something, and if you have a problem, all you have to do is call them!! I love the ease and the customer service!!! I've yet to have any kind of issue with Amazon!!! For this whole package, it said 2-3 days max for delivery!! It was here the next night at 5pm!! I was shocked!!!! But, it was here and that's what I love about Amazon!!! They ROCK!!! Now reviewing all the books I've bought for my Kindle, I'll try to get to them!!! LOL I already have tons of books, and every single day I get BookBub in my Email and it's the books on sale or FREE books!!! Amazing....I love them!!! I do most of my shopping on Amazon and because I'm a Prime Member, I don't pay for shipping. I hate going to Malls...you get better prices on here for Bluray movies, electronics, kids toys, and shipping is free as long as it's a Prime item. I've talked enough!! Amazon ROCKS and I'll always come here first before I go anywhere else.!###When will I ever learn - Nothing beats an Apple product!  After several non-Apple MP3 players I finally bought a Apple Nano. What a difference buying it made.  Imitators never seem to make a product that can do what Apple can do (but I'm still a PC believer.). 2 years ago I bought a BB Playbook because I had a BB phone.  I soon learned BB had over promised. App development was lacking.  Same thing with the Amazon Fire I brought a year later. I had high hopes for their Fire HD but alas the apps I needed weren't available for the Fire HD. I also heard the $50 annual 4G connection was only good for the 1st year after that AT&T would charge outrageous rates to keep the 4G connection. Seems like the critical apps I needed were only being developed for Apple IOS.  I checked used pricing and was amazed that even broken Apples were going for what a new true Android went for. That speaks well for Apples resale value. I've had my mini for a week now and I'm not sorry it's soooo much better.  I chose the mini because I prefer the 7.9&#34; size over a 10&#34; model.  Sure the model 4 has a faster processor and retina screen but for double the price I paid for my mini those improvements just aren't worth it.!###I like most of the features of the mini. I am no techie so my input is limited but the unit has a poor wifi antenna. Apple denies it but it is a fact. Check online postings by other users. Also, apple prevents the downloading of adobe flash making some websites less useful!###I bought mine at Walmart. Replaced my 10inch iPad two, I gave that to my hubby. I wanted to go mini, because the ten inch made my purse heavy and barely fit. Works just like my other one, just smaller. Everything is the same except the mini has Siri.!###It was a gift.  Arrived with no operating instructions or warranty information in the box.  Just the I-Pad.  Would not purchase from this supplier as a warranty and even the most basic instructions should have been included.!###Love sent galaxy back because in failed after just a week or so. Glad I switched. Faster that the green robot.!###What can I say?  It is an Apple product and just great.  My granddaughter, who is five, is reading at a 4th grade level.  I attribute it to the apps on the iPad.!###I love my new ipad! I'm a first time ipad user so I doubt my review will be helpful since I have nothing to compare to. This is also my first tablet, I do use my s4 for a lot of stuff but now I use this ipad, to me it's basically a cell phone with a bigger screen. I very rarely use my laptop anymore, pretty sure computers are becoming an old technology. It's like when DVD players came out and VCRs became a thing of the past! I would definitely recommend an ipad as your first tablet. Very easy to use and convenient!###Love my iPad mini.  I take it everywhere with me.  The pictures come out so nice and are easy to take - just a click and you have a beautiful picture.!###Product came quickly, smooth sale, everything came as it was explained. IPad mini works great. Great tablet for all my music, ebooks, games, and movies. It's nice to have something alittle bigger than smartphone to view media but not as cumbersome as a laptop.!###I  have not review before,because i did not have the time,but I have to say that apple always give us what we needThey  go just at front list when we say technologyThak you!!!!###I wasn't sure how I would like the mini after having a larger iPad, but I really like it.  Fit's easily in my purse and charges quickly when needed.!###I actually bought this for a friend and he loves it. I have one myself and love the size because it fits in my pocketbook.!###I have a 7 inch android tablet that I really like, but had heard so much about the Ipad that I just wanted to give it a try. I chose the mini for the price and the size, and I have been extremely happy with it. The slightly larger screen adds a little more viewing area without making the tablet too big to go in my purse, and I have found that a couple of the apps I favor seem to run smoother in the Ipad than on the android.!###The mini is great! I love that Siri can speak text from my iBook and the foreflight app is great for flying! For pilots, I prefer the mini over regular sized iPad since the mini is the same size of my regular kneeboard. The color reverse feature is awesome for night flying too, I could see my charts without a flashlight and without a blinding light! Also the charge lasts a long time but I always bring a car charger and plug it in while flying just to be safe. I highly recommend this product!!!###I love my new mini! It fits perfectly in my purse and is still big enough for me to see what I'm doing and get lots of work done!!###Very light and portable. I love it. The full iPad experience in a smaller version. The big iPad is too big for my taste. iPad Mini is perfect for watching movies, reading books, surfing the net, shopping, and listening to music. People complain about the screen resolution but I don't have any problems reading or looking at it. You can notice a difference if you have an iphone. But its not a huge difference. Its wonderful to have a small tablet. Apple has done exceptionally well with iPad Mini. Go for it, but it if you can.!###The best way to describe this iPad, is to say it puts the world at your thumbs! I was a diehard PC. Got tired of viruses and other issues. Once you take a bite out of an apple, you never go back!!###I love this product.  I like the mini's smaller size over the iPad.  Great product. I would highly recommend it.!###This is a wonderful product. It is excelent to use to work and free time. I am very happy with my buy.!###I'm a big Apple fan and have had all the iPhones. I currently have the iPhone 5 so I decide, after a lot of research. to go with the iPad Mini. After giving it a full charge I started running it thru its paces, registering and getting all my favorite Apps loaded. Then I started to notice that I was losing battery very quickly. An average of 1% every 2 minutes. So I went into settings and did all the tricks; lower brightness, turned off notifications, manual email receive, etc.. Even though it did improve slightly it was not dramatic. I was also noticing that it was slow and had quite a bit of lag compared to my iPhone 5. I ran some video and it was constantly buffering. So I did some speed test across my WiFi and found it was running at about half the speed of my iPhone 5 and laptop. So I decided to do a hard reset,  bleed the battery to zero, then charge it to 100% and then reload everything. Well the charging took forever but I figured this was the first time to zero and back so I'll give it a chance. I started loading it back and had all the same issues. Bummer. So I opened a case with Apple. They are excellent BTW. After the basic testing and trouble shooting Apple decided that they would start by replacing the battery. But I decided rather than continuing to put in a lot of extra time trying to get this unit to work for me I would just return it. Amazon was great with the return process. I give them 5 stars. Apple support was great. I give them 5 stars. My particular iPad Mini. 1 star. Hopefully it was just a fluke bad unit.!###Device performed very slow.  Switching for app to app took several seconds.  Battery life was abysmal and the screen hurt my eyes with its poor resolution.  I bought a galaxy tablet instead and am completely satisfied.!###Okay, I was a huge apple fan for many years.  In spite of their walled garden mentality, I've always felt that Apple was the best money could buy.  However, I've slowly soured on Apple's business model.  The Ipad mini is nothing more than a miniturazed ipad 2.  The interals with exception of the camera arer exactly the same.  So, when one looks at what he/she is paying for it's outdated 2 year old technology.  This device was outdated and obsolete, before it even hit store shelves.  What does this mean for the consumer?  It means that as soon as the new Retina Mini comes out with 2gigs of ram, you will likely need to upgrade.  Let's consider here that apple has a history of forced obsolescence.  This means they can and often do abandon a previous generations product, when the new one comes out.  An example of this can be seen in the Ipad 1.  The first gen Ipad arrived in April of 2010.  In November of 2012, Apple stopped supporting it with the latest ios update, after ios 5.  This means that customers that purchased the 64 gig cellular model for over $850.00 now have an overpriced paperweight...but at least we still have the beautiful logo to admire.  When apple first introduced the Ipad, the company promoted it as a virtual replacement to the laptop and while I never really subscribed to this notion, I do feel as though at nearly a $1000 dollar expense, this should buy me a lot more than a shade over 2 years before the company forces the customer to upgrade, or be left behind.  Now, there will be those that say, "Apple doesn't force you to do anything."  I beg to differ.  Yes, they indeed do.  Outside of music purchases in Itunes, do I as a consumer have the right to use my digitally purchased content on a non apple device?  The answer is no.  So, if I choose not to upgrade my old ipad, my content is locked tight in Itunes and I have no means to access it.  This is the nature of a "walled garden" and I as a consumer understand this.  But when apple supporters buy in to this(at a high price point I might add) we receive no assurances that our purchase has a shelf life of greater than a couple years at best, or 6 months at worst.  See again, those who purchased an ipad 3 only to be surprised by the quick release of the 4.  By the way, Apple no longer manufactures the 3.  So if you have problems with it, you have to pay for the cost of repairs at this point or purchase a 4.  It's just a matter of time before consumers of the Ipad 3 begin to feel the very same pain of those who puchased a first gen Ipad.My biggest issue with the mini?  The price.  Come on apple...The ipad Mini cost by most accounts $112 dollars to make and is sold at a starting price of $329...Give me a break.  As we go up in storage capacity, it will cost us no less than $100 dollars...this is pure lunacy.  I am no fanboy of any brand, but if we look at Google and Amazon's investment in cloud storage, we begin to see how rediculous it is to pay for onboard storage.  Apple's Icloud is nothing more than a sync service; it is not a true cloud based service.  Apple has no insentive to invest in true cloud service because to do so would hurt their bottom line, because they would not be able to charge the consumer for extra storage, as the cloud eliminates this need, for the most part.  The cloud is the biggest threat to Apple's business model and would surely drive profit margins down even further than they are already.  Please understand I am not an apple hater; but I am simply no longer a blind consumer and am informed enough to see that in this case, apple is successfully marketing and selling repackaged crap in a smaller bag...but again, at least we still get the nice apple logo, which of course comforts us and helps us to reaffirm our fabulous purchase of a brand new old idevice.!###Ipad is the only apple product to get heavier and hotter with every generation.  Everything else gets slimmer and cooler and thankfully the ipad mini has been redesigned from the ground up to be the slim sleek product apple is known for.  Unfortunately they used cheaper tech to lower cost while charging a premium for a small tablet.  If they had matched the specs of the larger ipad OR charged less to better match the pricing of other 7" tablets I'd have one right now.  Yes it is true I do not own a mini, but I have owned an ipad 2 and played around with my coworkers mini.The following are from my brief use of my coworkers mini and so this is not an in depth or long term insight on this product, but I think many of the points are valid.PROS:-Size, weight, thin profile - all considered standard on most apple products.-Lightning connector... it's true they have hosed everyone with their new connector but their old standard 15-pin was becoming dated... too large and not reversible.-OS is streamlined and comfy, those that own apple products are at home and folks that are not tech savvy are more comfortable with this OS-Tons of appsCONS:-Pricing considering that android competition is selling at $199-OS is limiting. No where near the customization available to android users.-Stereo speakers are welcome, but not when they are placed one inch apart, come on apple...-Itunes is a pain (not as bad as Microsoft, but still cumbersome at times)COMMENTS:-People keep stating NFC is a con.. it's an apple, get over it. buy an android product-People complain about lack of Retina display.  Get over it, the pixel size is still comparable with the ipad 2 and the goal was portability, not pixel density.INNOVATION:I think apple would benefit from incorporating GPS into every product they sell and then offering free 3G for all location services, no email, no internet, BUT free location updates for all those apps that rely on location services.  Maybe your comments won't post until you get home (or a free wifi location), but you would get the benefits of integrated gps for accurate navigation and location info.  Off my soapbox.-!###We already own MacBooks and wanted something smaller to take on trips. This is IT! It has all the features and available apps of the full-size iPad and is another outstanding Apple product!!###I've had the 16GB Mini since November but was running out of room because I'm loading so many apps. I even had to remove some of my Kindle books and Zinio magazines to make room. Now, I won't have to worry about running out of space.!###It has the perfect size to be carried with you in your bag or bag pack. Very light, so you don't feel like adding weight to your daily activities. Haven't used for long time, but I had great experience whith other Mac devices.!###had ipad 2  moved to the mini and i love it  was surprised about siri too perfect size for travel!###This product is amazing and so cute. It is very light, I ordered it in black and looks really slick, the graphics are great, couldn't be happier. I even use it for sketching with my bamboo paper, netflix, skyping on the go, and even for presentations to clients while having lunch (I'm a graphic designer). Two thumbs up.!###First of all I need to say that this product arrived perfectly on time. It was as brand-new as you would have bought in the Apple store.The product itself is a top class technology. iPad Mini is very mobile, which is the biggest advtange over the regular iPad. It has all necessary and far from necessary functions. Battery life is absolutely amazing. Display quality is not as high as retina, however, you will not even think about its bad sides. If you are an iPhone user and this is your first iPad - you will need to get used to the little specifics of the keyboard on Mini. 1080P HD video is just a beauty to watch. No lagging whatsoever, just pure class. Overall this is a high class product that will let you feel the whole world in your one hand.!###This is perfect for reading(kindle), checking email, storing and editing photos, etc. I have an iPhone and an 11" macbook air. This is the perfect in-between. I Amos happy to have this for travel.!###Sent this item as a gift for my Dad and Mom.  They love it, especially doing 'Face-Time' with all of their children!!###I had wanted an Ipad Mini for a while. I have a 10" android tablet but it is a bit heavy for reading my Kindle books on. It was also not as easy to connect to free wi-fi hot spots. The mini is super easy to connect to the free wi-fi connections at my favorite coffee haunts. I have an Ipod touch but it is just too small to read books on for long periods of time. It is fine to quickly check web pages but not for prolonged browsing. (Aging eyes) I debated about waiting for the predicted "retina display" on the Mini 2. On comparing the retina display Ipad to its non retina-display counter part I decided that the difference was not THAT great. The only time I could tell was on video playback. On that I could see a substantial difference.The retina display Ipad was MUCH better. Since what I want to use the Mini for will be #1: Reading my Kindle books and #2: Web browsing, I did not feel it was worth a possible 6 month wait for a retina display mini. I bought a keyboard case so that I can type emails easier on it. Will I regret not waiting for the retina display mini? Maybe, time will tell. If you are forever waiting for the next great thing you will never buy anything.!###Great product, lighter and very fast!!!Also excelent battery life!Its greater than kindle fire because it runs a fully loades operating system instead of a shrinked oneInternet browsing is as smooth as a computer plus extremely portability!###Love the iPad mini.This was the perfect Christmas gift. I would recommend the iPad mini. The size is very convenient.!###This device has been great for me. It has a ton of great features and is very easy to use. Great device at first glance.!###The best tablet out there in the Market today, Very smooth and quite fast. Another great product from apple...also the resale value on apple products are great...!###It's an Apple, it's smaller and it's great!  I like it better than the iPad because it's smaller but have all the cool functions as the iPad.  Siri works great, too.  Love it!!!###Great product! Love the size and great gift for the wife and her daily business ventures. No problems or issues!###i've had the iPad mini for about a month now and i find myself addicted to it.  the compact size and light weight makes it very ideal to bring around so i take it everywhere with me including office, business trips and personal use.  cannot really find anything to complain about other than not having the retina display, but then, the smaller size screen kind of compensates display quality.  perfect holiday gift, in fact, i love it so much i bought a couple of units more as x'mas presents.  happy holiday~!###this is a another great product from apple. I own different tablets and this one has many advantages as well as some disadvantages, but for the most part each tablet is unique in its functionality.!###I have had the original iPad for a couple of years now and found it was time to upgrade to something a little more current in terms of OS.  So far, I have really enjoyed the smaller size without feeling like I was giving up too much screen.  I use it mainly at work and reading in my spare time.  Overall I have enjoyed the downsizing.!###Love it Especially the size. Great resolution. Great for traveling with it. Easy to handle and store while traveling. Happy I chose it.!###10000 more portable tan the regular iPad. Love it! Now I use it more than my previous conventional iPad. Great buy.!###This is my first mini ipad and I love it!!!!!! The speaker is great and needs no extra speakers for sound .Graphics are the best.And great color. It takes great pictures.And I can play some of facebook games with the ois.The battery last for a long long time even when the light stays on. Walmart is a lot cheaper I paid 299.00 and it's that price daily.I also love Apple products.I would reckamend this to friends .!###It is the perfect size for me.  It suits my purpose and I think it will be sufficient for my use.!###Just a quick note *I bought this item on Ebay so it will not show up on here*This Ipad is awesome....I am going to sell my Ipad 2 to my brother...but I was impatient for him to get the money together so I hopped online and bought one (after vigorous reviewing of course). Man was I happy...Because of the smaller size I find it a lot sharper looking than the Ipad 2 (not the 3 and 4 because it is lacking "retina".) But I have not noticed a large difference between the quality of the iphone 5 screen vs the ipad mini.  Also, the wifi connection is out of this world, I can get signal in places that none of my other gadgets (besides my laptop) can reach!I give this an easy 5/5 for a tablet, I am not a fanfail or whatever they call it now-a-days I enjoy all systems to a degree but absolutely love Ipads.!###I'm an old salt as far as gadgets go but after much pondering I decided to join today's technology generation..boy did I waste lots of time.  This tablet has made things so convenient for me; I can do so much more than just read books with it.  I was undecided for a long time; should I buy a Kindle or iPad? Well sure glad I went with the mini iPad, so much I can do with it.!###It is perfect. It got here fast and the price was unbeatable. I would highly recommend this company and I will use them again!###I bought this for my fiancee for her birthday and she absolutely loves it, she can't put it down...I think I made a good choice.!###I am enjoying my iPad mini. I can now carry everything I have on my iPad in my purse. The order was delivery with promptness and in great quality.!###An older friend of mine wanted a &#34;pad&#34; she calls it so we both made a deal that I would sell mine to her at a discounted rate and she would give me enough for a mini so that's what we did! I don't regret it! I love my mini! I use it everyday and to me since I've been simplifying my life for the last year or so this was a great investment for me because &#34;Less is More&#34;! I can do everything on my mini as I did on my iPad 2 with no problems! No regrets at all! No complaints here! :)!###My ipad mini can do everything i want it to do, and takes up less space than the ipad and i like it better.!###This &#34;mini&#34; iPad is no baby brother in the family.  It delivers the same visual quality and accessibility as those that came before it.  The price is right and you can carry it anywhere.!###I love this ipad mini despite it has not the retina display or a faster processor. It is light, slim and nice comfortable screen. The best device available for reading purposes. I guess the white color is better as the black is sensitive to finger prints.!###I love the ease of use on the keyboard, the size and weight are perfect for laying in bed reading!!!  The light weight make it very management and yet the screen is a perfect size.  Wow!!!!  You outdid yourself Apple!!###I received my iPad mini in the mail about a week ago and have been nothing short of impressed. I had previously owned a first generation Kindle Fire. At first I had planned to purchase a 8.9 Kindle Fire HD but after I read the reviews about the ads and Skype-only camera, I decided to look elsewhere. A few days later, I heard that the iPad mini had been announced and decided to get that instead. I purchased mine directly from Apple rather than Amazon due to the cheaper price tag for the WiFi only and AppleCare. This is technically an iPad 2 crammed into a smaller size with the addition of the new Lightning charger and Siri. But it is far superior to my Kindle Fire in every way. I can do everything I could do on my Kindle Fire and more. I suggest if you're hunting for a tablet, ditch the KF lineup this year and pick up one of these lucky charms. They have a bigger price tag, but its worth it.!###I've had the original since it first came out and I still absolutely love it and still use it daily for ready books on kindle and consuming news before bed.  The only reason I decided to get another iPad is for facetime.  The mini works as I would expect and the only thing that I do not like is I feel like the battery is somewhat weak compared to the original iPad.!###I had an original ipad and thought it was very nice but the size of the mini is perfect.  I've used this product everyday since I got it.!###I am no where near a tech guru.  I have a Samsung Galaxy Stellar and  a Windows based Dell PC.  So purchasing anything Mac is having to learn to do things differently, of course as far as compatibility with apps, etc.  This is a treat for my senses and I love it.  I am just starting to scratch the surface with all that you can do with this product to begin with.  I graduated just before computers started to be used in schools and became the norm for the generation after me.  I learned on an Apple but haven't been able to afford them since. I am good at learning as I go I am not afraid to press the a button and ask questions later to get to where I want to be so I do travel somewhat dangerously but for me that is how I discover the best things on an unknown device.  Push and read directions late is my motto.  Haven't ruined anything irreparably as yet.It is more enjoyable for me and I do understand the price range in comparison to my experiences it does seem fair.  I do think that the Mac offers a much cleaner, organized, classier, user friendly....etc. etc. version above the competition.  I had no idea that the things I can do on this even existed technologically so that should tell you I'm somewhat jaded from lack of my limited tech frontiers and how much things have really changed since 1984 when I graduated.  Trying to keep up is hard because it keeps changing faster and faster.  So I'll hang on until I'm to old to care or remember what my password is.!###I love my iPad-mini.  I use it primarily as my reading device and for web browsing.  I also watch Netflix or Amazon videos on it and use all my banking apps.  Great user experience!!###The iPad mini 64gb is my 3rd ipad...I've had the first and second ipad and I loved them. I will admit I was the main person saying how stupid it was for apple to come out with an ipad mini and I was wrong! After reading reviews I decided to upgrade my 2nd generation ipad to an ipad mini and I must say I'm impressed. When I went to the apple store I looked at the ipad mini and ipad 4 and I didn't notice a severe difference between the retina screen and ipad mini screen. I love my mini it's so light weight and I put it in my purse and literally take it every where. I use to do the same with my ipad 2nd generation but it was very heavy. If you're looking to buy something that is portable light weight and to replace anything that you already have this is it. I'm a college student and I use my mini more than I use my laptop...I have my textbooks on it write papers read powerpoints listen to lectures and record my teachers in class on it. I also read books magazines and watch tv and movies on it as well as playing games and sketching. "addicted to sims and cut the rope". My roommate and I have figured out how to do so much on these ipads that we barely use a computer or paper anymore. I would highly recommend this ipad to anyone. I don't feel like I "down graded" at all by replacing my ipad 2 with my mini it was a great trade off. I love it and hope that my review swayed any doubters into purchasing. I'm truly obsessed with it. Griffin Technology Survivor for iPad Mini, Black/Black (GB35918) &lt;&lt;&lt;--- link to my favorite case that I highly recommend as well.!###When I first saw the iPad mini I thought people would be crazy to pay $329. I thought you'd get a lot less in a tablet but spend more money. I was very wrong. After just one day I freaking love this thing. It's such a high level of quality in a smaller size that I could see paying $349 for it. It's almost freakishly thin and light. It might be alien technology actually.I picked up the white version and its fantastic. Awesome aluminum back with a very sharp chrome bezel around the front edges. Even though its not a retina display I have no problem with it at all. The picture quality is still great and the colors and images totally pop. At a foot away you wouldn't know the difference.Great to read books. Great to surf the Internet. Great for sending emails and texts. So solid feeling. It doesn't fit in any other category of smaller tablet. And maybe that's the point. Apple chose to go smaller like the other competitors, but at the same time they paved their own path. I'm using this more than my big iPad now.!###This is a great iPad mini. Almost the perfect one but thereis no perfect.... The battery life is also amazing. Should be good for personal and or buisness use!###My iPad mini is very great!!  I'm having great experience with it just after opening my iPad.  I have never had a iPad before.  But, since I have a iPad, I have notices what huge feature I had missed with the iPad!!###I am a huge apple fan and really love the size and portability of the ipad mini. I travel a lot and the mini fits perfect with that.!###Apple iPad mini is good to carry outdoor, even I have new iPad . It's lightly and smoothly to use!###Love it was very quick getting here and everything they said it would be daughter has a brand new toy!###Great teaching tool for children with learning disabilities.  I purchase the Ipad minnie as a backup for his Ipad 4....he likes the Ipad mini better.....who knew...lol.!###The iPad mini was a great hit with my friend when I gave it to him at CHristmas.  It works great and looks wonderful.!###Love it !  Wish the font at the top and sides could be made bigger.  The main page can be enlarged, but he can't see the top bar and side bar very well.!###todo muy bien responsables ................llego a tiempo .... .. .. . . .. .. . . . . . .!###love the nice slim look, not heavy when you traveling a must have when youre always on the go and need the internet!###I had been thinking about buying an Ipad, but once the Ipad Mini came out, I started to consider that instead simply because it was a more convenient size. It fits perfectly in my purse and is just the right size for my rather small hands. I can see how a guy with big hands might have an issue with the Mini... Its worked perfectly right out of the box. I don't really use it for work or anything like that, its just a play device, really. Though I run all my finances off it too. We have two in our house now and no complaints from us. I love snuggling up in bed and checking my email or watching a movie on it. Its just the right size for that sort of thing.!###Small and thin, just what i wanted. Great for reading books. The weigh is perfect. I only taught it came with headphones!###While a little more pricey than other tablets, I actually prefer the smaller size and it makes it easier to carry around.  I use this for my ebooks for school!###Just as the other products of apples. It is the representive of iPad.Lighter than others. You can hand it when you lie in the bed. Surfing with you fingers.!###Nice device! Smaller, lighter than iPad, but very fast as iPad New.Great Apple! Good job! Bravo Jobs! Apple forever!!###I have an iPod Touch I can't live without. I use it everyday. It is not the newer one but I was thinking of getting the 5th generation Touch that has the retina display or the mini iPad even though it did not. I have an iPhone 4S so it does not have the retina either. I was really leaning towards to the Touch but decided to get the 32 iPad mini in white.I bought mine at a store that has BB as the initials and they also have an offer for a free Belkin cover/case that I love! When I unpacked it, it was mostly charged so it did not take long to charge the rest of it. I thought I would have a hard time converting over from the 30 pin connector but have not missed it.I own an Acer tablet that is too big to hold and heavy. My 4th generation iPod Touch is too small so I am glad I decided to go with the mini iPad. It is literally just right! It feels good in my hands, does not weight much, looks gorgeous, and is so easy to use!If you are on the fence like I was, I don't think you will regret it. I would get the 32 over the 16 though for it is only about $100 more and double the space. I have a 16 iPhone it filled it up in five months.I am happy I own it and regret not getting it sooner. If you are unsure, try it out in person and you will see what you are missing out on.!###I highly recommend it. It is an awesome item. I love it. It so easy to use. It is very fast and works very good with any wi-fi connection. It is one of the best thing I ever had!!###I paid a pretty decent price for the ipad and it came in perfect condition. There were absolutely no delays in the shipping. I was actually shocked that it came in so quickly, probably less than a week. Overall, I am a very happy and satisfied customer!!###ProsLove that its small but not to smallLooks greatFastBattery lifeConsNoneOne thing I want to see for apple is to lower the price.!###So light and well built with tons of apps. My wife got the full size and I got the mini. I find the mini so much more portable.!###It's very lovely, thin, and petite. I could not be happier with my purchase. I use it for class. And it's spectacular!###I bought this to help me with school work.  It ihas so many great features.  It is just the right size for my hands.  It had great resolution, so it is easy to see and read.  The camera takes fantastic pictures.  It is easy to use and customize.  There are so many free and inexpensive apps to use with it.  This is a great iPad for anyone.!###Very great product fast shipping! As soon as it came in i started to download apps and browse the internet everything is working fine and fast very slim and lightweight!!###There are two schools.1) The Apple way2) The Open wayIf you want an environment where you can work seamlessly in all aspects without &#34;hurdles&#34; of upgrading this, upgrading that, is it compatibile with this, do I need a service pack xyz, etc, etc. You know what I mean, Apple has it all.Sure once you're in, &#34;you*re in&#34;! Some call it &#34;locked in to&#34; even &#34;trapped&#34;....well fine.Until anyone else will bring it all together I see no need to look elsewhere for a bigger screen only, faster CPU, only, more MegaPix only etc, etc and to have it &#34;open&#34;.Last but not the least, the Apple gadgets whatever they are simply look stylish, design cool & sleek in all ends.!###It did not come with a cable, no big deal I just bought a new one. iPad is in great shape and does what I need it to do. 4 stars!###My iPad mini is a fully capable iPad; it's just smaller. That makes it more portable. I'm still looking for the perfect planner app to complete my intended usage, but I'm confident I'll find it eventually.!###The best invention yet.  We love it in my family  I bought another one so we can share more in my family.!###For me it is the best size. My iPhone is sometimes too small and the original iPad is a litte large. The screen is very clear and easy to read.!###I have had my iPad mini since day one. It's the white 16 gig wi-fi version. The screen quality is perfect. The size is perfect. The speed is amazing! I do not think you will find a product like this anywhere but Apple. And for the $329.00 I paid, it has SIRI, stereo speakers, microphone and FaceTime for the best video chat in the industry. A steal at the price and despite Amazon brushing the product aside because they sell readers, this is the best of the best. This time Amazon may not be the best place to but this product. Compition makes it underwhelming until you get to the reviews! Get one from Apple or wherever and you will not look back!!###It's everything I wanted it to be.  I have an older iPad and knew what to expect.  I just wanted the smaller size.!###I got regular iPAD. But got this anyway, thinking it is more convenient to carry ti around. not disappointed. thanks Apple.!###I would recommend this mini ipad to everyone! I gave it as a graduation present to my son and he absolutely loved it !!###I want to start off by saying I usually despise Apple products, mostly because Android offers more for me (like the Amazon AppStore with its Free Paid App of the Day) and is less plain and boring. But I opted to buy an iPad Mini because it was on sale at Walmart for $299. I was going to get the Nexus 7 for $249 but thought for my money the iPad Mini was faster, had a better display and can do virtually everything I'd want or need it to (sans the Amazon AppStore). And I believe I was right.The iPad Mini is the perfect size, being not long and skinny and not perfectly square. It's not too tiny and not overly large. It looks like a giant Galaxy Note II running iOS 6.  It is stick and snappy, loads and plays videos spectacularly, takes great pictures and has a lot of good free and paid for apps that will suit anyone who wants a tablet to play with or do business with.Coming from a Nook Tablet (non-HD) I can say I'm very impressed with this one; how it looks, how it feels and how it performs.  It can do all my Nook Tablet does, and more,  I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase.!###Great apple product, amazing clarity and easy to use. Fully meets my expectations in every way.I would recommend this product to anyone interested in getting one.!###I have been wanting one for the longest time and always thought the regular iPad was a but large. This came out and I was like &#34;woah&#34;. I am SO SO happy about my purchase, if you want one...GET the Mini...AWESOME!!###Love this size! Amazing product. I did fine that my USB cable has already came loose on one end which makes me sad after what I paid. I would recommend a case that when you are using your pad has a handle on the back. Makes it so much easier to use.!###This  was to replace my iPad 2, I absolutely love the light weight and the clarity of the picture on it.!###After hours of tablet research, It came down to quality and price, and this product ended up being chosen, but it should have been a no-brainer. It is the perfect size for anyone. Whether you use it for reading, gaming, business, school, or personal use, this is easily the best tablet you can purchase under $400. I wouldn't recommend anything else.!###Very nice!  Small yet gets the job done,  it shipped quick and secure with no problems. I love it.  4g works great as well.!###I have a 4th generation Ipod Touch 64gb and an Ipad2 16gb.When the ipad mini was announced, I wasn't impressed.  I was fully satisfied w/ my ipad2. Only thing that was making me consider getting the mini was its portability.  With the ipad2, you have to have it in a case, plus a bag if you don't want to accidentally drop it...plus setting it up, etc...Well, I ordered the mini last week and I haven't been able to put it down!!  I absolutely love this thing!Unexpected surprises...- the weight...it feels like you're holding a piece of cardboard...it's light.- the speakers...they're loud & it doesn't matter whether u place it on its front or back, u can hear them perfectly...and u get stereo speakers that sound soooo much better than my ipad2 and louder, clearer, etc...  I've been listening to music on this way more than on my ipad2...- the cameras...front and back...they are a very nice upgrade and the back camera is nice b/c it doesn't matter whether u take a pic, light or dark, it comes out nicely lighted and clear...  isight camera must use every available slither of light to give u a decent pic in just about any bad lighting situation, which is unexpected coming from a tablet.-typing...for some reason, it seems soooo natural to type on the mini... it's a one and a halfer by its size, but it feel effortless-screen resolution...after reading endless reviews about the mini NOT having a retina display, I almost didn't buy it...BUT I love this screen...it is tight, crisp, and I have no problems reading...in fact, the videos that I watch on here are INCREDIBLE... so, for those of you on the fence about the screen resolution, it's a non-issue as far as I'm concerned...don't cheat yourself, like I almost did...I've been watching videos and finishing them in one sitting...that's how nice the screen is...I see things I didn't notice on my ipad2Sadly, I haven't had the desire to pick up my ipad2 since I got the mini... I will have this thing for a very long time... Oh, and if you decide to get one, get 32gb or 64gb...I have the 64gb and I absolutely love it!!!!###This is everything I wanted and more. I love it! It is small enough to carry with me but big enough to surf the net without difficulty!!###It has worked just like I was told it would! Thanks you and please continue to supply good products for us.!###No problems, so nice, the sending ok, iPad in the best conditions, secure, seved, I recommended, this new iPad is really so great!###Great size for me - preferred it over the regular iPad size - it fits in my purse so well, so that I feel comfortable taking it anywhere with me!

The size is perfect.  very good graphics and storage!###Connection speed slow, and the auto correct spellings is a pain,other wise I like it,it came  in good conditionl I would buy nother!###I brought this mini for my wife and she just loves it. It's a great size and weight...I would recommend others to invest.!###The best facebook and email product.. 1000s of apps that work, easy to use and did I say everything works right out of the box.!###Excelente el detalle es las aplicaciones de edici&oacute;n de texto que se bajaron de la Apple aunque se compraron adi&oacute;s hacen perder luego de la edici&oacute;n texto complejos por ejemplo cuando se editan documentos con pie de p&aacute;ginas este se pierden al grabar el archivo.!###The form factor of the ipad mini is great. I owned the ipad 2 but I sold it so that I could get the ipad mini; best decision I've ever made. It just feels right in your hand, and even though the screen isn't retina it is noticeably better than the ipad 2. The wifi is also better than the ipad 2. This is by far the best ipad yet.!###In hunting for MP3 players for personal use,  it seemed like most were over priced for what you get.  I have an iPad with retina display for work, and used and iPod touch before that to  take  to conferences.  For home I wanted something with a big enough screen to watch movies  while traveling, and the usage of apps is seamless among Apple devices.  For now, it is probably  the best device in its class on the market today,  in my opinion, but the price is still more than its competitors.  Apple should be able to make this with a retina display, and get more storage on iPads in general, then they would really be able to  fill a niche between laptops and hand held devices.!###Everything I expected!! Love the mini! Arrived just in time for my birthday gift for myself! Five stars for sure!!###I bought this on a whim and because i was giving a cash Amazon gift.  I love my ipad mini, i didn't realize how much i would use it.  Great purchase and super fast delivery.!###I gave my husband my ipad2 which was just too bulky but the ipad mini is a perfect fit even with my Surviver case (similar to but better than otterbox).  I can carry a normal sized purse instead of a huge one. Best product ever! Love it!!###I was hesitant about purchasing the iPad Mini due to it being a smaller iPad 2 (spec wise) and the lack of the retina display.  However I was in need of a tablet after getting rid of my older iPad (due to size).  And after considering the other options in the same size range I picked this one up due to having so much money invested on apps and other iTunes goodies.  I didn't want to repurchase the same apps, or similar apps, again on another store.The size is perfect.  I have never owned a retina display device but have seen one and really wish that this had it, however it wasn't a deal breaker for me.  Speed wise, I have not had an issue.  I own an iPhone 4s and it is on par with it.  I don't do heavy gaming.  Mostly work productivity and reading, as well as the occasional Netflix/Hulu.The only thing I want people to beware is that many sellers are increasing the price of the iPad Mini and I wanted to warn consumers to not waste there money.  Apple and other websites sell the iPad Mini at MSRP ($329 for the 16 GB WiFi only model) and free shipping.  I can't imagine why other places are selling it for $70-100 more and charging for shipping.!###I have the regular iPad, but my wife wanted something she could carry with her more easily. She loves the Mini.  Mainly used with the kindle app for reading, and it's great.!###our son uses this for middle school assignments.  Alot of kids do these days (yikes).  He likes the extra gb and it's very handy both for school and for travel (he is on travel sports teams).  He loves it.!###I used to think that the iPad was better than the iPad mini but I was wrong. This device, even though it's small,  can do everything a computer can do. It has bright colors and the graphics are really nice so when my brother is playing minecraft , the screen is super clear and the buttons are easy to use {unlike a real phone it is hard to text}. When I listen to itunes or Pandora, the music sounds super clear without the headphones{unlike the iPod}. Also the iPad mini is super light so I can hold it in one hand and my hand won't get tired. When I study for tests and exams, I use siri/notes and when I talk on notes what ever I say  goes on the paper. It makes it easier to study. This device has great memory and loads super fast so if you buy a game or music it takes only takes a few seconds to load. There are  small things that I don't like about my iPad mini. When I am using the internet or Google, I can barely see the print. Also, it is complicated to set up Imesseges if you don't have great reception. Overall this is a great device and I highly recommend.- Olivia!###I brought the Verizon version for its hardware. I read the Verizon version will work on other carriers but the same is NOT true of the ATT - so for me its was protecting the resale value.Love the LTE speed.I got the 32 Gb version since the 16 is way to low for me for the books and magazines I read.In a pinch I can use the tethering feature on it if my cable goes out and I dont think verizon cares - as long as I dont suddenly spike on my data usage.  The same cant be said of ATT.The ipad itself is so much easier to handle.  Its sooo much lighter than the regular iPad. after using it I cant get over how heavy the 10 inch one is.I also had a regular sized 32Gb iPad 3 w/ RD. and sold it to get the asus transformer prime. I got it since it had one feature I wanted, the expandable memory. I loved the Prime at first but it was glitchy and got slower over time.  But it was never quite as smooth as polished as iOS. I guess google needs to work on improving their "photocopier".I started using my wife's iPad one day and just kept using it since it was so much smoother and it never froze up like the prime.I decide to get a mini since it had just come out and it was cheaper. I got the 32 Gb LTE version for a little more than the base regular wi-fi only ipad with 16 Gb.The non-retina display is not a big deal for me even though I had a iPad 3 and a iphone 4 (replaced w/ a 5). The resolution IS better than a non-retina display iPad but not as good as the ipad 4 w/ RD. Bottom line its good enough to watch movies and view pictures or magazines on.The mini with LTE is the perfect size for using as a gps in the car.  Its way bigger than almost all gps provided in any car right now. Plus it doesnt cost +$2K like it does as an option on a car.Its also the perfect size to use to control my TV as a remote for Apple TV, Comcast (although I have the wrong cable box right now), ...Cons: The only down side thats important to me was the lack of expandable memory. But I did find a fix for that.  I use a Seagate GoFlex Satellite Mobile Wireless Storage 500 GB USB 3.0 External Hard Drive STBF500101 Black. It lets me stream wirelessly up to 500 Gb of movies, music or whatever to my ipad.  It even works if I dont have a wi-fi signal since it generates its own signal.  And upto 3 devices can watch 3 different movies at the same time. pretty cool.!###This device was in real good shape and the kids love it.  This is just the right size for viewing.  Easy to carry with you when goin gto places.!###Just your regular ipad mini.  came new. works like new. I was pleased with the service with this product. I might buy some more!###I have an Apple iphone so I wanted the Apple Mini Pad.

We love it!!###This is my first time to have an ipad mini, I came on time. It's handy and easily to place on your bag. It's great!!###i bought this as a gift for my son for christmas and he loved it. he is still getting much pleasure from his ipad mini.!###Very good product for everyone..I'm glad I got it for me and one for her.I can't wait til the new one comes out!###I purchased one of these for my wife as a Christmas gift.  She has enjoyed an ipod touch for several years so this was a super nice upgrade.  Very sleek, smart and easy to navigate.  Very nice product.!###I love this product! I have gifted this to my sister and she is liking it a lot.It is very light in weight and the clarity is fabulous.!###I love my mini iPad. It was the best purchase of 2012. It came before the estimated arrival date which was a nice surprise. I would definitely purchase again from this seller.!###Is beautiful in black, practical size, and have all the same features ofa normal ipad.Easy to carry with her, and transport every where.Excellent choice.!###This is the first time I have owned an I pad so I cannot compare it against others ipads I chose the mini due to size ... I love it I never turn my computer on anymore. I did purchase it on amazon but waited until I got it for what I would paid through apple. Does everything I want. I purchased the first kindle fire and was disappointed in the apps I do on Line banking did not have my bank  App. And many others that were not available . So it know belongs to my 6 year old granddaughter .. Spend the extra money get the iPad mini.. Ask yourself what you need it do. Do your research and find what works for you.!###I purchased this item as a gift and it was perfect. A great product between the iPod and iPad, perfect picture, perfect size, and again, a perfect product.!###I like the iPad Mini so much that I sold my first iPad to a relative, and now he's enthralled with it. I have had the first iPad since it came out, but the Mini does everything the full size does and more. It has a very good camera and it has Siri. Siri doesn't amount to much for travel, because you have to be connected to the internet to use it, but it's a nice feature at home or at a hotspot. And best of all, it only weights about the same as a large paperback book.!###I had an iPad 2, but I didn't use it much. I loved it mainly because I could download all these wonderful syntheziers, and music applications. I would occassionally use it at a restaurant when eating dinner, or while waiting at the DMV or soemthing like that. Sometimes it came in handy at home if I didn't want to turn on my computer and watch youtube videos. But this is not an iPad 2 review, sorry. But I was not using that much because it was heavy, and bulky. I would put it in my backpack, and after awhile that would get old. So I wanted to get this smaller tablet, which is really what I wanted to begin with.Immediately after trying it, I realised I had made a good move of selling my iPad 2. It was a joy to use, and I found myself enjoying configuring it, and downloading apps just like the old days when I would configure my old computers. I have at least tripled the amount of time using it, because it's so handy.Now there are some slight compatibility issues with apps designed for iPad. Mainly they have to do with not being able to read the really fine print on some of the synthesizer apps. Once I figure out what those virtual knobs and buttons are for it's not a problem. Sometimes it will be difficult to tap on a really small button. Hopefully developers will quickly adopt and come up with iPad mini optimized apps, but that's not really a big deal, I just need glasses, and a stylus. I think it would be a good idea for Apple to sell a stylus with it at a discount to make up for this slight inconvenience.The display looks nicer, because I believe it's more pixels per square inch, so scrunching all those images down makes it look like a high end 7" tablet. Also I'm glad they made it this size, that's well thought out. If it were a smaller 7" tablet it would be too difficult to use. At 7.8 inches or so it's perfect. I would not recommend everyone going out and selling your iPad 2 to get this, but if you don't have an iPad yet, and are looking for something more affordable, or more compact than an iPad 2, or iPad 3 etc, then this is a great option to have. I'm not sure how many of these have sold, but I would not be surprised if it were a hit, and a retina version came out. As far as improvements that they could make, I am mainly interested in a faster CPU, and a MicroSD slot.  Also, I had some accessories like the Line 6 Mobilekeys 25 keyboard that used the old 30 pin cord. So I will have to buy an adapter. That is one thing that kind of bothers me about Apple is hidden costs like that. But I love it!!###I already knew ipad, but this is the first time I have an ipad mini.  I love it's size and weight!  Just love it...!!###I am a gadget junkie.  I buy and sell my gadgets all the time.  This tablet will be one I hold onto for a long time.  The screen is a perfect size, the size is so light and portable, the camera is great  and while I absolutely loved my ipad2, this one is even better.!###You will never regret buying this item.it is a tool  used in different aspects of our daily life. No regret.!###Just as powerful as an ipad, but lighter and easier to carry around.  Its not the same multimedia experience because the screen is smaller, but its an awesome gadget.!###I think this ipad is ways better than the previous ones. Yet, i do not find it as fast as a laptop. I need to restart it to make it function better. I have to say that I did not add the verizon option, yet because I am using it with available wi-fi I have at home. But overall, it has many applications that I need for myself and my baby. He loves to see some programs for a few minutes daily. I would say 5-10 mn. I do recommend it for anyone who needs a tablet to facilitate reading and writing on your pdfs. It will not replace the printed book, but it helps a lot to have that boost to keep it going in a pleasant way.  It is just fabulous!!###Works great ,easier to carry than a laptop. Just what I needed for traveling. Easier to read than my iphone!###Very happy with the product purchased for my hubby.  He is learning to use it.  Very user friendly for some who isn't computer savvy.!###I just picked this up and I have been very pleased with it. Other then the normal stuff this thing can do, I can administer my Windows, Mac, and Linux machines all from this iPad. SSH, RDP, Apple Remote Desktop, etc. It pretty much replaces my laptop and it will be even better when I get my SHARKK Apple iPad Mini Keyboard Bluetooth Case Cover Stand. I was a little concerned at first about not having a Retina display, but it looks great to me and if non-Retina keeps the cost down, then why pay extra for what I don't need. I also like that all my premium paid for iPhone apps transferred over to my iPad Mini. I was on the fence about the cellular model that also has the GPS, but I didn't like the price difference. I decided its cheaper to just buy a Dual Electronics external Bluetooth GPS receiver.!###though nowhere near as open as my nexus 7, i really like the ipad mini, plus the apps with the apple store. I love the size and feel. Great product!###Fast. Stable. Easy to use. I could not have made a better choice for a tablet.  Use it and the nexus 7 before you choose the screen scale that suits you most.!###I love my mini me. I carry it everywhere with me. Listen to music, movies, I read all the time. I still love my kindle fire and my kindle paper white. This however has great apps for all different things. Fits into my satchel, cross-body bag, back pack, my favorite companion on trips.!###iPad Mini is an excellent Apple product, is more portable than regular iPad so you can carry it with you almost everywhere. Very light and comfortable for reading books and other docs, you can easily edit or create new things using it, as so for making notes. The only limitation would be not having a SIM card adapter, so you must have wi-fi to use everything at 100%.!###Of course I love the Apple iPad Mini.  It goes everywhere I go, does everything and is especially terrific for travel.!###It is the solution that apple need it  The size is what finished to motivate to buy it. It is so compact to carry anywhere.!###Got this as a push presy for the wifey who's preggers .. she loves it so much that i can now watch Speedvision uninterrupted WooHoo !!Great size.. not too big..not too small. if that's what you're worried about..dont.. the original iPad should have been this size.. wayy better.!###I was a bit scared about not ordering from the apple website but this is the way to go. I got a brand new ipad mini and with the money is saved was able to buy a case and screen protector .!###It is a fun thing to have. I like the camera. I went from  a desktop to a tablet, so there is a little bit of a learning curve, but it has been an easy transition. Looking forward to learning more.!###It is very portable and not hauling my laptop everywhere is a nice relief.Did not have any problems with it and did not experience it being used by someone else.It was brand new!!###Same excellent camera as iPad3. Superior 4:3 screen ratio. Half the weight of iPad3. The 163 pixels per inch is well suited for this device. If you have difficulties reading small text on labels then you will love the camera. Take a close up photo of the label and then read the fine print without difficulties on the screen. Like a magnifier glass but better. Negatives: -will not charge from a regular 0.5 amps laptop USB port. -almost too big to be carried in pants pocket. Summary: way more practical for taking photos than iPad3 because of smaller size and weight. Much easier to read emails and attachments compared to iPhone and iPod. I'm glad I got this one for $299+tax at big W.!###I like to read and Ipad mini is perfect for me.I've been waiting for one with Retina displa though but couldn't wait any longer.It's incredibly light and it fits my hand just fine tough i was a little bit disappointed with smart cover: it adds substantional weigh to ipad!###The iPad mini is the best because don't sacrifice anything and has a more managleable size. It is a success..!!I will recomend it to everybody.!###I bought this item b/c I didn't want to deal with the delay of apple. When I got it I immediately started using it and as expected it is a great addition to my apple product family. If you ate in the hunt for a great tablet this is the way to go and the retailer offered great service.!###Hours of enjoyment! Great times for anyone, and my man loved it.  A little more expensive than purchasing it from the store, but the convenience of not having to find a parking space and deal with crowds was well worth it.!###This is the review of my 12 yr. old daughter. I edited it a bit:  First of all I would like to thank all of those people who wrote the reviews that guided me to find the perfect tablet:) I had changed my mind many a times, first from android then to Apple's iPad 2,etc... But finally, I was sold on an Android. Asus Tf300. It was perfect, it had a big screen, fluid and responsive. It would be perfect for my note taking as a student. It was light, and had a secure rubbery back. Wonderful! But then......  (Insert dramatic Phantom of the Opera piano playing. Horrified gasps! Scream! Get the smelling salts! Faint! Oh no!) Well, here is where my review gets useful, hopefully. My mom suggested that I reconsider the iPad mini. She felt it was the best size for me to be transporting to my classes.  First of all, I bought it direct from Apple with engraving. When we purchased it right before Christmas, Apple seemed to have the lowest price at $329 for the most basic model. I got a white, 16gb iPad mini. I also bought it with the smart cover, which is overly priced. However,it really is ingenious and it folds into a stand that I use while reading an e-book. I absolutely loved the device at first sight! It is fluid, I love the screen etc...! I know I have no experience on Retina anything, but the screen really is pretty good!(but you might notice some pixilation on white screens or when you're reading, but it really doesn't bother me.) I really like reading on it on the NOOK reader/app.(I know some of you like the Kindle. I just got the NOOK app because for Christmas I recieved a $25 Barns&Noble gift card.)Over all, I absolutely love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love it!!!!!!! I am sorry if this did not help you at all.I see you going "wack-o"! Don't deny it.[Mother's note: The screen is large enough to comfortably view/edit photos and videos. The screen is the size of a paper back book page. The photo quality is better than expected. It feels and looks like a high quality product. Our elderly,yet hip, neighbor is so impressed, she's going to buy one instead of getting a laptop. If you have an iPhone you will easily know how to opperate this device. My daughter uses my iTunes account so I easily keep track of her purchases. I get an immediate e-mail notice.]!###The packaging was fantastic. No damages. The iPad itself is a super iOS device apple to have released. Delivery time was excellent.I will recommend all business workers and presenters to go for it, as it is light and fits very well on your palm.!###Received this as a Christmas present. At first I was a little weary because I thought that the iPad Mini would pale in comparison due to the retina display. How do I feel about the iPad Mini? Let's just say I never come on here to write reviews, and I couldn't resist reviewing this product.It is absolutely fantastic. The size is PERFECT. I wouldn't want the larger retina iPad, this is so portable and easy to carry around-it's as light as a feather. It is super fast, super easy to set up (you literally turn it on, Apple walks you through an extremely brief, simple set up, and are ready to go) and then are free to use it for whatever your purpose. I let some of my family play around with it and they each had their own preferences! Some liked to take pictures, others liked to watch YouTube videos in gorgeous HD, and others liked downloading games. I may never play a game on my iPhone again--the screen on this is stunning.Apps open almost instantly, and there is never a lag. I highly recommend this product to anyone. Forget Android tablets, go with Apple. You won't be disappointed.!###>&lt;>&lt;>&lt;>&#12336; Original Review Written December 26, 2012 &#12336;&lt;>&lt;>&lt;>&lt;The only Apple product I own is an iPhone 4 but I've been using iPhones for almost 5 years & love it still.I liked the idea of the iPad at first but tried a few friends iPads out and really didn't see a need for a huge version of my iPhone ....and that's what it felt like,, well actually, more like a HEAVIER, BULKIER, and WAY MORE expensive version of my iphone....so I passed and didn't think more of it,It became super popular of course ,,,,but I didn't really want it much. My IPhone was enough.A few more years, along with a few more iPad versions go buy & THEN......there was the mini!!!I was intreguied and found this new version something I possibly see myself enjoying. I loved my iPhone and had lots of apps that kept me from ever being bored but every once in awhile I wished the screen was bigger....like when drawing in an art app and such....Unfortunately the iPad was only one BIG size and more than I needed or wanted.The mini was perfect!! Just a little bigger than my iPhone making most apps the perfect size to see great & enjoy playing or working more but still small enough to comfortably take anywhere. OHHH and the WEIGHT!!! SOOOOOO much lighter than iPad. Plus I've been playing with it for awhile now and love everything about it.I got the White 64gb Wifi only iPad Mini and now I need a stylus. Anyone know which is good?My first & only iPad and I'm extremely happy. I just wish I could control my app buying/testing since I'm using a lot of space and there is no larger storage than the 64mb but I'm so thankful I got this size! LoL______________________________________________________________________________>&lt;>&lt;>&lt;>~~ U P D A T E Jan. 9, 2014 ~~&lt;>&lt;>&lt;>&lt; PROBLEM with tablet______________________________________________________________________________A few months ago my beloved iPad Mini started acting up and will no longer work unless plugged into the wall for power. It will be charged and say 100% on battery but as soon as the plug is removed, the battery icon shows that its in the RED on the lock screen and needs to be charged. I've tried every solution available on Internet and this "problem" conveniently began the minute it's 1 year warranty expired. So I have no idea what else to do except use it only while I'm near an outlet to keep it connected to which completely changes the portability aspect of the device.Ive had a few different iPhones and iPod Touches over the years with no major troubles so when I finally decided to join the iPad craze, I had nothing but positive thoughts from my own experiences and from friends who have been using them. I was wrong! Needless to say, I was/AM disappointed and the fact that its my FIRST and ONLY iPad is not helping the situation AT ALL!I'm outta luck though......I can't afford to purchase a new one and I can't sell this one in this condition. I've run outta solutions to try,,, so for now I'm just thankful that it works at all (hope it continues!) and just keep it plugged in to use it.I'll continue to search the web for others dealing with same issue and hopefully someone, somewhere, will have a solution out there for me that works. :::crossing my fingers:::::I expected more than a year out of this device (especially for the price!). I can honestly say, I took extremely great care of this iPad as I do with everything I own. I'm always careful with electronics especially but this particular tablet was specifically meant to only use at home, for quiet leisure days and at bedtime. I never even took it out of my house. It sat on my table or wherever until I was ready to use it (mainly bedtime). So I can only guess it was already defective when I got it.Anyway, just thought I'd post here in case anyone else has this problem or wonders if anyone has/had this problem.!###I was reluctant to get one at first. I already had an iPad 2 (2nd generation) and the specks didn't seem all that great compared to the newer iPads. However, I like the idea of the size because I love playing games and reading books on mine. So I got one and it did not disappoint. I'm really glad I got the smaller one. It's so light. It feels just a little heavier than my iPhone 4. I can read for a long time with it in my hands without getting tired. I can play games and the graphics are stunning. The battery is really good. I can still use the iPad for an hour or more even when it's at 15%. I use it all day without needing a recharge. What I liked about my larger iPad is that it was like a laptop. I could write my screenplays on it. The keypad on the mini is of course smaller, which makes it hard to type on. However, with the dictation feature I haven't been writing a whole lot. I really love that feature and comes in handy if you don't want to type on such a small device. I also use a wireless keyboard. Lastly, there isn't a lot of space on the sides of the device to hold it without touching the screen. It's still very light so I can grip the device in one hand which I like better.Basically the iPad mini has all the features of a regular iPad. It's a matter of what size you want to get. If you like reading, playing games and want something lighter then this is the perfect fit for you.!###THE APPLE IPAD MINI IS ANOTHER AWESOME PRODUCT FROM APPLE. I LOVE THE FACETIME FEATURE AND SIRI. MUCH BETTER THAN THE KINDLE FIRE.!###My mother is going to love this! I got in for mothers day, came right on time and I'm super happy with the ipad mini.!###Love my ipad mini! It is the perfect portable size! Product works great and is just as described! Way better than the kindle!!###nice, I like it very much! Lack of earphones, not perfect. Maybe, next time, earphone and ipad can be sold together.!###I love the Ipad mini! I am not technologically advanced at all, but this has already won my heart! I never wanted anything apple until after grad school, just as a reward for hard work. Luckily, A few peers and I are studying abroad and the professors recommended this product or a kindle. Thus, my apple award came sooner than I would have thought. ENJOY!!###For the supplier, the delivery was fast and great quality. And the product: I just love my IPAD, the older models are way too big, but this one is easy to carry in college, at work, etc. I would recommend anyone to buy apple products.!###Item received in good condition.  Working without any problems.  I've used the Ipad for years and wished to try out the Ipad Mini.  Now I have one and I love it.!###I really like how compact it is. would recommend to others who are looknig for a compact version of the ipad!###I like the size and the fact that it is an apple product.  Easy to carry and manage.  Best Buy!!!!###I am a big apple fan, iphone, appleTV and now the ipad mini is perfect size!  I gave my daughter my Samsung Galaxy and she bout me this one...Love it!!###My I-pod was losing battery strength, so I bought this as a replacement.  My old eyes thank me.  It does everything my little i-pod did, plus, it has Siri and I can now get away with saying a lot of things to it that I used to have to type on that tiny screen.  So, it's all good.!###I purchased it for as a gift for my little cousin and he hasn't put it down yet. It's fast and easy to use.!###Love the size and everything. Its comfortable to handle! Happy costumer here! Want to take it everywhere i go! Addicted!!###This is my first official Apple product (I have had iPods in the past, but I don't count those)and I *love* it. I had a few hiccups setting it up (mostly around downloading songs to my device through iCloud & iMatch- I blame the apps- and around updating my NY Times e-reader subscription to a tablet one) but I think that is mostly on me for being new to OS and for being REALLY impatient when it came to using my new mini.But, it is day 2 and I am happy as a clam.1. This device is very light, very mobile and really aesthetically pleasing. It fits easily in my purse and is literally the opposite of clunky. Even with my festive patterned case.2. The battery life is impressive. I have been listening to music all day (and playing with new apps while at work) and I didn't need to plug it in until the end of the day.3. The screen is bright & crisp, it isn't a retina screen (really nothing is) and going from other devices to this is different an upgrade.4. The interface is beautiful and is mostly intuitive.5. The experience is just so pretty . I *almost* opted for an iPhone over the Samsung Galaxy Note because I was so impressed with my mini.I haven't really found any cons with the device yet, I will keep y'all updated. . . . . . it did take FOREVER to add some of my songs to iMatch and then to download them to my device (only to delete the ones that weren't checked). That process was a bit painful- I almost returned this for a 16 gb with cellular but it is all good now.And I purchased this at the Apple Store. It was cheaper, but this model was a little hard to come by. They were out of it at one store and I had to go to another store the following day. I think that the black is popular and I think that 32 gb is the sweet spot.!###with not expecting much from this device i was pleasantly surprised how handy it feels and functions and this i feel is the right size for a tablet. i do own a Samsung galaxy note  2 (10.1) and though i absolutely love it  and would always be my first preference.Primarily i bought this for my son who i didn't want to mess up my galaxy note 2this i feel is more handier when it comes to traveling as it very light and display aint that bad as most would want you to believe, it has rich display and all the features of a traditional ipad and has one of the faster Bluetooth connections.Only gripe is unlike android where you can kill process to free up space in this there are no apps to do that for u but you have to press the home button continuously till you see your apps as a row on the bottom and touch each of them till they wiggle with a minus sign on them click them one by one to close em.those who travel a lot and want all the features of an i pad in compact ( the screen is wide enough the borders are thinner) this is smart design, i would suggest buying this instead of the bulkier(in size) ipads or other brand tablets.If you are a girl this would easily fit in your handbag or even a medium sized purse.I bought the black 32gb wi fi only version (dont ever buy the 16 gb one) since there is no option to increase the storage capacity by inserting a higher capacity memory card go for the medium one as the bare minimum as space quickly will run out if you store digital movies videos mp3s pictures and download apps, 32 gb gives you enough space to have spare  space left over( in my case i have 10 movies, 15 music videos, 120 mp3 songs and around 20 apps and im using only 33% of space.its delicate so strongly suggest a cover that covers the corners as well the cover i bought was sold by bear motion genuine leather.!###Ok, I'm a fan.  I waited until the Mini 2 was released before I bought it.  Just got the simplest, 16 GB wi-fi only version, and as a Mac head since 1998, why wouldn't I love this?Still have to learn about the whole Cloud thing; but yeah, very cool gadget to have.!###I had the full sized ipad and when the mini came out my husband bought it for me.  It's size is much more portable.  I can throw it in my purse. It's lighter which makes it easier to hold with arthritic hands.!###With all the ultra skinny notebook computers, the size of a full sized iPad isn't as portable as it was 4 years ago, but this mini iPad is the perfect size!  As a big reader, the iPad mini is the best option... You have access to the nook, kindle, and googlebook libraries as well as the huge iBook catalog.  No retina display, but not a big deal unless you are doing a lot with pics or intensive graphics games.!###Loved mine so much I bought my mother a Wifi only version. She loves it and uses it more than either of us expected.!###What more can be said about Apple - I'm not an &#34;Apple Snob&#34; but have to say that their small devices - iPod, iPhone, iPad - cannot be beat.  Navigating, app library, organizing - much easier for me on an Apple product than an Android and I've used both.  That being said - there are others who are committed Android users and I'd recommend reading their reviews of those products before deciding. Bon chance!!###The merchandise was brand new. I love it. Apple is a very good product. The only thing is that it comes with no fdirections!###These days Apple is losing the excitement factor over the Android phones and tablets that are fancier and come in enough shapes and sizes to suit your taste. I, myself, have tried the Android phones and tablets but have come back to Apple for two main reasons: Consistency and Quality,I have always wanted an iPad but the cumbersome and awkward size was always the turn off to me. I wanted something easy to carry and put away; the iPad just seemed a bit too large. I eventually gave in to an Android tablet and Enjoyed it to an extent but it became clunky and cluttered. The quality felt a bit too plasticky as well.Then Apple announced the iPad Mini and I was ready to give it a try. THIS DEVICE ROCKS! I cannot say enough good things about it; it's the quality hardware and software Apple is known for. I can always count on my iPad Mini to work and do so like it did the first time, never slowing down.So... If you are in the market for a small tablet and don't mind paying the premium I highly recommend the iPad Mini. Sure, it's a bit more expensive but if you have it know you are paying for a slick device that won't turn into a frustrating paper weight next year. :)!###Would be a very useful note to this product: Wi-Fi model have no gps module.Anyway it is excellent thing :)!###I bought the original Kindle Fire when it was first released. I was so excited to get it, I pre-ordered in advance so I could have release day delivery. And for the next several months, I loved it. The screen was beautiful. However I had a few scares with it.The first issue I had with the Kindle was on a few occasions, it just didn't turn on. After discovering how to do a hard-reset, I was able to get it back up and running, and just did this whenever it wouldn't turn on again. Then one day while I was playing music on it via the iHeartRadio application, it started to overheat (wasn't aware that the Kindle even could overheat) and after the music that was playing started skipping, it froze up. I picked it up and found the back near the battery hot to the touch. It would not turn off, so I did a hard reset (as suggested by Amazon). After that, it never turned back on. Thankfully, Amazon quickly replaced my Kindle Fire (for free) and when I received my new one, everything was back to normal. However by this time, I had gotten my first iPhone (4s). I was surprised how much faster the internet browser and applications ran on my small phone, compared to the Kindle Fire. So I ended up using my iPhone more often than my Kindle.On month after Amazon replaced my 1st generation Kindle Fire, they released the new line of Kindles. I almost ordered one of the new HD ones, but decided to wait and see how the reviews compared to this iPad mini, which was released around the same time.Now months later, I'm hearing reports from people who did order the new Kindle Fire HD that they too are running into problems here and there with this new version. After doing a lot of research, I discovered that statistically, Apple products have fewer claims for warranty work than other brands. I'm by no means an Apple-Fangirl, and prefer to use Windows PC's in my own home. But I hate having my brand new items break down, even if they are covered by a warranty. When I spend hundreds on something, I just want it to work, and would rather never need to know how how good a warranty is or not. So the statistics of the Apple products having better reliability was the deciding factor.When comparing the Kindle Fire to the iPad mini, I will say that Kindle (especially the new ones) have a more vivid screen. The Kindle screens are beautiful and the colors are amazing. However that's where the majority of the advantages over the Mini ended for me. The iPad mini has nice web browser, the applications work well (less crashing issues), the wireless connection is fast and I didn't have any sort of lag between turning on my Mini and getting online, like I often did with my Kindle. The mini has been everything I hoped it would be, and I love the size.The iPad mini is super thin. So thin, I actually worry at times it's too slim. It's such a nice piece of hardware, I tend to worry that the ultra slim design might make it too delicate. Thankfully, they make cases like the OtterBox Defender Series Hybrid Case for iPad Mini for people like myself who want to put the delicate Mini into a super duty case. I'm glad I did, since it's taken a tumble or two in the last month I've owned it, and inside the case it stays unharmed.I do love the small size of the Mini. I needed something smaller than the large iPad, but also needed something larger than my iPhone. Something that would fit into my handbag, but that I could also easily read, check and reply to my email on. The screen is very responsive and the speakers produce nice sound, better than the iPhone's. The Mini is perfect for me, and I'm so glad decided on it. Everything works just as well or better than I had hopped for, and I've passed my Kindle Fire down to my pre-teen daughter, who loves it.!###Talk about Apple products is to talk about excellence, innovation, design, simplicity, utility. It's a very nice portable device you must have.!###small, light and good-looking,also very useful!White is much better.I use it to read books and surf internet, and also play games.!###I bought it as gift for my son and he loves it. Its very nice .  WE would recommend to anyone!###I have two grown sons.  I bought one mini ipad for one son, and purchased the great case for it too, but couldn't find another one near Christmas for the other son.  I was getting a bit concerned.  I had to click on this product a couple times to get the right one, BUT it was SO WORTH IT.  I received it prompty, and was so happy to have been able to present both sons with the product.  They love this.!###It was the best computer tablet I ever had because I am starting to like it a lot even apple.!###Can't believe I paid this much for a mini when they are now $299. But, I wanted it when it was new, hot, and sold out everywhere. I paid, they delivered quickly.!###I bought this for my wife who always wanted to use my IPad3.  This has been a great addition and meets the needs for her and the apps that she uses.  In the evening I can now use my IPad.!###Bought it to my kids ,very usable , easy to use - GREAT ,function and real fun.apple are doing it again...!###I recently tried for an extended time a iPAD mini. The design is wonderful. I have used several tablets and smartphones. My dream is to have an Android OS on a ipad Mini industrial design. It is lightweight and a pleasure to hold on.* Good - 7.9&#8209;inch (diagonal) LED-backlit Multi&#8209;Touchdisplay with IPS technology* Bad - 1024-by-768 resolution at 163 pixels per inch (ppi) NEED retina display! Apple, introduce it in next version* Good -  Fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating* Bad - GPS only on Cellular models* Bad - Nano SIMS are non standard* Good - Apps are great look and feel - The NAVIGON apps works only cellular* Good - itunes University is great* Bad - itunes interface is not that god still, confusing* Good - Physical design is unbeatable* Good - Kids will love them, lot of buttery smooth apps* Bad - No back button, So used to them in Android it is just great* Bad - physical button* Good - Lightweight!!###Happy with my IPad  with the multiples of uses it provides worth every penny I spent on my tax refund!###Love this device. The screen is so clear and so much bigger than my iPhone! Really easy to use. Can't live without it.!###I've used iOS devices for several years, and the Mini is by far the best. Better, IMO than the full sized iPad. More useful and more flexible. And unlike Android tablets, iOS devices work brilliantly for music processing apps, like guitar amps and synth apps.!###I really love this mini iPad. I don't have any other tablets so maybe they would all seen just as fun but it is so speedy, easy to use. I do have a mac book pro so the OS is familiar to me.!###After owning a iPad original I decided to finally upgrade.  I never liked the larger 10.1" platform, just to big and like many NOT one hand friendly, that has changed, oh yes!  After playing with one before buying me and girlfriend decided this is it! We bought 2 and a Apple TV. Best combination ever, really! It's bigger than the basic 7" tablets floating around.  The build quality is second to none, especially the android tablets.  Performance is great! If on the fence, get off it and click buy now, seriously, it's all that and a bag of chips.  I have not taken laptop out since my original sync, no need, their is about a app for everything, of course the best Apps cost money, but software cost on computers as well.  Great product worthy of your hard earned money, will change your lunch break forever.!###Perfect size for my needs.  Light, small, yet big enough to amuse one for hours.  It would have been nice if they could have updated the prossesor to be more like the new iPad 3's.  I guess Apple still had plenty of the iPad 2 processors lying around and said, &#34;Oh, we need more money.&#34;  The iPad Mini 2 will probably be a 5 star machine.!###Pretty much the iPad mini is just a bigger version of the iPhone 5 or itouuch. Having both of these devices, I still got the iPad mini and it arrived yesterday. It was a gift from my fianc&eacute; with a free engraving on the back. To my surprise I was not bored. The full screen keyboard makes it easy for me to type and access websites with ease. Way easier and smoother than my other apple devices. Having Siri is a great plus. I was surprised that this feature was included because of the price. Siri understands pretty much everything I say and makes things a lot quicker. If there is a fact that I don't know, she supplies the information within seconds or opens up safari or various apps that can help.All in all I think this a great buy. If you already have the ipad 2 i see no reason to get this though. Don't bother buying that expensive Smart Cover case from apple, there are tons of them on here that are more reasonably priced.!###The size of this iPad mini is just perfect... I don't miss the retina stuff, wich I think got to be great, but I never had anything that has a retina display. Write in this device has now sense. The best feature is the size.!###I received an ipad mini as a gift.  I'm partial to apple products but the price prevents me from buying as many apples as I would like.  This was my first tablet so there was not much to compare from.  To me it feels like a mini MacBook: familiar platform and nuances.  Aesthetics, clarity, user friendliness, and all that apple goodness.  Most of my laptops, desktops, and phones stop functioning after a few years.  I've yet to have an apple device break on me.  Fact is you have to pay more for quality and reliability, lesson learned.  I love listening to music on my ipad mini, the sound quality is outstanding.  Easy access features and sufficient screen size.  Absolutely relish utilizing my mini everyday.!###love itttt best tablet for the price fersure! I would suggest that anyone who wants a tablet that acceptably works to get an ipad.!###Love it very fast shipping . Perfect for me and have wanted one for a long time. The reg iPad too expensive for me but the mini is perfect to take w me!###I have 3 iPads, 1 Kindle fire, 1 Acer Iconia and 1 Kindle. This is my favorite! Well thought out. Beautiful craftsmanship. Works great with iCloud. Very easy to find accessories (covers, adapters, etc.).!###The IPad is a terrific little device. I'm happy that I received it as a gift. Had I not, I would have purchased it myself.!###Great product, Amazon shipping was fast!!!Mi wife and kid love it !!!We have the Ipad 3 and the good thin about the Ipad Mini is that is so light weight and portable.!###I would recommend this item easy to carry around in most purses/ I haven't used the 4g yet, but I like having it for security when I travel...It's fun to have Siri looking things up and finding quick answers to minor situations..I would definitely recommend this product.!###I have the 3rd generation iPad as well. I bought this because the larger iPad is just too big for my needs. I also have a MacBook, so I rarely used the larger iPad.The mini is just right. It's the perfect size and weight for me. It's kinda like Goldilocks. The iPad mini fits into just the right spot between a laptop and a smartphone. You get everything that the larger iPad has, but in a package that is far more convenient and portable.!###disappointing display, little bit better than iPad2. Rather prefer Nexus 7 or kindle fire. Hope apple will get it a retina display for next generation.!###After playing around with it for a few days the only word that comes to mind is perfect. Great product.!###I have been a loyal customer of Apple since the Original Iphone was introduced .. I have made several purchasesof Apple Products that I was not sure if I ever need them.. I guess same applies to this Ipad mini .. I havethe original Ipad , Ipad 2 , Ipad 3 .. I did not jump in on the Ipad mini as soon as it was introduced , howevertook my time to consider .. I was getting a little bit bored by the Ipad 3 since it was difficult to use in bed ,space was too cramped on the meal table in Economy class on flights .. and I guessed I had space in my usage fora smaller slate ..Thought about buying the Kindle Fire , Samsung Tab 2 and several other Androids .. but Android just does not cutit for me .. one of the main problems with Android is that if you travel a lot , and you're on an IP thatis not originating from the States , all of the Media and a lot of Apps do not work , does not not matter if your accountand your main household is in the USA .Was seriously considering Windows 8 , however I recently upgraded to Windows 8 on my desktop and was hugely frustrated ..Saw it in an apple store , and liked its Ergonomics .. and a major point in favor of Ipad offcourse is the iCloud ,Music Match , simple backup and restore .. , so thought to myself .. what the heck , let us burn a few dollars ..help apple flourish more , maybe it will help them really introduce an innovative product like they did with theoriginal Iphone and the Original Ipad .Received it today .. can't say I am surprised , same apple packing and same product but only smaller ..can't say I am bothered by the processor speed , or screen resolution .. it works all right ..Still Like the size though .. think I will be using it more than the Ipad 3 .!###I finally got my Mini IPad. I got a great deal from the Amazon Market place. I have the regular size one so I figure let me get the min one as well.I thought for sure I was going to love this little mini IPad. Something to throw in my purse and take out to use at a coffee shop or park when I want to surf the web or answer emails.It turns out I did not like it at all. I have very good vision, but this is not the greatest on the eyes (well my eyes anyhow) I find myself squinting or making the images larger and just not enjoying it as much as I love my regular IPad.It's just too small for me to enjoy it.  The regular IPad is just the right size for me........now that I love!!###I brought this to my Wife & she is thoroughly enjoying it. Its easy to handle and lovely. I like it!!!###I absolutely love my iPad mini. The ease and convenience of using it, along with the variety of thing that it can do have made it a real joy to own.!###The product arrived on the day the shipping promised it will arrived. The iPad worked amazing and now I can download programs to it. Everything about the iPad is wonderful. I have already refer this product to my friends and which seller to buy from. Thanks for sending the product on time and with best quality.!###they arived in time in APO adress-Afghanistan its nice to buy used  when they are in good care,without problems,working perfect,recived as described,good taken care from the owner,im really satisfied with the purchase,seller is perfect,5 of 5,keep doing good job,thx again!###I got this for my birthday. My hubby also brought the latest gen.larger iPad for comparison.This one makes much much better photos! It's also faster, lighter and easier to use.I've used it for 3 months and this is the best tech present i ever got! I also got the iPhone 5 but I like to use this more because of the better view.If you're hesitating about getting it, don't. It's really the best iPad/ tablet/ kindle you'll find.!###Yes! I know I paid too much for this device but I had over $250 in gift cards at Amazon and this is what I had been wanting so there you have it. Runs fast and efficiently, good for my games and basically does exactly what I expected. Happy me!!###It's everything everyone said it was - I love it and wonder why I waited so long to purchase it.  Goes everywhere with me. Love reading on it.!###I'm so happy with my iPad Mini!!!  I've already found so many great uses for it and am excited to take it on vacation with us!  I read reviews about the WiFi version not necessarily connecting to the internet very consistently, but I have found quite the opposite!The display is more than I expected, the apps availability is fantastic and the size is perfect!  My iPhone is too small to be useful for anything more than sporadic searches, but the Mini is great!  I can search just like I would on my laptop, but in a much more convenient way, i.e. I don't have to lug around my laptop and I don't need a lot of space!!###Ipad is an Apple product, then dispenses compliments as it is beautiful and works well. I am very pleased with it. The 3G works perfectly in Brazil without unlocking.!###I bought this for my wife and she is on it all the time so I assume she like it a lot lol. She tells me it works great. You might want to buy a case and some screen protectors with it. Looks way better with a case too.!###It's from Apple, but still, it's sweet.I bought mine for my wife, but I love it just as much.!###Great little product, no question. But why in the WORLD would anyone pay over retail (now $100 on AMZN) for the same item you can get from APPLE, with FREE ENGRAVING, for $100 less? Are you people mad at your money? If so, pls send any excess my way. Thanks!!###The item was labeled as &#34;new&#34;, yet after 5 days of receiving it, it did not charge and the screen kept going out. It was a defective device that was as new. Beware of this!!!!###iPad was not sealed in the box. It had been opened and was it new in box. Not a good thing.!###Screen on iPad had a touch issue which turned out to be a hardware issue and I needed to have it replaced.!###Amazing high quality build quality. Just feels SO excellent in your hand.Built to last and amaze with magic.Thin, sleek, light.Perfect screen size. Nice bright, sharp, excellent color screen.Very long battery life.Thousands of apps to amaze you.Extremely highly recommended.!###I had contacted the seller for information on a refund for the item because my wife was having some difficulty in the operation of the item. So, I thought that because the item has only been used a few times and in new condition and that I had all the original packaging, that the seller would take the item back with little to no problem. The response was that the item had to be returned in it's original packaging, obviously with an unbroken seal to get a full refund. Well, in order to use the item, you have to take it out of the original packaging (duh) and was offered an amount that was a third of what I paid for it; obviously I declined to return the item and downloaded a users guide online for $0. This is the problem: when you order something online you open it and try whatever item you ordered to make sure it works or it fits you or whatever only to find out that the item isn't right and you want to return it - sometimes as in this case it's just not worth it. I'm sorry I didn't just go buy it at Staples or Wal-Mart.UPDATE: Funny enough, after the owner of Always Innovating read my review he sent the following e-mail to me:Always Innovating:I apologize that this transaction did not meet your needs. Customer satisfaction is very important to us, and our feedback % means a lot to our business. If you would like, I can send you a complimentary cover for your ipad ( please let me know what color) if you are able to remove the negative feedback.ThanksMy Reply:Thanks, but I had purchased a cover at the same time I purchased the iPad... I have no need for another cover. Unfortunately, unless you want to refund my money in full as previously requested (minus a restocking fee of course), the review stays. I'm sorry, but I'm sure you could easily resell this item for close to what you sell them at brand newAlways Innovating:If you would like, I can issue you a 10% refund and you can keep the item.ThanksMy Reply:You are totally and completely missing the point. You previously stated that "Customer satisfaction is very important to you"; well, I am a customer and I AM NOT satisfied with the product or the way your company conducts business with it's customers. It appears to me that all you seem to care about is a negative review which clearly states the facts. I also noticed a couple of other reviews of dissatisfied customers with similar complaints. It is an insult to offer me a bribe of 10% of the $312.00 I paid in good faith to your company for a product for which I am stuck with because your company refuses to refund my money, unlike many other companies I have dealt with on Amazon. So again, unless you decide to refund the money I paid, I will return the item, (which is in pristine condition) I refuse to help you.Needless to say, I have not gotten a response. It appears as though "customer satisfaction" IS NOT A PRIORITY TO ALWAYS INNOVATING.!###Excellent quality. Can't go wrong with Apple. You get what you pay for. We found out with other electronic purchases (Samsung). Still kicking myself for going with a galaxy s3 and not the Apple I5 like my girlfriend did. So don't be cheap!!###I have this iPad Mini, Motorola Xyboard 8.2 & Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition. out all the 3 I like the Samsung Note the best. Yeah the iPad is cool but it lack functionality that I believe Apple will never add to their tablets. Multitasking & the S-Pen is a major plus and the resolution is outstanding, Expandable memory, I can go on and on but I don't have the time to do so.I gave the iPad mini to my 9 year old son. He likes it because most of his friend have been brain washed my apple. My son said he would rather have my Samsung or Motorola but those are mine.!###I have an Ipad, and i loved the new size offered by the ipad mini. It fits into any purse... it's just great! and it's just a tiny bit larger than other tablets... I love it.!###It's what I hoped it would be - a replacement for my original iPad 2. It's more portable, easier to hold, lighter than the original. It does everything the larger one does. It's larger than a 7&#34; android tablet. It fits my needs perfectly. And oh yes, it has Sari too!!###Just the perfect size in your hands bought it for my wife on mothers day liked it so much im going to have to buy one for myself!###That is a beautiful graduation gift for my daughter. She likes it very much and read a book on the first day she got it. Thanks very much!###The service of seller was good, fast shipping and nice attitude.But the charger and cable was not orginal and not working after a couple of days. I contacted the seller, he promised to send another charger, but nothing happened later.I have to buy an apple cable myself, which costed me $20 more. Anyway, the ipad mini itself is good.!###Having fought the urge to get an ipad for years due to it's price tag, I am thrilled at the mini's price. I love the smaller size verses the bigger ipads. I use this for college and play. It goes everywhere with me. The only drawback I have with the mini is it is limited in it's storage at 16 GB.!###I purchase this IPad mini in order to use it for traveling.  I have the IPad Retina but is to big for carrying in my purse.  It will do everything the bigger IPad will do but the picture is much better on the IPad Retina.  Having a few problems with the wifi staying up and had to call Apple on it.  That still hasn't totally been resolved.  But I will say the Apple people are very easy to work with.  Its sad to say but the price on the Mini was pretty near what I paid for the 10&#34; Ipad.  All in all I am very satisfied with it and just crossing my fingers that it will work in Europe when I really need it too.!###through the years i have owned various iPods. this is my first Apple product with computer like elements. i live in the mountains where my 3G smart phone has issues with coverage (a 1 foot area in my house that allows me an ok phone call) and wasnt sure if the 4G  and wifi on the iPad would work any better, it doesnt work better in fact it is worse. i try to face time with my grandson and it stops and restarts constantly. right now i'm chalking it up to my inexperience with Apple and will caontact Apple and Verizon for help! immediately. (i even tried it outside the area and had even worse luck)if you are a city person, with towers all around you- go for it!! the screen is amazingly clear. if you're a mountain person and want to use it for internet access, maps etc. - really think about it!!###I am greatly happy and satisfied to receive the item in well packed condition. It is delivered early from its schedule. The item is exactly the same 16GB Wi-Fi+3G Sprint as I ordered. It is operating very well. Your service is very much satisfactory. Thank you.!###I was about to buy a Nexus 7, but I really didn't like the screen. I tried some other android tablets about this size but none of them have the quality the iPad mini has. I think its worth to pay a bit more for a more decent screen, as I planned to use it to read and view graphic content like Pinterest, Dribbble, Photojournalism, etc.I really like how much the battery last, It's great that I can have it 2 or 3 days without charging, while I've to charge my mobile phone everyday.The downside is that in Android you've a lot more of free apps. Most of the free apps in iOS have items inside you've to pay to unlock. You may think that's because there are great quality apps, but some of them are just not so great apps insisting on sell you stuff.Finally, I really miss Swype from mi Android phone. It's still a pain for me to write on the ipad, and I see it difficult to get used to it anytime.!###Realised after I bought it that this was the old ipad and not the new one with retina display. I notified the suppliers who refunded my money immediately and without fuss. Thank you for the excellent service.!###The iPad Mini is a great little device.

It came in perfect condition. The packaging was definitely good, and I use this more than I thought I would, even when I already have a smartphone. It's super easy to carry around and I sometimes uses it to take notes in class or check emails real quick.!###The iPad works as i expected. There is only one problem: the screen is a little squishy in the upper left corner. You can feel the glass press down and it is a little worriesome. Otherwise im pretty happy with it!###When I was a kid in the 80's, this would've been awesome on long road trips.  I am thankful for technology advancing as it has - this provided my kids with great entertainment while driving and flying and going on vacations this year.  As for the iPad itself - I'm happy with it.  Easy for little hands to handle and it's just like the regular iPad only a bit smaller.  No issues with it at all!!###This was a product was a great buy and a fantastic product.  First time iPad user and I am very happy that I bought this product.  It deserved a 5 star due to the quality, purchase price, and great product.!###I had read that the screen is not as good as the full size ipad, I cannot tell the difference...!###This is everything I had hoped it would be. I like that there are so many accessories that are available for it.  They enhance the iPad's versatility.  I alsolike the size and the light weight of the iPad.!###Apple speaks for itself. The only thing I wish I would have done different is to purchase the one with internet. Great product!!###great product! wish it could do multiple tasks at one time. other than that i'm addicted to my ipad mini!!###What I love is it is so light and compact I can bring it with me everywhere.  I just love being able to find an answer immediately to any question that comes to mind.!###It's a great item, it's better than I hope. very easy to use and be portable.

Got this at a deal $252 shipped new so I'm ecstatic.!###The mini was just as described.... New. My son loves it.  The seller promised an arrival date & it was delivered on time.Thanks alot, I now have one happy young man!###Very happy with this transaction.  Arrived earlier than expected.  The mini is perfect, especially for this petite woman.  I can comfortably hold it one hand for long periods of time while swiping with the other.  Don't feel I'm losing much with the smaller screen compared to iPad.!###I purchased this item for my wife and she loves it!  She has learned more using this ipad than if she was using our decktop pc.!###I just love the size and function of this I pad mini.  It does everything I need and more.

Well, this is wonderful--download via wifi, but then I've got the book to read when I want. I kept some of my favorite apps that benefit from a larger screen, as well as apps made especially for iPad.Lightweight, easy to hold.!###My wife didn't want it but I got it for her for our anniversary.  She loves it, is watching TV in the kitchen on it, reading books so generally all the other gadgets are sitting in the corner unused.  Best $ I've spend on a gift for her so far and I'd recommend this product to anyone who needs to get something useful that will be used every day.!###Good Production, I like it very much!Thank you!Sellor provided a good speed and good customor service to me.!###I've always liked Apple products and this one is great! I like that it is smaller then the iPad 2 and yet not so small that I can't see things on the web and I read in bed or play games at night when I can't sleep.  Great for people who need to be in bed because of illness. However, I find it sometimes hard to see the header menus. You can't seem to change the font size on those. The other thing I think needs improvement is the thing is hard to hang on to. When I am reading with my thumbs gripping the sides, the screen is touched and the page I was reading turns to the next page.  A case is a must!!###It has all the features I expected and more.  I particularly like the size of the memory 64GB,  they only drawback for me is that the apps which use the keyboard feature covers what you are typing and it is difficult in instant chat situations when the autowrite feature can change your wording without you being able to correct it.  Otherwise, the product is fabuluous!!###this ipad is an excellent choice in representing the new technology in the market technological tables and hand the price is unbeatable.!###It's a nice item.  We seem to be able to replace our other brand readers and tablet with no issues at all.  I'm sure it would be a great buy for many others.!###I can't say enough. The ipad mini is just awesome. Size is perfect for work and/or gaming. Just get one.!!!!###As a former Kindle owner, I prefer the iPad whereas my husband has stuck with his Kindle.  We are an Apple household (having multiple Apple computers, iPads, and iPhones) so loving this device was no surprise. It is intuitive and user friendly with tons of great apps available.  I love the ease and convenience of carrying my books so easily everywhere I go.  Another win for Apple.  I like the fact the mini is compact as Iw ant something small to carry when I am out and about.  It weighs next to nothing and is intuitive enough for a novice to pick it up with ease!!###I like the more compact size compared to the regular-sized ipad. For me there s more than ample screen size to view movies on-the-go and to read books and news magazines!###brand beautiful new iPad mini.I love iPad mini very very much.Shpping was very good packing and very fast.!###I really like the new iPad mini, it's an amazing product. It's small, light and you can do whatever you want it!!###Great product.

So far so good! Great quality in videos and camera use! The only problems that I have had is getting use to the software, but it will take time to get used to.Fast WiFiCrisp TextBright ScreenThin and perfect sizeSmooth sliding to one page to another!###I thought the iPad 2 was pretty sweet but this is sensational. It's the real iPad (in my eyes) - so small and light. Phenominal engineering and wonderful, cheap software.  The iPad Mini is amazing.!###I receivde the package without problem and it works okIs just what I neededThanks for allbest regards!###I especially love my IPad Mini.  It is a good weight as I have trouble holding things and it is convenient whenever I need  it.!###Never turn my laptop on anymore.  Everything pulls up fast, so clear.  I never thought idcenjoybanythingvas much as I do my mini iPad.!###...you should buy it from Apple. Don't pay the inflated prices from secondary sellers. $400+ for the basic Mini? Hahaha! It retails for $329.!###I like it but was just wondering about how long it stays charged.  I thought the time was 12 hours but was just not sure.!###The iPad Mini is the best thing since sliced bread!  I'm learning that it does everything but scrub the floor!  My only disappointment is there are no instructions.  I'm aware that  mfg. don't include instructions anymore but it 's a really frustrating way to learn when you've never even held an iPAd in your hand before!  I'm sure I'll master it in time but it's not the easiest way to learn.  It would be so much more helpful if it had instructions.  Wouldn't a positive experience be better than a negative one?!###I am very happy with my iPad Mini,  Love everything about it especially the compact size, and the clarity of the screen.!###The apple ipad mini has so far surpassed by expectation. The battery life is excellent, it has a 5 mp rear camera that takes great photos. There are a lot of apps which you can get for free and some must have ones that needs to be purchased. The ipad mini is exteremly user friendly, you dont have to be a computer savy person to enjoy this magnificient piece of engineering. It is very portable, with its light weight. It has most of the capabilities as the larger ipads. I recommend this product to anyone who wants even more flexability with movement.!###Bought this as a gift for my granddaughter. Another outstanding apple product. I also own the iPad with retina display.!###bets portable tablet out there and I can sync all contents / synchronize everything with my other Apple devices. Lightweight, portable, and well-built! Couldn't ask for more! And I got it refurbished at a very competitive price.!###It fits in my purse and have it on my desk at work. It's a radio, chat and email device, I check FB all day, and use the Internet if I have to look up something. It only has the Wifi but almost all places have Wifi connection these days, so only in the car I can't use it but why would I need to while driving anyway?The size is perfect, the iPads almost look silly next to mine, like an overkill, and the iPhones seem ridiculously small compared to the Mini. It is the perfect sized Apple product of its kind! Love!!###It's great!! Purchased for wife to use and she loves its size and functionality.  Can also use to occupy grand kids!!###Got this as a gift for my husband. Absolutely loves the item. Highly recommend it! Better and more convinient than a laptop.!###It's fast, light, good battery life. It does everything u want for quick entertainment. Very easy to hold as well.!###This is a perfect version of Kindle fire or a pretty good version of Apple Ipad, the size is just perfect.!###Must pat myself on the back; product was in excellent condition; it arrived in less time than expected, so my anticipation was short lived; item was well packaged to avoid damage thru shipping & handling; item functions as it should. I'm a happy camper.!###I totally love it, even though my children ( 8 , 6 and 4 years old) play games on it all the time and i never get a chance to use it.!###Where was the iPad mini when I was young?!  This tablet is the perfect combination of form and function.  They just cost too much!!###The iPad mini is just perfect! I'm in love with the size and design of Apple's new version of the iPad.I'm in the Marines and when we're deployed, a light pack is a must and we face a lot of down-time. I had the iPad before and when I saw the iPad mini come out I had to give it a shot.I purchased the Apple iPad mini 32GB WIFI + cellular while in Afghanistan and it has been a perfect addition to my pack. It's light weight, I can fit it in my cargo pocket and 32 GB of space is plenty for my favorite TV shows and movies as well as all of my iBooks (20+) and days upon days of music to listen to while on the go.It's capable of everything the iPad was but it fits in one hand comfortably and typing on it is a breeze compared to stretching those thumbs across the screen like on the original iPad. I'd recommend this product to those looking to purchase their first tablet or those with an iPad looking to upgrade.**UPDATE**Cons:1. There isn't a retina version of the iPad mini, it shares the same characteristics of the normal size iPads other than the design and the power connector.2. Apple is likely to come out with an upgraded iPad mini in the Summer with retina so prepare to be behind the power curve as far as tablet technology.!###I looove mi iPad! The transportation time it was good, the condition it is perfect, and its work really well, so i recomended this product!###As I travel a lot, I use my iPad as a single point of work and entertainment. My previous iPad, 1st generation, was simply to heavy for long reading and a bit clumsy to carry around. iPad Mini is just the right size to follow me on my trips! Strongly recommended!!###it's the best tablet ever!! I'm so in love with it, very useful, and easy to handle and use, even my daughter knows how to use it since she's 3 years old!!! it a wonderful tool for many variarity of works...!###It was everything I was looking for. It fit my needs perfectly and I certainly would recommend it to anyone.!###Love It Bought it for my  music while i travel now i can listen to all my favorite music and check out the internet or play a game its Great !!!!!###We have one of the larger units and it was always being borrowed. This smaller unit is full of new features.!###Love it!!  It fills all my needs!! It's fast & compact - fits right in my purse so I can take it any where!!###I love this ipad,it's perfect size just put it in your handbag. There's so much information you can have at your fingertips!Every one should have one,thanks for such a nice product.!###We were very nervous about buying online, from a seller we didn't know but none of the physical stores had any ipad minis left, only ipad retnias.  We were upgrading from the ipad (original) because most of our apps were no longer update-able and most apps quit within minutes of being opened.  The ipad mini is SUCH an improvement, i wish we hadn't waited so long! The graphics are so much crisper than the original ipad, and the apps are all very fast and responsive.  I was worried that we wouldn't like the size, but I actually like the smaller size better because when I hold the ipad portrait, i can easily type with my thumbs without having to stretch into awkward positions.  The ipad arrived quick, and was packaged well.!###Three days after i revived it. I broke the screen after I accidentally droped a laptop cord on it. i contacted Apple and went to the store asking if they could replace the screen and i'll pay for it, but the only option they gave me is to buy a new one for $219.!###She didn't think she would use it much, now she wonders how she lived without it!Overall, a good purchase for us.!###Had to have a little help from my son, but is easy to use.  It is light and easy to carry.!###It fits in all my purses! Works great! The lighting cords break after a few months-but I get cheap ones!!###I like the silver the best, the front border is white. I ordered 2 space grey iPad Minis for my daughters at Christmas. My husband also has silver. Wish I could use more than one app at a time but this works well. Lots of free apps and games. Visual is not affected by the sun as seen on TV.!###It was a birthday gift for my sister.I got one for my birthday last year and love mine so I thought it would be a great gift for my sister.She loves it !!###Got this one for my daughter she  is Autistic , we took it to disneyland and save our lives! My daughter loved it! So easy to use, perfect size, picture and volume. Very happy :)!###This was a gift for my sister and she loves it.  The seller was correct in everything he had stated about it.  Even though it was a store display it was in perfect condition and would buy from him again.!###Bought this ipad mini for family entertainment.  My 4 year granddaughter has learned so much through it's apple apps!  I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to spend too much money but wants to have a variety of educational and entertainment apps.!###Although I found this product very fragile, I am still amazed! Regarding all the things it can do &#8211; and it always seems able to perform the tasks I need...Lead tech D!###My mum said, hey it's nice and she usually use it for movie and gaming.Great to use, share me when it have more discount.!###I am in love with this iPad mini!!!!  I have no problem with the non-retina display.I feel like a normal ipad is way to large.  This fits in your hand perfectly and is definitely large enough to read and watch movies on et cetera!###excellent product, pristine condition, beautiful and good to work, I loved it; I have IPhone 5s so I decided to go for this Tablet too, now I am done with phone and Tablet, good companion for my phone.!###Definitely saved myself some money here because at any other store you'll be paying more than $300. I do recommend buying a protective case since it's not insured while your on Amazon anyways.!###I had no doubt this would be anything other than pure digital greatness! I have a multitude of idevices and i also develop and service all idevices... I was a bit sketchy about ordering a device of sorts through a service like Amazon, but then again Ive come to trust Amazon for quite some time now and I was not disappointed. Great product, great service...!###Steve Jobs once said that 7" screen is too small to do anything productive. I am glad he changed his mind.iPad Mini is a perfect sized tablet for casual users like me who use the device to browse, facebook, do online shopping, check emails, and play games like Temple run. iOS also makes it perfect for my son who gets to learn his ABC and numbers with several apps available in the iTunes store.The Wi-Fi sync feature is my favorite - something that allows me to keep my music in sync without finding cables and connecting to my laptop. iCloud is a perfect service for keeping my photos backed up - especially when my little one learns a new trick and decides to suddenly show it to us :-)!###Am very very please will tell friends to purchase it am very please with my purchase don't have no complain!###I am not an apple guy, but my son loves it. so it is perfect product fo a gift.It is amazing and fast and light.!###Ordered one for my husband for birthday recently and I got one in April and I love the size and its does everything I want.!###Upon receiving my new mini I noticed that the top left corner was slightly damaged.  Small screen chip/crack.  I contacted the seller who passed me off to Apple to correct the problem.  Contacted Apple and they said I'd have to pay for a new screen.  I've decided to just protect it in a case until the screen is unusable instead of reaching into my own pocket again to buy a new screen for a new mini.It's still working well and I do like the item.  Hopefully others take a very close examination upon receiving their apple products.!###I bought this for my wife. I am not a fan of the IPad; however, she says it's ok. We live/work overseas and we use some applications over here. She expected the IPad to do more things such as &#34;Viber&#34; which is an App that is used over here, but that App isn't supported on the IPad. There are a couple other Apps that Anroids have which the IPad doesn't support.!###soo cute,,and fast for shipping!.. great item!..soooo cute i loved the color and size,, not big was  good for travel it is perfect!!..i love it!!###I got a Amazon gift card for mother's day.  I really never shopped on Amazon, so I really did not know what to buy. Even though I already had an iPhone 4, I decided to purchase the iPad Mini on Amazon.  It was at a great price from the Seller.  After I bought it I fell in love with it and I use it all the time.  The difference between my iPhone and iPad Mini is that I can see the words better because it's much bigger on the iPad Mini and I especially loved the Photo Booth icon that comes with it.  I have been having so much fun taking those crazy pictures that I have laughed myself silly.  It's a great, fun gadget to have.  Thanks to my family for the Amazon gift card!!###I bought this Ipad for my girlfriend for her birthday and she absolutely loves it.  From email to surfing the web to watching videos, this iPad allows her to do it all.!###Great price, and quick delivery. I purchased this for myself to read, play games and keep connected. It is so easy and I love it.!###have an ipad mini is that each should live experience is excellent and thanks amazon and the seller could get and have this product that makes life easier for anyone with its simple menu and simple software startup. Excellent quedarle I have it again thanks for helping me get this product. greetings Leonardo Padron!###Got this for my wife when she told me she was admiring one that her student had. She is freaking in love with this thing now! I think I may need to fight it for her time. LOL.Great size for those who don't want to lug around a 10 inch device and large enough display to allow for crisp, clean images. I am now my wife's hero thanks to the Apple iPad mini!!###I was expecting some kind of a manual or directions to come with the iPad mini.  I set it up according to all the prompts but still having trouble with it telling me my password or Apple ID# I entered is incorrect.!###It works smooth and quality is clearly the best in the market. It is an Apple product. Do I need to say more?!###I highly reccomend this because of the quality, speed of shipment and the great price you would be missing out if you dont get this.!###i love IT its so portable and convenient to carry with you light weight but not fragil and i can charge it in my car at home or where ever i happen to be!###I love this iPad mini tablet.  It's just the right size to fit nicely in my purse.  It does everything I imagined it would.  Compact, lightweight and easy to use.  It's better than lugging a laptop and more practical than my iPhone 5C in terms of size.!###We purchased this item for our daughters birthday...She loves Poshmart and was using her iPhone for this....a little hard to watch continuously so we got her the mini iPad....She love love loves it....She is on it constantly.....easy to use.....easy to carry around, she just drops it into her purse and off she goes..Much easier on her eyes....A great gift overall!###My wife loves it. It is small enough to carry in her purse. When she is happy, I am happy.!###My mother learned to use a Windows 7 netbook machine in her 70s. However, the computer got uncomfortably warm and thus was not ideal for using in a sofa. She loves her iPad Mini. I no longer have to worry about viruses, updates rebooting the system, &#34;your computer is too slow&#34; errors on Skype... And a touch interface is certainly a lot more intuitive for people not too familiar with computers.A few of the bad things about this are:-Since it's small, my mother sometimes have to press several times on onscreen buttons until it activates. I guess at least for native apps they could have adjusted the size of the buttons so they remain as easy to press as in a big iPad.-No ability to download music directly to the device to the Music app... Unless you purchase it on iTunes. This is one of the biggest issues preventing iOS devices from being fully independent from computers.-No flash for the back camera-iPhone apps look ugly on it, because they don't display in iPhone 4 resolution, but it iPhone 3GS resolution (pre-retina). This means pixels have to be doubled.An unexpected bonus was:-A fully functional compass. I wish my iPod Touch had one.!###Apple products are usually all the same, but the quality is very good, becomes hot easily after i used it for a while.!###The mini is everything I hoped it would be. The same functionality as my iPad but so much lighter and easier to maneuver and carry, particularly for travel.!###Works as described. No issues encountered so far (1 month) Perfect price. No complaints what so ever. My mother liked it as a gift. Works exactly as your regular IPAD.

Highly recommend for anyone! :)!###Somewhat unstable when taking photos with the back camera. Not comfortable to take pictures that way with the trigger button as it is. Needs some rethinking or re-positioning.!###This is my first iPad. After many of my friends were using them to benefit from all the spiritual gems they could download and have at their fingertips I decided to join the club.!###I purchased this as a Christmas gift for someone and they love it and use it practically every day.  For the price, this is definitely recommended.!###iPad mini is a great investment.  Price was a little better than in stores, ordering is easy thru Amazon and always very speedy delivery.  The iPad is extremely easy to set up and screen is vivid and easy to manage. Thank you.!###try handing this to a senior citizen. its shortfalls will be very apparent.Good:-Beautiful display-Solid build-Light as can be.Bad:-Interface was designed for a 10&#34; device (see Regular iPad), thus touch targets are hard to hit at times.-the size will be just a pinch too big for most female hands or smaller male hands. the pictures of it being gripped from both sides is a bit misleading for the lower end of the bell-curve of population.i've since sold my device and i'll keep my money handy for the next iteration of the iPad (XL?). This device ended up being delegated to checking email and nothing more since it became a hinderance.Your mileage will vary. others i've spoken to love its size and it will fit into their work-flow much easier. it just didn't fit well into mine.!###The thing is worth it. By far it is the coolest gadget I have ever bought and I would buy it again.!###Portability is a huge plus. Also, I was able to take handwritten notes for Chemistry even with the small size of the mini.  The small size did not diminish the ability to have hand written notes electronically vs real paper.  Tons of apps make the iPad my only choice for a tablet.  Wifi is great!  Great range!!###Okay so I got this as a Christmas present and I fell in love with it the sec I seen it, it fit in my hand perfectly and it is vary lightweight. It is supper fast wish I could of gotten the 3G or 4g on but oh well and it is vary durable I left int in my car when going snowboarding  in  -10 deegres F and when I was done and got back to the car I was afraid it wouldn't work because I had a 3rd gen iPod touch and the scene stopped working because of the cold and yeah then this summer I when down to southern Texas in left it in the car again in 118 degree weather and when I go back that heat warning was on and I waited 15 min and then it worked fine. I have dropped it once or twice from like 3 feet off the ground and nothin has happen but yet 3 feet isn't a lot but I am not just going to drop 10 ft off the ground to see and Siri is amazing they can make her better  by letting her have convstations  with the user but otherwise amazing it is way better than voice control. I would recommend this to anybody who need simple technology. Because me dad is a computer geek and he hates apple product because he said it is technology for dummies haha but yeah I like it a lot so I would say great for teens and young adults.!###I've had the iPad mini since it came out and while I love the form factor of the iPad mini, it is lacking somewhat on the computing power side.  I normally use my iPad while traveling for movies and browsing the internet (travel almost every week for work).  The iPad mini is almost perfect for traveling and browsing the internet but the lack of power really holds it back from getting 5 stars for me.  The iPad mini struggles a bit to play HD movies/shows... I usually use my mini at hotels hooked up via HDMI to the hotel TV so I can watch movies/etc full screen.  I don't have too many issues with playing SD videos but HD videos stutter a lot and are pretty much unwatchable (should be noted that the HD files I used were h264 files in an mkv container and played via an app called Azul).  It would be great if the mini had a retina screen as well because text would be much easier to read.  That being said, I'm still happy with the current gen iPad mini and don't mind the trade off in power and lack of retina for form factor and size.  That being said, if the next gen mini is significantly more powerful and has a retina screen, I know I'm going to be all over it.!###got my mini ipad a day earlier then it stated and it works great would recommend this product and this company to anyone.!###I love my IPad mini. I was a bit nervous about ordering it online after some reviews I read, but mine came in in perfect shape.!###Was what was advertised and shipped in a timely manner.Like the size of the mini vs the full size Ipad.I don't feel color is a big issue, especially if you are putting into a case.!###I got this for my boyfriend for a gift and amazon wrapped it up so nicely and they put my card on their with a bow. My boyfriend is obsessed with it and says the iPad is easy to handle and very light weight.!###Shipping was fast.  Brand new in unopened original box, as described. It is working perfectly.  Very Glad,,,,,happy ah!! price was good too.:)!###This device rocks! Its larger than my iphone so I can actually enjoy using the screen for games, movies, and pictures. The OS is fast and easy to navigate. Apple has done it again.!###My daugther is in love with her ipad, she use it for her homework, play and share her photos and lot more  thanks!###Just like any other i-Device by Apple.  I love the size and weight to the iPad Mini.  It took a while to set up simply because I didn't know if it had a sim card in it.  It does, but you have to pop it out and write down the code to hook up to your network.  It took me maybe an hour to get it properly setup, including going to Verizon Wireless and paying the extra money to tether the device to my service.  Took an hour or so for it to actually connect.  Since then, it's worked wonders.  I love this thing and take it with me to work everyday.  Oh, if you're concerned about battery life, don't be.  I let it run for over two weeks with facebook and other apps on in the background while I had it in sleep mode.  It took that entire time to drain the battery down.  I also had wifi on which is another battery drain.  It holds charge very well, wish my iphone 5 did that.!###I didn't get my iPad mini from Amazon I got mine from Best Buy, I use my iPad mini to write essays and to do my homework online. I'm currently using it right now to write this review. I really like my iPad mini because it has Siri and all the new updates with the iPhone c an iPhone s. If you have an iPhone 4 or 4s, the chargers are different then the 5. If you have your updated iPhone to iOS 7 you can if you don't have it connected to your phone plan you can turn on your hotspot and it has a password and it's just like using data on your phone. Beware that you are using data so you don't want to be on your iPad mini too much but when you using your hotspot it's just like having Wi-Fi and you put in your password for your hotspot and you can basically be on your iPad mini anywhere and have Internet and be able to look at emails and whatever else you want to do. On the iPhone that Apple Pages cost money but on your iPad mini it won't cost anything. I recommend it for someone who doesn't want a full-size tablet or iPad and wanted something just you can put in your purse or backpack really easily. I also recommend it for anyone who may be doing schoolwork you can get cheaper words and it could be just like a little computer or laptop. Also when I say like a computer or laptop it won't have all the functions as a computer or laptop I don't want to get anyone confused. Things that you can do on your laptop you won't be able to do on your iPad mini but having the keyboard makes it easier to type things if you are typing anything such as emails. Only thing I really don't like about Apple products are the brightness I don't know if I'm only person who feels like their products are too bright at night. When reading the book on your iPad or iPhone it's really annoying to have such a bright screen and I have to invert the colors because the brightness is to bright at night and not bright enough in the day. No this is only me I have heard other people say same thing but if you don't mind brightness and little things like that the iPad mini is really a great product.!###I love the iPad Mini.  It is just the right size to carry in my purse.  The resolution of the iPad mini is very clear and bright.!###The mini iPad  was just a good as my regular size iPad but size wise much more convenient to travel with, I also needed the cellular option for travel purposes.  So far I am very pleased with my purchase.  The delivery time was excellent.!###Be careful!!! I purchased this as "new", but when I called apple to register it, turns out it had a previous owner. They only has it for a few months but still, if I wanted to buy a used ipad, I should have paid used prices. I called amazon and they gave me some of my money back. I'm fine with it now since I received a nice refund and it works just fine.!###Best purchase I have made in a long time.  Sold my android tablet and my Kindle Fire; bought this.  So light weight and portable.  Drop it in my purse and go.  Needed help setting it up to send and receive mail.  Now that it is up and running, I love it.!###the appel ipad i got crashes alot ! but i mean a lot. i always need to restart it and fix it up!###I bought this from amazon warehouse deals and it was awesome I got it at a very good price and it was just like new sealed in the box and everything.!###Very pleased with the size and convenience of it.  It's perfect for around the house, car and even trips I'm my purse.  I would highly recommend it.!###I mean, it's an ipad.  It is exactly as expected.  Fits in a lab coat pocket, or into any purse/bag.!###My son love this also he is 15 so I promised him if he did well in schoolI would get it for his birthday he loves it!###lots of games and education tools. My children love it. We have already two for the three children (some disputes occur...).!###It's an ipad -- it's great. It works just like the other ipads that we have and the size is great!###I love this product, I am a recent Apple convert and I'll never go back. Easy to use, set up, and navigation is a breeze! I am so happy with my purchase, it is priced to move the only complaint I have is with the delivery. My iPad mini was left balanced on top of my gate where it could have been stolen or fallen off to break, I was home waiting for it to be delivered and there is no excuse for that. BTW,...it wasn't shipped via a big service or the usps,...!###It was in perfect condition tyvm for everything. Love the product and i use all the time now. Very satisfied!###It arrived will packaged and in excellent shape.  This used iPad looks and works like a brand new one with out the price.  It was just what the seller said it was.  Very pleased with purchase.!###Serves the purpose, works well, decent battery life. It was a gift for the school age girl, and she is very happy with it.!###It is a very good product, as we can inagine. wifi connection is sometimes slow and the device does not connect to a wifi right away, it takes some time. for comparaison the ipod touch connects immediately, maybe it is my conenction.I do not regret that purchase.!###Great item!! I'm an Android fan but I do enjoy using IOs. It's nice to be able to go back and forth between the two OSs!###The product was wonderful. I look forward to many more purchases from Jupiter Mall. They are truly a Class Act.!###Got this for a very good deal and thee ipad came looking brand new with retail box and all accessories.!###The mini is a great tool.  The size makes it much more portable than the original.  The battery life may be a bit less than that of the ipad2.!###Excellent size, clarity, operation and ease of use.Once I signed in, I had all my books, songs, emails, and pictures, etc.This is the absolute no brainer tablet.!###realy enjoying the ipad.  the only problem is I am having a hard time opening certain documents in my email on it.!###Received this a s a gift from my sister as I was presenting her with this as well! Great minds think alike! While she is a technology/electronic snob, I am more easy to please but I really love the iPad Mini and use it every day!!!###I have to judge this product based on performance & craftsmanship but I just don't get the hype. It's a nice tablet that you can do a lot with but with all of the commercials, write-ups in blogs and magazines & fanatics making it sound better than world peace or the invention of fire, I expected more.It is well-made, has a great screen size with great viewing for photos, videos & art online & in files. Screen resolution is wonderful. It is great to browse the web & read books/personal files on. I find myself watching videos on this a bunch & it's like having a mini television. The apps it comes with require that you log into or create an apple ID. This is what started my issue with the unit.I've had a nano since they came out & a nice collection of iTunes to jam to. When I tried to log in using the mini, I got locked out of my account & lost access to years of my jams. &#62;:( This really p!ssed me off. All of what they have as feature requires you to meld with the cursed apple App Store. I have no desire to be tied to them like that & feel that they force your hand. I suppose I could've just returned the accursed thing, so I won't harp too much but it did ruffle these feathers!All in all, it's a good product but I did not become more attractive, smarter nor did I suddenly become more popular than I already was.!###I bought this for my daughter for her 6th bday and she loves it has not put it down. Plays youtube fine downloads apps in a flash picture is great. Perfect for her little hands.!###it's easy to carry. This i-pad is IOS 6, but I could upgrade to IOS 7. So it's more cheaper now.!###This is a great product and the price beat all the other places we looked!  I would do business with this dealer again.!###It`s awesome i love it. I do everything on the ipad from work to check my social networks. it hurt because it came with a manufacturing defect in the apple store but they changed me immediately by Apple warranty!###Once I figured how to use it, I like it.  There should be an instruction book with it.  Through a mixup w order cart two were sent to me and charged also, although I had deleted  one of them on my order.  Was rather disappointed by that. Didn't bother returning it , as I figured that would be goofed up too.!###Love the size. Carries all my documents. Email. Texting.  Pix. Need I say more!! I have bought one for family members as well!!!!###Wonderful device, I enjoy the ability to transfer data off of my iPhone to my iPad and the easy to carry size of the iPad mini.!###Of course it is made by apple so it is high qaulity. The only thing I would say is they should have made this a phone as well. Its not tooo big to be a phone so why didnt they just add it as an option?!###I'm thoroughly enjoying my iPad mini.  I've used it almost as much for essential communications as I have for entertaintainment.!###Nice and light and did everything my granddaughter needed it to do.  I especially the lightness compared to my regular size I pad.!###I purchased the iPad Mini as a replacement for my aging Nook Color e-reader and a larger companion to my iPhone. Overall I'm thrilled. It arrived in perfect condition and works beautifully. It's light, fast, and the 32-gig version holds all of my apps and pictures with plenty of room to spare.Docking a star because it takes far too long to charge.Finally, if you can afford to spend a little extra for the new Mini with retina display, I recommend it. The resolution and camera quality on this version of the are disappointing for the price.!###The Mini was as advertised and is so much better to use then the regular Ipad.Light and built well.!###The IPad mini is an outstanding tablet device.  The camera especially takes outstanding pictures.  The slim size and portability are also great features.!###It is exactely what I have expected to be. Smaller and lighter than an iPad. I like it.

Use it everyday for all kinds of things. Am constantly finding new ways to work it into my mini iPad lifestyle. Yeah! So glad I got the mini because I wouldn't carry the larger one to all the places I take this one. It's so much more useful than a celphone and so much more &#34;there when I need it&#34; than my laptop.!###I got the iPad mini about 6 months ago as a gift for the wive. Beside that she love it, I see her using it constantly so it was money well spent.Very responsive, light, well built. It goes wherever we go and it has been a great travel companion.The charger cable has very small plug at the end and I like the fact that it goes in the iPad in any orientation.It's a very convenient device in every aspect.!###My husband and son love theirs.  They play art games with one another, they research, the connect with friends.  It fits nicely into the hand and is extremely portable and well-protected in the case.  We call my husband's the &#34;electronic lady&#34; because he cannot keep his hands off &#34;her&#34;.  He is however, now researching more with the family for items he needs rather than in his office on the computer.!###It's super light in weight and very easy to manage. All images look great. Once its charged the battery lasts a long while. There's no need to have a bigger one. It fits anywhere.!###I got it earlier than expected and it works perfectly. I love it. Looking forward to upgrading my iPhone later this year.!###My son loves it and the product has worked out wonderful for my son and his needs.  Price a little to high!###Been super handy and helpful classroom companion (especially after teacher banned laptops in class, but not tablets!). Love the many apps. For class notes, I use Notability (with built in recording feature) and for pdf reading I use Good Read. iOS 7 is also a pleasure. Love the design and feel of it. That said I still prefer doing most intensive tasks on my laptop, but the iPad is a great addition to my tech device team. :)!###I love this for the gym. I can watch movies and do cardio. Love it and for me a perfect fit.!###My order came quick and was in perfect condition! Quality service. I love the mini iPad because it is easy the handel and fits great in my purse.

She's been using our daughter's ipad 3rd generation and she said that this ipad mini is the perfect size for her. It fits in her small purse and is easy to hold with one hand. Someone at her workplace who was considering buying a samsung tablet changed his mind when he saw her ipad mini. I was a little hesitant to order this on amazon because some people's review say that they're getting items that don't seem brand new and looking like they're pre-owned. Well, so far I never had any problems with amazon orders so I based my decision on that. When my wife opened the package, I asked her if it looked brand new and she said that it doesn't get any newer than how it looks. So the other reviews remain hearsay to me.!###It's great, I love it, no issues and I will definetly be coming back for more of my electronic needs.!###needed an upgrade from my gen 1 Ipad.

If you're keeping lots of photos get the 64.!###I bought one at the apple store yesterday and I love it. I was unhappy with my current tablet. Upon first use it was obvious to me that the ipad is superior  to everything on the market. I finally understand why everyone loves these thing!. Super fast, a lot of power. I watched movies all night with flawless streaming. AND GUESS WHAT??!?!?  You can watch your amazon unbox videos and movies on it!!!!!  Its the only tablet outside the kindle Fire that allows access to amazon digital movies/tv. !!  main reson i wanted this for i was tired of having 2 tablets. I had a kindle fire and a toshiba excite. now i can sell my other 2 and keep this.Only thing i did not like is it asks you for your password everytime you download an app!###It was good, it gave me a little trouble after it didn't turn on. But going down to the apple store, and it still having warranty. I went down to the apple store and got a brand new one for free.!###Love my ipad mini. Size is really nice cause I can throw in my purse and it is small but big enough to read!!###I'm not a "techie"! But, I'm so glad that I bought this iPad. I've been using an 8 GB iPod for years and have been running out of space. Hence, the need for the switch. The display is clean and crisp. It's nice to have a larger screen to work with. Loaded with all the apps I've grown to love on my iPod. This is a must have for anyone who is intimidated by Androids (like me!)!!!!###Got this for my girlfriend since she likes to travel a lot. It is also great for work. Would recommend and purchase again. Happy wife....happy life :)!###Everything you love about your iPhone, but much more useful for at-home time. Light, awesome battery, and the same high hardware quality of any Apple product.!###Exactly what I needed. It's lightweight, portable, easy to use, and came with it's own charging cable. Great product and a better deal than on Apple's site.!###This is a really awesome product.. I'm really happy with it.. I love it..!! I would definitely buy another one..!!!###What can I say. I love the Ipad mini. Easy to carry and has all the functionality of a full iPad.!###Works great, and is in great condition. Came in plastic bag without charging cables, or headphones.

Love being able to take it everywhere and even fit in my purse if needed. Just what I expected with Apple!!###my son loves it. he has special needs and is able to use it. Good battery life.Suggest getting outterbox case!###I chose the mini iPad because of it's size and ease of operation when traveling. I can still do 99 per cent of what I need to do vs. a PC. It'S ease of setup is very good. It works as advertised. I'm very happy with my purchase. I would definitely recommend one to my friends.!###Love this mini ipad!!!  Love the size, just love everything about it.  Use it for everything, emailing, texting, gaming, SHOPPING!!!  Its the perfect size.!###Bought this for my fiance&eacute; to take to school for taking notes and storing files. She can't get enough of it. This is great if you're the type of person that walks around the house constantly browsing through your phone, or you hate waiting for your desktop/laptop to boot up. I would consider purchasing a second one (may wait for the iPad 5 to drop in Oct though!).!###I would recommend this item if you don't have too many apps. If you want something simply for browsing the internet then I advise you to get the 16GB model if you want to download a huge selection of movies and music I suggest getting something with more memory. Other than that I definitely would get this, simply because I bought it for internet browsing.!###Love everything about this tablet. Another masterpiece from apple. It came earlier than expected (fantastic seller) packaged perfectly, brand new and with everything included. Works great, if your thinking about buying one I say do it! You won't be disappointed!###I love my iPad mini.  It is small enough to carry around in my purse but big enough to enjoy watching Netflix or Hulu.  Apple is a great company and makes great, quality products.!###7 inches is the right size! I used to own an iPad 2, i had to sell it and I replaced it with the mini. Wonderful upgrade, it has all the latest functionalities and it just feels great on the hand.I do not miss retina on a tablet since I never had a retina iPad, but this does work great for me, as an e-reader, facetime, even netflix.!###I bought this for my ten-year-old, who needs a computer for homework and trips, but I think I use it almost as much as she does.I live in the boondocks, and even a trip to the grocery store takes almost two hours each way, so I needed something she could use in the car.  We've loaded a couple of movies on her ipad, and she has a whole bunch of games that keep her occupied.  She also uses this for homework, which frees up my computer and makes things a lot easier on all of us.My only complaint is that this doesn't come with much memory, and it doesn't have a way to add any more.  We used up her memory fairly quickly and had to clear out some things (or move them to her cloud), which wasn't ideal.  Still, definitely worth the money!!###The iPad came slightly damaged and this was not described. The box was sealed so I assumed the damage may have occurred during shipping... Contacted the seller who after long deliberation offered a discount which I accepted since the iPad was a gift and returning was a bit complicated... The iPad works fine thus far and since the damage was to the back and a case was bought also we never see it nor are we affected...!###Great product, the way I like it!!for the prize and the size is the perfect one a great buy nice!###What can I say, it's an Apple tablet. It's a very nice size, easy enough to read, easy to hold in one hand, much larger screen than Android 7&#34; tablets such as the Galaxy Tab.  Same operating system and Apps as our Iphones. It was a present for my wife, and it fits nicely in her purse.The only reason we gave it 4 stars was that the screen came with a lot of lines in it. We called Apple and they said it was a hardware defect. We took it to an Apple store and they exchanged it for a new one in working order.!###My fianc&eacute; loves it I'm in the military and we use it to skype almost every night it makes me feel at home for a little while!###I received my 2 Ipad minis way very quickly, and was surprised at the good condition the products were in. As far as how they run I have see how they work in the next few days. For now everything seems good.My two girls love their new toy. It replaces all the Leap  Brand toys that had to have batteries replaced a lot, it also eliminated us having to purchase cartridges.!###I love the IPad mini. It is a great color and works great for what I need it for. Happy!###Exceeded my expextations. The shipper shiped it sooner the expected and no porblems at all. Purchased as a birthday gift and have no worries about it being a surprise.

Highly recommend this item but you don't want to pay the big bucks for the large ipad.Love it!!!###I debated over the regular sized IPad and the mini.

Delivered in the condition as it was described and ahead of delivery date.!###Love my IPad mini!  I was using myLaptop but now I take my IPad mini to work in place because of size and convenience!  Have had no problems with it!!###My overall opinion is that the Ipad Mini great. It's great for kids, teenagers, adults, and old people too. It's not too small, nor too big, just right. Just needs more space.  The Ipad Mini uses I.O.S 7 software. I.O.S 7 is fast, it's completely changed Apple's look. It's got new backgrounds that move. The only problem is it takes 3.1 GB.  Next the Ipad Mini (I think) is better than the Ipad 3 and 4 gen. Because it's small enough to fit in a teenagers' pocket, but it's not to small.  The Ipad Mini is altogether good, except I would get 32 GB instead, because I have used all the memory. I have to keep deleting apps for other apps.!###Great buy. I use it everyday.  Easy to operate.  I am not a tech person but I can use this without a problem.!###I bought this for my daughter's birthday as a blessing for selling so many of her toys at our garage sale.

I like apple products and was really happy to see the mini .I along with my children purchased this particular I pad for my Mom for her Birthday and she loved it too.!###We bought this as a gift for our daughter and she loves it!  She takes advantage of all of its features.!###IPAD MINI  by the awesome 12I give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars.I bought the ipad mini after my friend showed me what it does.Like it can be updated to ios7.The one thing that hit me hard was the price but everything was just great about it.It is super strong thin and lite it can even fit in to your bag or what ever you carry around .So this one time i was coming home from school.So i hop off the bus and guess what happen i drop it then i was like what is mom going to say.But then i flip it over and not one crack in it so i did not tell my mom that i dropped it.You can get 64 GB that is too much for me.You can get it in black or white.It is a fun little toy to play with it and it is super fast .Compared to the i pad 2 the i pad mini is a long shot win.The one thing about the i pad 2 is that it is super ez to brake and it is ez to drop.But with the i pad mini it like grips to your hands and you can not drop it and if you do somehow drop it i will not crack .I recommend this for a the apple lovers and if you have the money have fun with your i pad mini!###You cant go wrong with Apple.The size and bezel of the iPad mini is awesome, its really sleek and light.!###I'm wishing I'd made a smarter decision on my iPad Mini purchase. I'm regretting it now. Not because it isn't a nice device. But because it lacks a GPS chip. I decided I could live with the low res display and and the iPhone 4S internals. But I didn't know I couldn't navigate with it.I bought a car dock designed for the smaller tablets and was getting ready for some cool navs with my Mini. I tethered it (mine's a wifi-only) to my phone and proceeded to run a route. Unfortunately it wasn't working well. It wasn't following my course or refreshing. Had to be the data signal on my phone or lower spec'd GPS hardware in the Mini, I told myself. After troubleshooting it online I discovered Apple chose not to equip the wifi-only Mini with a GPS chip.Now I'm saddled with a lackluster experience from my brand new iPad Mini. It's still a nice device. Just not a happy-inducing!###Very convenient for checking e-mail.  This size fits nicely into my purse.  Great to take along when traveling or cruising..!###easy  to use The size of the mini is just short of an inch wider than your typical competitor. I like it by the way!###I know the price is up there, but honestly, everything TRIES to be link the iPad.you either have it, or you don't.  It is exceptional in the speed and reliability of the device.  With it's A5 processor,  it never lags or has you tapping your fingers waiting for something to finish (other than a sync).I am an old time computer user (over 30 years).... and never liked the idea of the iPad, but since I have one, I can now not live without it.  Might not run like my mac - (Won't run os x applications) but with release of most of the apps I have on my mac, for the IOS device, there is little I can't do on this device.  LOVE IT.!###My iPod mini does everything and more. I could not be happier. It's light, thin and easy to carry with me anywhere.!###I bought this for my mom but one day it stopped charging and would only charge to 9%.  Apple was great to exchange it for a brand new ipad mini at their store.!###I can't say enough about this device. It is convenient, easy to handle and the picture quality is outstanding. I can google faster on this than my desktop. It is well worth the money I paid for it.!###I own a gen 2 iPad and use it all the time.  My next iPad will be of the mini persuasion since I really like that size. Will probably wait till the next release to see what new enhancements Apple is working on.  I purchased this one for my brother.  He also likes the size and fact that is so easy to conceal when traveling.!###Excellent and easy to install and well worth the price paid for the acquiredThank you for the high quality!###Would by again and great Christmas present!  Excellent value for the money and would rec to others.  The is working as promised after 6 weeks of using.!###Very convenient cause I'm at university right now and I don'ti need to carry tHe laptop all the time cause it's a bit heavy!###This is a great mini iPad. Works like every other iPad. Very fast for it size. Love the games you can download to it. Very light and the battery life is about 8 to 10 hours depending on how you use it but really a great apple product.  Love it.!###We ordered this I-Pad mini to use for road trips because my husband is in the military and we travel often. It's been awesome so far keeping my daughter entertained!!###Amazon is always easy to deal with, and the mini replaces one stolen from me on a flight from Chicago to Dusseldorf.!###Responsive. Glad I got her the mini. The larger iPad would have been too large for her needs. Got it fast also.!###I bought the iPad mini for my wife's birthday. She love's it and I'm a hero.

I was always told that they are not new but repackaged used models. The one I bought looked new to me. It acted new too. I love it. Its in new condition and the purchaser said it was new.

He loves it and it is easy for him to carry with him.!###When the iPad mini first came out, I thought it was neither fish nor fowl.  And I must say that the difference in price between the mini and the &#34;full-sized&#34; iPad was a factor.  But I really like the size, and the screen is big enough for the kind of use I'll give it.  And although I bought a keyboard to go with it, I found myself using the on-screen keyboard to take notes at a day long meeting.!###It's your typical Apple product.  Very user friendly and intuitive, great graphics and wonderful product support.  I like the smaller size for reading online content.!###Read the previous reviews and decided to try.  I can confirm: 1) received on the earliest day of the anticipated time, 2) shipped same day, 3) condition is really like newThx a million.!###Thank you the I pad is almost like new and thank you for the covers. Also, the price is a great!###There's no doubt about it, apple holds still number one, it's my second mini, and I can't wait until the  next one comes out, WOW good job apple!!! You are still nnumber one!!!!!###The iPad mini is just the right size for my uses. It is small enough for using the touch screen for typing without a sylus, yet large enough to use for reading books. My only negative is the screen may be too small for some websites to view easily. Yet if you are willing to use the zoom mechanism to view part of the website, then this may be the product for you.!###I just rated the iPhone 5s thinking I was rating the iPad mini, because the were purchased together.  Bottom line is they are both excellent product. Easy to use and is more compatible with many more apps than its competitors. This is my second purchase but I find thus size more comfortable and less bulky than the regular size.!###Love it. Still learning things about it but so far I love it. I like the small size, easy to carry around. Can stick it in my pocketbook.!###I love this iPad. Seriously it's better in this size, I use it for all of my internet needs and makes some apps better, like drawing.!###The iPad Mini is perfect. I have had no probems with it whatsoever. The negative reviews surprised me because it's hard for me to imagine anyone NOT loving the Mini. Yes, it's smaller than the regular iPad. But there is nothing that the regular iPad can do that the Mini can't so if you would like the 7&#34; screen, go for it! The screen is clear, the selection of apps is unbeatable, and I've never had a problem from moving from one place to another. You can't go wrong with th Mini!!###The mini is great for when my wrists get tired of holding my large iPad because of the weight. However I still love my ipad3 because of the size!!! It does everything the large iPad is capable of.!###Amazing product - great price!  Shipped very carefully as well!  I would highly recommend this product to anyone!  It replaces the need for a computer!  It can do everything and is so small and convenient to take anywhere!  :)!###In many respects I prefer the iPad mini over the iPad2 which I have owned for several years. The mini is much lighter and easier to hold and yet it provides a large enough image to read books and do other iPad functions. I purchased this iPad mini for my mother in law who has difficulty holding the heavier iPad2 while reading.!###It's the perfect size iPad, I used this for about a year and loved every minute.  Great size while watching mobile video, lightweight easy to carry in a growing bag of electronic accessories.  My two year old loves using the PBS app, recommend a protective carry case for kids.  Other than that it is all you come to expect from a mobile Apple product.!###Awesome product. Awesome store. Great deal!What else could you ask for? Even better than the previous iPad.Highly recommended.!###.Lovely piece of kit.  Easy to use. Light weight.  Versatile,  The larger screen is easier to navigate the internet than the iPhone or Ipod.  But not as weighty as the ipad.!###Product as described and was shipped extremely fast! My new iPad mini was new in box and is up and running just perfectly! I am a very pleased customer!!###We gave this as a gift for an older uncle who only had used a desktop computer before.  He loves it and figured out how to use it right away.  Thanks!!###I rated the ipad with a 5 because its a great investment, I've  told all my friends about the ipad  due to the fact  it's Wi-Fi .keep up the good work thank you!###What can you say about Apple products, overall yes they are a tad pricey.But I think they still provide the best web browsing experience overall. I have several tablets (androids/IOS/Windows), so definitely not a fan boy. I just like the experience I get with some of their products. This one doesn't let me down, considering its the first generation iPad mini still handles just about everything I throw at it. The screen resolution for being a non-retina is actually quite good IMO. I saved a few $'s by getting an older model, but love the 64GB storage & cellular with Verizon.  This will definitely be my traveling companion, beats carrying the full size iPad around.!###Excellent device. Easy to connect to my AT&T service. Fast ship. Love the ease of using the MAC product and syncs with my laptop and iPhone seamlessly.!###I bought this for my 13 year old grandson and he loves it!  That's all this grandmother knows about it!!###Gave to my son for xmas. We have the full size ipad but he wanted the mini. He uses it nonstop for his games and its so handy to bring everywhere.!###Purchased for my mom. At first she thought it was too small when compared to my Ipad 2. Now she loves it. Works great, Apple makes great products.!###Great purchase! Battery life is great, screen size is great, all the best thing that Apple could offer. Overall a great buy,!###Nothing bad to say - does anything I need it to do and is very efficient.I wish the I-phone battery had the life that the iPad mini has.!###Bought this for my gf as an early Birthday present. First I had bought her the 16 gb but that was just not enough memory so returned it at Walmart and came on Amazon to get the 32 gb because the stores didn't carry anything but the 16. She loves it and has it with her all the time. It's fast, the screen resolution is amazing, all in all it's an amazing Tablet and Apple did a fine job! Have not encountered any problems whatsoever!!###Awesome ,the product is awesome, look brand new and everything works well. I just need to buy the screen protector and case for the back, the smart cover also looks brand new, it is indeed deserve my money!!###love love love it. I don't think words could describe how much I love this item. use it all the time.!###Why haven't I bought one of these earlier??  This is so much better than I had expected.  I use it all the time, and the screen quality, sound and usability is fantastic.  It does use the new Apple charger though...but whatever.  That's Apple's fault, not yours.!###The Apple Ipadmini is a great product, but the refurbished one we bought was defective.  Places on the screen would not work with touch.  The return process was great and friendly.  Apple products ARE better then the rest of pad wantabees out there.!###Fully functional iPad and a convenient size for travelling.  Apple products are still overpriced in general, but for the most part good tools.!###We purchased two iPad Minis last year. This unit provides hours of fun for kids and a larger viewing screen than the iPod. You can sync both devices, too. I feared this unit would make the kids abandon their iPods, but they didn't. They use both, because the iPad Mini is more fun to play games on, while the iPod is easier to transport.This unit came well-packaged, which was great to see when it arrived here.!###One of the reasons why I purchased the iPad was to play games on Facebook. It worked up until three days ago and now it doesn't. When I click on the game, it automatically goes to the home page. I am very frustrated! For that reason, I am sorry I got it.!###I gave this as a Christmas gift, and let me tell you, she absolutely is in love with it and can't stop thanking me enough (not a bad thing, eh?)  She has never had an iphone, ipod, laptop, or anything techno smart.  She uses it for emails, games, news, and searches.  Although it is a &#34;mini&#34; it's perfect for her.!###I have the Ipad 2 but didn't want my son on it, so this was perfect gift for him. Thanks!###I am addicted to the this device and in fact seldom use my laptop and desktop now. It is so compact and the perfect travel partner. Loaded with lots of cool features and so convenient. I highly recommend.!###My 10 year old granddaughter just sent me a text saying, &#34; this is the best present ever, I love it and I love you!&#34; She had been asking for the iPad mini since earlier this year so I decided to surprise her at Christmas. It amazes me how technically savvy kids are these days. She set the entire thing up by herself Christmas night. All of her games and contacts from her iPod came right over to the iPad mini. So easy and she's happy!!###Its simply APPLE what bad thing can you say.  Very light battery life is great and functions better than expected!###The iPad I received had been sent to VN as a gift to my friend. When she opened it, she found that the camera did not work. She finally had to contact Apple VN who agreed to exchange for another one.!###The Apple iPad mini MD531LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi, White / Silver) was exactly what I was looking for, but I did want the black as it was cheaper, however I would not have had that for XMas, and had to settle for the white. Works great transfer of info from iphone to ipad was easy.!###good video on how to use the ipad if you don't know how to use some of the features &lt;a href="http://7113dkyfxu912tc8t-ior4oe47.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=IPADVIDEO" target="_top">Click Here!&lt;/a>!###Mini pad is a Xmas gift @ I love it. Had an I touch, too small, wife has Ipad, but I love the Mini Pad. Easy to set up @ hold. Definitely  worth the $$$.  Apple. Is the best.!###This &#34;Mini&#34; was purchased for my grandson.  It has totally lived up to our expectations.  It has been easy to operate, and in our opinion was a great buy!  Thank you!###Fast Shipping!! Just as described! Great Communication! My daughter is going to love it! I wish I can keep it for myself but Santa might be mad!!###Bought this for my younger brother does all his homework, and gaming off it when he's not on his ps4 but definietely a plus!!!###It has all the functionality of a large tablet. It's light, compact, portable, and easy to carry. I find that this product fully lives up to the Apple logo and trademark.!###Exactly what I ordered! I love Amazon Prime!This iPad mini is exactly what my girlfriend wanted for Christmas. She's been using it non-stop.!###When the mini came out it was just what I wanted, an iPad thin and light enough to use comfortably wherever I needed. The 4G option is great if only for the built-in GPS which is missing in the Wifi version. This device is perfect for reading and carrying around with you wherever you go. It's also been supremely useful as a mobile tether when I've needed to work while out. It's also great to have the big screen for GPS/Waze when you are travelling rather than a mobile phone screen, you get to see a lot more context on the map. I have a retina iPhone and I really don't notice the lack of retina on my mini.Only thing I'd say is 16 gig is small if you want to take lots of photos or load up a few HD movies on it in addition to your music, games, apps etc.I think I'll change up to the retina mini 64 gig w/4G whenever I decide to upgrade, but I'm in no hurry, my mini is great :)!###Bought for my nine year old granddaughter.  Much more tech savey  than me.She thoroughly enjoys it.Provides her &#34;entertainment&#34; for hours.A good choice of programs and capabilitles.May get one for myself.Price appeared very competitive.!###This was a gift, so I just know that my son really likes it and has downloaded much of his smartphone info.I was impressed with such a fast delivery since it was so close to Christmas and timely delivery was notguaranteed.

Delivery was on time for Christmas.!###just what I expected-was happy to get it to help my daughter communicate with others with an app only for apple-!###I've had the Apple iPad mini for about 3 weeks now and in that time I've had nothing but problems with it. From a disturbingly common loss of battery charge after just a short time using it to problems with apps and videos. The iPad just doesn't work like it should and I'm really disappointed by that. I've had an iPad in the past and it worked excellently, so I know it's not the company in general because Apple has always had great technology, but this particular product is just severely disappointing.!###Great products and most affordable here. I went with Amazon to use my AMEX points for payment, everything went through smooth as silk, I was very popular on Christmas morning.!###I was very pleased at the timely receipt of my iPad mini! The item arrived carefully packaged and in great shape! My iPad works perfectly and we are very happy!!###Have other IPads and iPhones, chose this as a Christmas gift.

I would recommend this product to anyone. thank you!###My daughter LOVES this iPad. It's the perfect size and weight. I would definitely recommend any Apple product- this being another great one!!###As a lifelong (as in, the lifetime of the tablet) user of the large 9-10 inch tablets, i always assumed the smaller tablet market was futile.  I believed the tablets were too small to enjoy web browsing and media.  I didn't see a need for smaller screens because we had smartphones for that type of portability.  But when the iPad mini was deeply discounted at the release of the mini with retina I gave one a shot.  I must say that the mini is amazing.  I'm writing this review on my mini as my iPad air sits one foot away on the table next to my desktop computer.  The mini fills a void I never thought there was.  Its portable yet large enough to comfortably view the screen.  It fits in your large pockets and can easily be carried around.  Its small enough to type quickly on while being held.  It is simply a beautiful tablet that I wish I had purchased sooner.!###I love it  I  am on it all the time  it works great on what I use it for it's better than the big one!###It turns on and off easly, lights up nicely, all buttons click or press flawlessly.The glass face is smooth and turns black when off, like weird.The battery last as long as it lasts.Magnets do not adhere to the back as it is not steel.Just like a iPad but smaller.!###My daughter has not put it down, she uses it every chance she gets. Very happy with it alot alot!###Was a gift for someone special and they really liked the voice recognition for the schedulingI would recommend to anyone!###SO FAR, SO GOOD, WITH THIS IPAD OUR ONLY COMPLAINT SO FAR IS THERE WERE NO INSTRUCTIONS OF ANY KIND ENCLOSED WITH IT. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING DON'T YOU THINK? ONCE WE GOT IT GOING WE FIND IT WILL NOT TAKE A CHARGE. WE MAKE AN APPOINTMENT AT THE LOCAL APPLE STORE WHERE WE FIND OUT THE CHARGER CORD IS DEFECTIVE. WE GET A NEW ONE AND NOW IT WILL CHARGE. THEY TELL US THERE ARE SMALL CLASSES ON HOW TO USE THE IPAD BUT MY WIFE SAYS SHE CAN FIGURE IT OUT ON OUR OWN. IT TAKES GREAT PICTURES SO NOW WE HAVE ABOUT TEN DIFFERENT DEVICES THAT CAN TAKE PICTURES. SMILE!!###My daughter was very please with it. I would recommend this to my friend. I will buy this again, for myself.!###Sent to my sister for a Christmas gift and she is very satisfied.I'm thinking of sending one to my little sister for her birthday.!###Ordered this product for my daughter-in-law because she needed something smaller than a regular Ipad.

I like it because I can use it instead of my iphone all the time. I have a ipad 3 and i can say that I like the ipad mini better because of the size. I dont care if i have retnia display because i cant tell aa difference. I bought my ipad mini from target and the price was better than amazon. I like how light and small the product is. I used to have an android tablet but i am glad that i when with apple. The appstore has more apps and itunes too. I love my ipad mini and i recermend it. :)!###This is the second mini that I have bought for my kids to use in college.  They seem to like them as a way to access texts and other learning resources (as well as all of the entertainment available.)  I personally prefer the larger tablets but they seem to prefer the smaller size.  We've had a lot of experience with Apple products over the past few years (6 macbooks, 5 iphones, 3 ipads, apple TV) and all have been well-built and reliable.  The cost may be higher than similar products but the reliability has been worth it.!###Great Christmas present, daughter loves it, especially talking to Suri. We have 3 different tablets in our house, I like this one the best.!###As always Apple products are the best. Gave the IPad Mini to my grown daughter for Christmas. Said it was best gift I could have given her.  Arrived within a very few days of ordering.!###This was a gift and was most welcomed and now in full use. A great purchase for everyone. I have all Apple products and swear by them. You just cannot go wrong with Apple. The help and service is unquestionably the best you can get. I praise Apple and all that they come out with.  Go for it treat yourself to the best product you could buy.!###It's really good. My mom loves it. I got it for her for Christmas. Me and my brother put the money in for it.!###Got this for our daughter to use for her flight plans as she becomes a private pilot.  Works great for all the apps!!!###Purchased for my wife, she loves it. Color, clarity and ease of use have her saying, &#34; maybe I'm getting to understand how to use these things.&#34;!###Extremely portable, fits easily in a handbag. The smaller screen is surprisingly easy to use. Lots of great apps for all ages and abilities.!###I love it!!!I bought a wireless keyboard for it and downloaded apps to allow me to login for work should I need to with it. So I love it more than I thought I would.!###Bought for my son as a Christmas gift. He does a lot of traveling and finds it the perfect way to FaceTime his young children, while away.!###Ordererd iPad mini, shipped fast.  Does what a iPad should do.  Only concern was how it was packaged for shipping,  would have felt more piece of mind to have foam inserts to protect the ipad and box, other than that still 5*!###For my use, this iPad mini is perfect. The wireless & bluetooth capabilities free me up from my computer desktop at home (which was my intent). Since I already have an iPhone, this was a breeze to learn and navigate. Why pay extra for the retina screen? I didn't and feel the resolution is great for my needs. I read all the reviews before selecting my first tablet and and thrilled with this one.Admittedly I have not taken the iPad outside to test with my wireless network - I bought it for home use anyway. However I know a lot of people carry those things everywhere (not me).!###Does everything my big one does and is much lighter, great for travelling and for little hands.  What more can I say!!###This price point could not be beat (saved more than $200) and it's refurbished condition was as NEW!  Love it!  So much bigger than i-phone screen and not as heavy as regular i-pad.  Highly recommended.  Shipped faster than originally quoted!!###I am enjoying the iPad mini.  It was easy to setup and i like the mobility of this device.  I would recommend this device!###Love the mini ipad It does amazing things. Clear tone. Dont know how I lived without it. You must get one.!###I love the iPad Mini so much that my sisters and I bought one for my mom and she loves it!!!You can't go wrong with giving this as a gift!!!!###This product is a high quality, yet made with thin material and fits perfectly. It also looks very nice, love the product vet much and been recommending it to others daily!!###It does everything I need and then some!!  I think this is one of the greatest gifts I ever received for Christmas.  Thank Mom & Dad!###Purchased this as a gift for my husband who was excited and ready to use it as soon as he tore the wrapping paper off.  However, the initial set up was very difficult.  The initial swipe to start option when you first turn it on wouldn't work, so we were stuck with the multi-language &#34;hello&#34; prompt for the first day of trying to get it to work.  Finally once we got past that, all of the instructions were in Russian.  I researched various iPad initial start up demos and it wasn't supposed to be this difficult or frustrating to get going with a brand new iPad.  I actually tried to look up the seller info for assistance or to return it. Finally with a phone call to my sister, she talked me through how to reset it to original factory settings, and we were able to get set up going in English!###the iPad is the coolest ever!!!. very user friendly and easy to understand how tobusebit right out of the box!###This was a Christmas present for our 10 year old. He loved it. It is a great product and the perfect size for him. Of course, since he was thrilled, we are as well.!###
!###*** UPDATE ***********************************************************************************************************Bought mine from google play and just to drive the point, this phone is much cheaper when bought via google directly. There maybe some wait (a couple of weeks) while buying via google play, but the wait saves you a hundred dollars or more. Its your pick!**Update September/2013 ***The pricing difference between amazon and google play isn't as significant as it was when the phone was launched in late 2012.Still enjoying the phone, the battery still runs good, the screen hasn't had any scratches and it still feels almost like a new phone. Guess I ll be skipping the upgrade this November and maybe buy a Nexus 10 instead :-)**********************************************************************************************************Ever since the concept of smartphones came out, there has been a talk of this so called 'convergence'; Wherein you own one device which can practically do everything under the sun. With the Nexus-4, I think the so called convergence is here, well almost. The only thing that is still lacking is the camera, since I don't see it replacing my DSLR (or even a really good point & shoot). Of course, this shouldn't be taken as a negative point for the phone since I don't think there isn't any other phone which could do the same (The IOS religious fanatics would disagree, but I don't think the Iphone camera comes close to DSLR quality either). Apart from that, the phone does perform rather well in all the other departments. Jellybean is the best Android flavor so far, the UI is great, the experience is smooth and apps in the google play store are abundant. Battery life is decent, engine horse power is phenomenal (Thanks to Qcom) and the Network data speeds are great. A brief summary of points follows:a) LTE or Not! : The phone doesn't support LTE, but supports HSPA+ which some (T-mobile) still tout as 4G. If you are on T-mobile, getting the phone is a no brainer, since you will get the best speeds that their network can provide. AT&T is a different story, AT&T supports both HSPA+ and 4g LTE. It has been stated by multiple reviewers that AT&T's LTE is much faster than their HSPA+ network (this makes logical sense since for AT&T LTE is the latest buzzword and they probably want to promote it over HSPA+). The other fact is that AT&T's HSPA+ is slower than T-mobile's HSPA+ network and it is suggested that T-mobile's HSPA+ may be comparable to AT&T's LTE. To keep it short, this phone will give you the best experience on T-mobile although you should be able to get decent speeds on AT&T as well. (The phone won't work on Verizon or other CDMA networks).b) Cost of the phone: I purchased mine from google where it retails for a standard price of $350 (plus taxes and shipping). Some people may compare this price to the contract price of an iphone (or other android smart phones), but that's not a fair comparison. Most contracts factor in the cost of the phone in the plan and by rough estimates an average customer pays around 20$/month for getting the phone subsidized. Multiply this by 24 for a 2 year contract and you are paying 480$ over a 2 year cycle and that's over & above the initial downpayment of 200$. That's a total price of 680$!! T-mobile for sure gives you a discount if you opt out of the phone and other carriers may have similar plans. The other thing which adds to  your monthly payments is the tax on wireless plans. In the great state of Texas the monthly tax for cell phone plans comes to 17%. So if you have a monthly plan which is higher in cost, you also end up paying higher tax on it. (Compare this with 8% sales tax that you pay when you buy the device up front. Even if you assume that the total cost of the device to the customer is the same, whether purchased via contract or by full downpayment, the contract options leads to a higher tax on the buyer. Ofcourse, the contract plans never really disclose the full picture so you never get to do the maths).c) Connecting to a TV: The Nexus 4 doesn't have a mini HDMI, what it does have is a micro usb which supports slimport. You can buy a slimport HDMI adapter for under 30$ and connect your Nexus 4 to your TV (In contrast to the Nexus 7 tablet which purportedly doesn't support slimport). The other emerging standard is 'Miracast' which would enable one to wirelessly stream the display to a Miracast enabled TV. (Don't worry if you have an older generation TV, the market will be soon be seeing a flood of Miracast adapters which can convert an old TV into Miracast compliant using the HDMI port).Once the connection to TV is sorted out, I think the phone can work as a good replacement to a gaming console or a streaming device. You can play high quality games (and the games on google play are much cheaper than their console brethren)or watch movies/tv on Netflix.The only drawback, there won't be Amazon prime instant videos on this. You can watch Amazon instant videos using the browser of the phone, but Amazon doesn't allow instant videos to be displayed in HD on Android devices. (It does allow that on IOS or custom devices which support the amazon app or on the kindle fire). I guess that's just Amazon's marketing strategy.d) Camera: The camera is decent, comes with an led flash, but isn't something that would blow my mind away.Overall, it's a very good phone at an amazing price point. No wonder it's sold out on google and selling at a premium on Amazon. I will continue updating the review as I spend more time with the phone. Do check back later and if you find the review helpful, please vote on the helpful review button. (It gives me the much needed encouragement to take time off from my busy work schedule and write lengthy reviews)***Update***I have had this phone for a few days now and I'm quite satisfied. There are a couple of points to note though, the phone does have a tendency to slip out of one's hands (it maybe the larger size and slippery surfaces), so a protective case is necessary. I use the SF Matte Black - Rearth Ringke SLIM for LG Google Nexus 4 Soft Feeling Premium Hard Case - ECO Package [Revised Version] case. It's a hard back case with a soft feel and covers the back and the sides. It's slim enough to be unnoticeable, however unlike the google certified nexus 4 bumper, this one does cover the beautiful back of the phone. It's also slightly loose around the volume button, but at half the cost of the google nexus 4 bumper and available without delay, its not a bad deal.Camera Quality: People have commented on comparing the camera quality of this vis-a-vis the iphone-5. I haven't had time to do tests myself, but on doing some research online, it is suggested that the Iphone5 camera is perhaps slightly better than the one on this. This is particularly more for color tint and saturation than for the actual sharpness of the image. I believe this is nothing that cannot be fixed by future software updates.***Update-2 : Feb/2013 **The camera app is noticeably buggy. In some cases I have seen that the blue camera button refuses to work till you exit the camera app and restart it again. I've also had the flash freeze while it's on. Issues are not that frequent and easily resolvable, but this now appears to be a genuine bug on Android Jelly Bean. I hope google has a fix soon, it can be a source of potential embarrassment when it hits as you are trying to show it off to the iphone cult!Some other points which I've noticed which are plus points for the Nexus 4:  a) Wireless charging support; No official charger is out there yet, but some models which support the nexus 4 exist. It's much more convenient to just place the phone on a charging mat/surface rather than plugging it in.  b) NFC tags: The phone supports NFC. There isn't much commercial use of it till now (NFC payments hasn't really kicked in), but there are some nice things you can do with NFC tags. For around 15$ you can buy a set of 15 tags which can then be customized such that the Nexus performs a specific action when it's near them. (For instance you can program and stick a tag in your car, such that when you enter the car, the bluetooth and gps is automatically turned on and the wifi is turned off. Helps in extending battery life by switching the appropriate antennas at the right time). More on these later, when I actually get to try them out.**** Update-3: 20/Feb/2013 **With the latest upgrade of JellyBean, the camera bug seems to be resolved. I haven't seen it in a while now.                    The Nexus4 is priced at $349 for 16GB through Google's site.  [...] The phones are ALL made un-locked (there is no locked version because there is no carrier associated).  My husband put in his SIM card from his iphone and after about 20min it recognized his new device.The phones are amazing.  Very happy - but I just wanted to bring it to anyone looking at this listing, how overpriced this store is listing them.We simply waited for the opportunity to get on backorder - and then three weeks after that we received our phones.  It doesn't hurt to wait sometimes.  The phone is worth it, and so is the money you will save.                    I bought my Nexus 4 from Google for $350. It tool about three hours of retrying on there web page. When I ordered it said it would ship in two to three weeks but it was on my door step in two.My last phone was an IPhone 4 on AT&T. I just shut it down removed the SIM, inserted the SIM in the Nexus 4 and started it. That was all there was to it, no calls to support or fiddling with setting, it just worked. The screen is great and the GUI is super smooth. I did find I had to buy two apps. Air Play by Double Twist allows the phone to wirelessly sync play lists with Itunes on my iMAC.  HD Widgets allows the creation nice custom widgets to manage bluetooth, Wifi and ringer settings. I have had this phone for almost two weeks and the more I use the phone the more I like it. It is much easier to manage my apps and track down which is doing what in the background. At first I thought the battery might be an issue but that seems to be getting better, I got rid of Yahoo Weather and that helped a lot, it pounds the network and GPS constantly. Signal strength is at least and good as the IPhone 4 with WiFi and 3G and way better with bluetooth. The phone works well and there have been no issues with hearing or being heard. The camer works well and takes nice pictures but i don't thing it is as good as the IPhone 4s or 5. The flash is much more powerful then the one on my IPhone 4.The stock phone is a bit slippery and there are very few cases available thus far. I tried a soft TPU case which fit fine but felt crappy so when the Google Nexus 4 bumper came back in stock I got one of those. The bumper from Google is way nicer than I expected. It has a real metal band around the outside and the buttons work and feel even better than the stock phone buttons. The bumper makes the phone very easy to hold on to and has metal around the USB and headphone jacks that make plugs easier to find without looking without preventing any plug I have tried from being fully inserting.I have no regrets about switching and have no plan to go back.                    Just some background,I am coming from the original Galaxy S i9000, which was the flagship phone of 2010I was eagerly awaiting the next nexus device for quite a few months. My previous phone had its screen cracked from a fall around July, and overall, I was starting to get anxious to be back with the latest and greatest, instead of being stuck with a 2+ year old phone.I just received the phone yesterday evening, so essentially, these points are from the perspective of someone who has been using the phone for less than a day.ProsThe build quality of the phone is great.It feels like a premium device, despite its no-nonsense, straightforward look. Essentially, the out of box feel was a very pleasant one. This is, of course, a subjective point, but several other friends and co-workers had the same reaction to seeing the physical device, so I think it's safe to say that my opinion on the build quality isn't unique.Large memory means apps stay open.This device has 2 GB of memory. What that means in real world usage is that recently used apps don't seem to close that often. On my old phone, if I was browsing the web, switched to the Message app to send a text, switch to a couple other applications to do other things and then switched back to the browser, the browser would have to reload the page because the other applications kicked it out from memory. That doesn't really happen on this phone. I can't speak for games that are generally larger and take up a lot more memory, but I had up to 20 apps `open' at one point, and was able to quickly switch between them without any of them having to reload.That leads to the second observation...Everything is quickThis is partly due to the specs of the device - it has a high end quad core processor and gpu so things generally load up very quickly. But also, because of the large memory, most things don't have to reload if you switch to some other task and switch back, so it makes multi-tasking a remarkably quick and enjoyable affair.Screen is beautifulThe applications seem to sit directly on the screen, rather than behind it, due to the very little space between the screen and the glass. Coming from a device with an Amoled screen, at first the colours seemed washed out, but after a few hours of allowing your eyes to adjust, you appreciate the beauty of the more natural looking colours, and amoled screens seem loud and over-colorful in comparison.ConsNo expandable memoryThis concerns me just a little, but I had a 16gig sd card in my old Galaxy S, and I simply never used used it. At all. And that phone had 8GB of internal memory, so I think I will be ok. But this is the one issue that has me just a tiny bit uneasyUnlock key hard to reach for a left hander - big annoyance. I know the majority of the world is right handed, but I got used to holding my old phone in my left hand with every button within easy reach due to the size of the device. With the nexus 4, somehow, hitting that power button is just a little bit too difficult to do one-handed.... Not impossible, mind you, but difficult enough that I notice it. This issue may become a non-issue with time as I get used to the device, but it's worth mentioning for any potential left-handed buyers.The size of the screen is also just a little too big to comfortably use one handed, which again, I will probably get used to, but is annoying enough that I notice it a lot. This isn't only a negative though, because I enjoy the size of the screen when it comes to actually looking at and using the device and would probably appreciate an even bigger one. So, this annoyance is something I'm comfortable ignoring since I prefer the added screen real estate.No toggle widgets in the notification tray (WiFi, GPS, etc)They are reachable via shortcuts, but it would be nice to simply have a simple toggle switch right there in the notification tray. This is not a big deal, just a minor annoyance, but worth pointing out.Battery life doesn't seem fantasticI can't speak for how well the phone really performs battery-wise until I've used it for a couple of weeks, but the initial experience with the battery usage is a bit underwhelming. I'm assuming that once the battery meter is properly calibrated, this will noticeably improve though, so I will update this portion of the review in 2 or 3 weeks.Finally, no LTEThis is a non-issue for me, since LTE is not available in my area, but it is worth pointing out for those that have that option that may be disappointed by this news.Upon looking at the review, one may get the impression that this is a negative review of the Nexus 4. It's not. The performance of this thing is top notch and makes using the phone an absolute pleasure. Everything just works, and coming from the Galaxy S, where the GPS never worked reliably and the I/O performance was flaky resulting in random hiccups in the user interface, it's definitely been a huge pleasure to switch to this device.I can't say that it is a device without compromises, but the performance of it makes the tradeoffs of no LTE or expandable storage a no-brainer decision for myself.  Unless LTE is important, or you know that 16 GB is just not enough storage, I cannot recommend this device any more heartily.Update: Looking back after 2 months of use, without a doubt, this was a great purchase.It is well performing device, and does it so effortlessly that i no longer even notice how well it performs, until i use another phone as a comparison point.The size of the device no longer bothers me - after spending some time with it, i can now comfortably use it one-handed, and do so 90% of the time.The power button issue also has gone away as i've gotten used to its location and how best to reach it while holding the phone one-handed.Up until last week, the battery life was still nothing to talk about, but the recent update to 4.2.2 seems to have changed that in a very positive way. I generally unplug my phone around 6 am in the morning, and usually, i would plug it back in to charge for an hour or so at some point during the day to ensure it will last for my 30 minute walk home. This week, after getting the update, i seem to be getting home comfortably with about 30% battery remaining, without that midday charge, which is great. So, if that holds up, the battery life will also cease to be an issue.                    I own this phone, but I bought it from the Google Play Store. The prices from resellers are ridiculous! It goes for $349 before tax and shipping. Don't even think about paying more than $400 for this device. Yes, it is worth a lot more, but I'd allow for Google to get their stock back up from LG before considering purchasing.1. Build Quality: This is without a doubt the most comfortable phone I have ever held. It's glass front and back sandwiching a smooth grippy edging makes for one enjoyable handholding experience. It's not too light and not too heavy. It is a little wide if you use a bumper, but on it's own it feels really good in average to large-size hands. The curved front is extremely smooth and once you swipe across it a few times, you will never want to go back. It's that good. I will say though that the phone gets HOT when downloading a lot of videos, and gets pretty warm when playing games for an extended period of time. If the back were made out of plastic it would be less of a problem- I guess you are trading off practicality for elegance that situation. The faint checkered back breaks up the "black slab" appearance of the phone, and looks good, but it's not a game-changer. WIth the glass back, the tapered edges, and the grippy sides, you'll be tempted to NOT own a case.  This is one elegant phone! Just don't drop it. Glass breaks.2. Android 4.2 -  Enough has been said about Android. If you're looking at this device, then you probably already know that this OS is the most flexible, and powerful OS around. The difference is that you get fast updates vs. other Android phones, and it is VERY stable and crashes less than any other phone I've used. The phone is extremely smooth and I have yet to see lag, even with multiple widgets on several screens. . Even though Photosphere panorama is cool, you won't find yourself using it much. Google Now is a really useful tool once you have it set up correctly (it can seem to read your mind), and the new camera filters and editing options are awesome. I think they dropped the ball with the lock screen widgets since you can only set up 1 per swipe/screen, and very few widgets are actually supported. Facial unlock is super-fast now and is my preferred way of securing and unlocking my phone now. The clock app is greatly improved with adding back the timer and stopwatch that were missing from previous builds. You can even set world times. The quick setting shade is NOT as useful as just dropping a toggle widget on the screen, but some people may prefer the option.  Android 4.2 is SMOOOOOOTHH and buttery. The stock calendar app & widget blows every other calendar app and widget out of the water.3. Cameras- The camera is not all that great. Even though it is 8mp shooter, the pics come out grainy and not much better than the Galaxy Nexus. Video looks good and the audio recording sounds solid. The front facing camera underperforms significantly- even though it is 1.3mp. One bug that is still there is if you have a Picasa account set up and a Google Plus account, it will duplicate photo folders pretty horrendously. That's more Android's fault than the camera, but it is a unique problem for Nexus phones. I'd say pictures taken on the N4 are at best 20% better the GNexus.4. Speaker- The speakerphone sounds pretty good. It still has that tinny smartphone sound with a lack of bass, but that's par for the course. It's much louder than the Galaxy Nexus. Calls sound crisp and clean.5. NFC- I'm just now getting into using NFC. Radioshack, Macy's, Old Navy, OfficeMax and many other stores can take Google Wallet's "tap and pay" service. What I think you will get more millage out of is by using NFC tags. You can get them on Amazon. Basically you can set up spots in you home/car/work where you can tap the phone and have useful profiles activate. Check out CNET or Youtube to see how you might use them. If another family member or friend has NFC, you can easily share stuff by holding the phones together. It's MUCH faster and efficient than "Bump" and bluetooth.6. The screen- The screen is absolutely gorgeous! It is bright and colorful. Very accurate images. Since it is a 720p 320ppi screen, you have to stare very closely to see any pixels. Basically, you need a microscope to see any jagged edges. Letters are extremely sharp and clear. The only issues are that if you are coming from an AMOLED phone like the Galaxy Nexus, the blacks aren't nearly as deep and you will notice it. Also, the screen gets washed out a bit when viewing from the side, rather than maintaining contrast.7. Battery life. The phone will last you a day with light use (quick use of apps/widgets and plenty of texting/Facebook, with live wallpapers ON), 9 hours with moderate use (a few calls, some extended app use, and a GPS mapping trip), and 5 hours with heavy downloading, photo taking, and gameplaying. Better than the Galaxy Nexus.8. Multicolored Notification light- Good in theory, but Android doesn't use it well and the LightFlow app is still not reaching it's potential.9. HSPA+ 42. This is a 4G phone. Don't believe the techsnobs who try to act as if this is "3G+" or some such nonsense. On T-Mobile this phone flies, and downloads at speeds 6 times faster than what you would get with a 3G phone. I get an average of 12mbps and higher in good reception spots. That's fast enough to download most apps in a couple of seconds, and to play 1080p HD video with no lag or stuttering whatsoever. Is it as fast as LTE? No, but depending on where you are, it can be just as fast, with no additional battery drain. Also, the Nexus 4 has an LTE antenna which can use T-Mobile's AWS bands when they are repurposed for LTE this year (2013). That won't help you if you are on ATT, since ATT uses a different frequency for their LTE. When T-Mobile lights up LTE in your city, Google "Configure Your Nexus 4 for LTE Access Point" and you'll have access to their LTE.The bottom line is that it's not a perfect phone, but the phone is amazing regardless, and the best phone on the market right now. The only thing I miss is the lacking expandable memory of phones like the GS3.                    OK.. So like everyone else on here, I bought mine directly from the Google Play Store. As mentioned - it is quite a bit cheaper there. And now that they have gotten past the original supply shortages, you can order your phone and have it in hand by the end of the week. Maybe not Amazon Prime fast - but what is? :-)I've had this phone for a little over a month and can honestly say its the best phone I've ever had - maybe even the best piece of technology period. And for the price (even if you buy through Amazon), you will not find a better device. Not only are the specs incredible (quad-core processor, 2gb ram, etc).. but pure android is a joy to use. Especially since Google's project butter smoothed things out. Prior to that, pure android still had some weird lag (maybe not the right word for it) when navigating the phone. No such problems here however.The are only a couple of drawbacks to this phone that I would communicate to those looking to buy. These weren't issues for me, but I know some others might want/expect these features.1. No memory card expansion. If you are an android user, chances are you have a device that you can insert a memory card into. This phone does not have that. This is not an issue for me because all of my media (music, pics, docs) are stored in their respective cloud containers (google music, google+, google drive). But for those that prefer to keep things off the cloud, you will find 16gb might not be enough storage. Totally a preference thing but worth noting nonetheless.2. No LTE (sort of). The phone technically speaking is capable of 4g LTE and, before the 4.2.2 version of Jelly Bean, their were some nerds - I use this term affectionately - that were able to mod the phone to connect to LTE. Otherwise, the fastest network you can connect to is T-Mobile's HSPA+. If you think you need LTE, you are just being picky. HSPA+ is plenty fast depending on where you live, which of course holds true for LTE as well. I regularly get download speeds of 15kbps and up on HSPA+.. and the network is very fast - im not sure I'd be able to tell the difference in day to day usage (maybe only when downloading movies and other large files).All that said - I have a $30/mo plan with T-mobile that give me unlimited data (first 5gb at HSPA+), unlimited text, and 100 minutes per month. I user skype to get around the minutes issue so 100 is plenty.Bottom Line:Do your self a favor and buy this phone for $350 and go to T-Mobile and get the $30 prepaid plan. You'll get a fast network on a ridiculous phone (has brains and beauty) without having to give your first born to Verizon/AT&T for something that the average user won't actually need.God Speed.                    First and foremost, as other reviewers have mentioned: do not buy this phone from Amazon as it costs less buying directly from Google play.  Also, this review will be long and somewhat incoherent, but I'll try my best to cover as much as I can about this phone.A little bit of information about me, I am a computer hobbyist whose first venture into the realm of smart phones is the Nexus 4.  Yes, it's been a long time coming, but I've never felt compelled to join the ranks of mobile tech enthusiasts until now, and the reason boils mainly down to the fact that the Nexus 4 is, at least in my opinion, the best bang for the buck you can get within the vast selection of Android smartphones out there.The hardware, even now, is still top of the line when it comes to the combination of processor, GPU, and the 2GB RAM.  It's far ahead of its time relative to the software optimized for it, given the fact that the iPhone 5 can match and even exceed the Nexus 4 in various benchmarks, despite the iPhone 5 having inferior hardware and less RAM.  Therefore, people who opt to purchase this phone won't find it crucial to move up to the next one for quite some time, unless they want the absolute bleeding edge of technology.  One important thing to note is that, because smartphones in general lack any sort of self-cooling system or even a heatsink to quickly disperse the heat elsewhere, doing CPU and GPU intensive tasks will heat the phone up quickly and can cause system throttling, which lowers the performance of the phone in order to preserve the life span of the components and the battery.The built in microphone quality, as far as phone calls goes, has been clear enough for my purposes.  I don't expect too much out of microphones, and this one has not disappointed me yet in conversational clarity.  For video sound capture, however, it seems a bit unsuited for expeditious recording, but may be adequate for stationary recording.  Being on the T-mobile Unlimited Plan, myself, I found the data speeds to be more than adequate and the Wi-Fi reception to be comparable to that of laptop quality.  The Nexus 4 has a dual band HSPA+ 42 which means that it transfers data from two towers at once, obviously making the signal much stronger and more consistent than single band.  Finally, the screen quality represents the same level of clarity as my desktop LCD, as far as I can observe, which is impressive by my standards.On the subject of operating systems, the Nexus 4 separates itself from the Android competition by being first in line for Android updates.  This is because the other manufacturers who advertise their own features to the Android operating system, such as Samsung and its Touch Wiz, have to take time and implement their own features with each and every update.  As a result, nearly all of the other phones must wait a few months to receive the latest updates, which may or not be of great concern to the general smartphone consumer.  It is also important to note that Android smartphone users are free to format their phones and implement whichever version of Android they please, modded or otherwise, but doing so is not for the faint of heart.  Incidentally, I've noticed that the Nexus 4 snappiness is slightly, but noticeably smoother than the Samsung variants I've demo'd so far.  One potential downside is that Nexus 4's Android OS, more commonly known as "stock android", is  somewhat less user friendly than the flavors of Android that are reworked for the purposes of other Android smartphone manufacturers, which has perhaps, in part, lead to the Nexus 4 being dubbed "the Android developer's phone".The build quality, as noted by other reviewers in ambivalence, has style more in mind than durability.  Both the back and the front appear to be gorilla glass (though I could be wrong on this), but the back glass lacks the oleophobic coating that is, in actuality, what deters scratches and fingerprints, not the glass itself.  The oleophobic coating is a very thin layer whose presence is known by the slickness that gradually fades as the coating wears away over time and wear.  The good news is that, for those who don't want to purchase screen protectors and enjoy the slick feeling of the coating, there are oleophobic coating replacement kits on Amazon that have enough supply to very quickly and easily reinforce the coating for months and months.  However, I would personally recommend not only a screen protector (since they last longer and add additional, albeit slight, shock protection to the screen and usually don't require replacements), but also a durable protective case, since the glassy nature of the Nexus 4 puts smartphone care on the difficulty level of hard mode.As far as unlocked phones go, and they're rather taboo nowadays due to the silly for-profit legislation, the Nexus 4 is priced far lower than its competition.  And while $299 for the 8GB version and $350 (prices may vary in the future) for the 16GB version seem like very tempting deals, there are some general consumer expectations that this phone meets and does not meet.The battery life, for me, was very manageable.  Of course, it must be said that I am a moderate user, with the knowledge that screen brightness and just having the screen on drains the battery more than anything else one could possibly be doing with it.  It is important to note that there are programs that one can find in the app store for free that can assist in managing the phone's battery life, especially ones that put the phone into deep sleep when the phone is off.  People may often wonder why their batteries drain so quickly outside of active use, and this is often due to background programs continuously utilizing the CPU and consequently draining the battery.  A bit of research can go a long way, as the greater freedom of Android also comes with it a greater chance to find ourselves in unfavorable scenarios if we're not careful.  It may take a some fine tuning, but the time, effort and results are worth it.  I have been able to get through an entire waking day, with a total on-screen time of about an hour and a half watching YouTube videos and checking e-mail down to about 50%.  To me, that's more than reasonable as far as smartphone battery life is concerned.One major downside of the Nexus 4, at least in my opinion, is that it does not have an expansion slot for memory cards.  This is can be a make or break aspect for those of us who like to have a large repertoire of music and video files at the ready without having to rely on data plans to stream them for us.  When queried for an answer as to why this feature was not implemented, a Google representative said something to the extent of SD cards being an archaic technology and some other condescending nonsense.  I found it more comical than anything else that the attitude in response to a legitimate question was one of arrogance, rather than acceptance of one's failure of awareness to consumer demand.Another meaningful downside is that if you are in the market for a smartphone that will effectively double as your camera, the Nexus is not the best that Android phones have to offer, but it is sufficient in a pinch.  From my experience, it's been rather difficult to tame the consistency of photo quality.  Video capture quality was fine for my purposes, but the sound capture, as mentioned before, was rather mediocre.Finally, there are a few more issues with this phone that are less egregious but are nevertheless meaningful to a select group of people.One is that micro-USB OTG, known as "on-the-go" was initially advertised as supported, but now the Nexus 4 manufacturers have recanted this as a "mistake" after its purchasers discovered otherwise.  For those who are unsure of what the feature is, OTG support allows us to power certain devices out of the charging port of the phone, provided that we have the appropriate conversion cables and that the phone can supply enough voltage to whatever is being connected.  For instance, with OTG support, we would be able to connect things like keyboards, mice, gaming controllers, and even thumb drives at the obvious expense of less battery life.Another issue is that the Nexus 4 doesn't seem to handle wired headsets with as much grace as other phones.  I only mean to emphasize that this goes for *wired* headsets and not Bluetooth ones.  Whether it is a hardware or software problem is outside the realm of my current scope of knowledge about the phone, but the problem seems to be that the volume adjustment affects the strength of the microphone gain.  Thus, if you want the volume to be low, the microphone will be accordingly weak.  This can be, in actuality, an extremely significant issue for people who are accustomed to making phone calls with wired headsets, since it forces us to blast our ears out with the highest volume only to render the microphone useful.  This may be fixed in subsequent updates, but, honestly, this should not even be an issue to begin with in the current generation of phones.UPDATE: It seems that newer batches of this phone have the microphone gain issue corrected, so if yours does this, LG/Google will likely accept your RMA request and have a new unit sent to you.Update #2: It seems that Android 4.3 has remedied this issue to a great extent for the remaining phones out there that still have this issue.Finally, there is no legally accessible LTE support, for those who are looking into jumping on that bandwagon.  For those of you who do not know, LTE stands for "long term evolution" and it is, at least of this writing, the fastest method of data transfer between phone and phone service.  One can also purchase USB dongles (yes get your giggles out) to plug into our laptops or, if desired, desktop computers as other means of using 4G LTE on more powerful but less portable work or play stations.  While the speeds are indeed impressive, with people able to achieve 175 megabits per second (translates to 175/8 or nearly 20 megabytes per second, statistics gathered from a Google search of the terms "4G LTE speedtest") the coverage seems to be rather sparse, limited to only a a few carriers, two being AT&T and Verizon, and mainly within the most metropolitan of cities in the USA.  Not only that, but 4G LTE seems to make battery power management a bit more cumbersome.  Now, there would be great uses for 4G LTE in terms of using one's phone as a tethering device, which means that other devices, such as a laptop or desktop computer, would connect with your phone's 4G LTE service to gain Internet access that way.  Also, in areas where 4G LTE is prevalent, one could quite literally video chat on the fly, which is quite handy for the extreme mobile tech enthusiasts among us.  While I've been able to achieve about 10-20 megabits per second in data transfer speed with my HSPA+ data plan, which translates to roughly 1-2 megabytes per second, it's honestly generous enough for all of my applications, whether it be streaming YouTube videos or Spotify/MOG music, but may not be consistent enough for video chatting on the move.  For those that can afford it and want near-seamless access to the Internet through their wireless phone service, it might affect their decision to opt with this phone or another one that has FCC licensing for general consumer use of 4G LTE.Overall, I think the Nexus 4, despite its caveats, is the best bang for the buck as far as Android phones are concerned.  For the budget-conscious buyers who want top of the line processor and GPU, this is the phone to get.  For those who don't mind that there is no expansion slot and only 16GB max of onboard memory and want the snappiest possible Android experience, this is the phone to get.  For those of us who want an hacker-friendly device that's free from the clutches of carrier restrictions, this is the phone to get.As I learn more about this phone, I'll continue updating or altering parts of this review.  Thanks for reading.                    O.K. This is my first "Smart Phone".  Yes, I had a "Blackberry 8820" which could, sort of, go on the web.  It would lock up if I went anywhere except a few websites that were o.k.The difference between the Nexus 4 and the Blackberry is about like the difference between a 1962 VW bug and a 2011 Porsche Targa.  The Nexus 4 does everything with such smooth silkiness that it is a dream come true.  Everything works.  I never "downloaded" an "app" until now, but it is so easy, like falling off a log.I have created a Google list of people by uploading my Outlook contact list to the Google website, and instantly, all the contacts are available in the new Nexus 4.  Incidentally, I've had the Nexus 4 for about a week now.I've answered email, placed stock buys, sent SMS txt messages, bought stuff on Amazon, and generally had a really fun time with this phone!You will have to have some patience dealing with Google Play store.  They were the worst buying experience I ever had.  However, the phone is so good, I don't really mind.  Expect delays of a month or more to get the phone.  Go to Walmart and buy a $10 dollar phone to tide you over if you need something right away.  This phone is worth the wait.Also, regarding the business of lack of LTE, I haven't noticed anything.  If the phone gets a signal, the data rates are plenty fast for me to watch U tube videos, play Pandora, etc.  If not, then I get nothing at all.  Usually, it simply works.Also, regarding 8 Gbytes of memory vs 16 Gbytes, I bought the 16 Gbyte because every review I read strongly encouraged that.  However, I still have about 11 Gbytes free and don't anticipate getting anywhere near to using all this memory.  Perhaps I'm just used to the 8820 blackberry and haven't figured out how to consume memory in large chunks yet.  If you bought the 8 Gbyte model, be happy, it's fine.I love the phone and would recommend it to anyone, but only at the $ three hundred and fifty dollar price directly from Google.Addendum 12 29 2012:  I should have mentioned something about the cell phone provider that I use.  It is T-Mobile, their $30 a month plan for 5 Gbytes of data + 100 free minutes + unlimited texting.  This is a prepaid plan, which required some negotiation with T-Mobile because I was already with them prior to getting this plan.  If you look at the fine print, they have this plan for new customers only.  I simply explained to them that it wouldn't be a problem if they couldn't provide that plan to me as Virgin Mobile had a similar plan for $35 a month but included 300 minutes.  So long T-Mobile, but the gentlemen quickly said "wait a minute" we can provide you with you want, no need to switch.This is what an "unlocked" phone is all about:  NO MORE $60 or $80 or $100 a month plans.  Don't spend money on cell phones if you haven't bought a house yet.  Live "below your means".O.K.  enough of my soapbox,... sorry...                    I have to warn you that I am a fan of Pure Android, I don't feel there is a better Mobile OS out at this time as most lack some features that Android clearly has.  With that out of the way, let me say I've been using this phone for about 3 days now as I managed to score one when they went back in stock on the play store.BUILD QUALITY The phone itself seems very solid, It features a rubberize metal frame with Gorilla Glass 2 front and back plates.  The phone is built much like the iPhone 4 and 4s line and like those phones the Nexus 4 also features a non-removable battery.  No real complaints over all with the build quality.SPECIAL FEATURES  The three biggest features the phone adds, in my opinion, are NFC with Google Wallet support, Wireless Charging, and Wireless display / Mirracast (this might be the first Google Device with Airplay style Screen Redirection).Google claims that 200,000 locations are now equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) and setup to use their wallet for payment services.  I haven't seen one yet but, I haven't really activated Google Wallet yet either.Wireless Charging is really cool but, as of right now the optional accessories required for the feature are pretty pricey and I cannot see myself spending $70+ for a piece of hardware to charge my phone when I have the plug that came with it for free.  I might consider buying a few of these if they were say, $30 each.Wireless display has been around awhile and the Android version is Mirracast, this is cool and it is an open standard so more devices than just Google TV will support it.  This will be really cool in the future but, right now it is a work in progress.DISPLAY  I am not somebody who felt that the iPhone display was the best on the market, as it clearly was not and hasn't been in some time...  With that said, this phone again took a page from Apple's book as LG went with a 300+ PPI, IPS based Display.  After using AMOLED for the past several years, I'm honestly disappointed in the Display.  Yes the display is sharp, bright, and overall very nice.  However, compared to AMOLED it has poor black levels, color saturation, and battery efficiency.  To me, this is a step back from the Galaxy Nexus and it's a shame.PERFORMANCE  This might be the only quad core S4 Krait based phone in North America (I cannot think of another at this time) and as a result, the CPUs are likely the fastest around (yes faster than the iPhone) but, the use of an Adreno 320 GPU makes it a decent performer but, not the best in terms of Graphics.  Overall, a very smooth phone that will not have any issues running the latest apps and games but, it could have been better.NETWORK PERFORMANCE  The Nexus 4 is an HSPA+42 GSM based phone and for what it is, the performance is great.  HSPA+ is good but, it is no LTE so if that matters to you, then steer clear of the Nexus...  For me, I use Net10 on the AT&T Network and I really have no issues with the speed as long as I can have unlimited Data for a low fee.  This is pretty much a wash until Carriers return unlimited data connections with LTE speeds.CAMERAS  This is a tough one, I never really think much of the Video-Conference cameras as most get the job down pretty well and the Nexus is no exception.  The actual still / video camera on the phone is another issue...  I find the camera to be among the best in modest to bright sunlight but, less than ideal in lower light.  Of course, just about everyone else has included some form of stabilization in their main cameras and this is sadly something the Nexus is lacking.  Overall, they're very good cameras.SOUND  Sound is solid and I have no complaints, I don't really see this as a strength or a weakness of this phone.BATTERY LIFE  Wow, this is certainly not the strongest point for the phone!  Out of the box, the phone might get you through 8 to 10 hours of heavy intermittent use but, it is not an all day beast by any means.  I had to turn off Google's Maps and Latitude Service as that is a huge drain, it is like running Apple's find my phone with the phone reporting in every few minutes and of course turning off the GPS is a must as well.  To me, knowing there are no battery cases, and knowing you have some pretty intensive features in the OS would make the non-removable battery a suspect decision.  This might be the biggest weakness of the phone.SOFTWARE  Android Jellybean is simply the best and most feature rich OS on the market and there's not much to add to that.  The phone came unlocked and contract free so there's no skins or malware installed on the unit.Google Hangouts is far better than FaceTime as you can have 9 people on the same video chat at once.Google Maps trumps Apple Maps by a mile.Google Chrome much more feature rich than Safari.Mobile Hot spot, being an unlocked phone makes for an unlocked Hot Spot and that is a huge benefit of this handset.CONCLUSSION  It is a nice phone but, I really hate that these companies are going so far after the iPhone features that they fail to exclude many of the weaknesses!  Samsung was pretty bad at this but, at least they left most of it in software and adjusted for the hardware.  With LG creating a phone that has a Glass front / back plate, a sealed battery, and an IPS Display just seems like they've included too many of the negatives of the iPhone and taken a the Nexus line a few steps back in some areas.Now, let me say I've only been using the phone for a few days but, this isn't my first smartphone.  Do I like the phone?  Yes, I like it a lot!  Do I love the phone? I think it is too early to say, as there certainly are features that are problematic to me.                    I ordered the unlocked Nexus 4 in order to buy in to the T-Mobile 5GB data plan ($30 w/ 100 minutes).  Previously I had an LG Optimus S for over three years...it was a decent phone that was built like a tank, but the lack on internal memory finally became just too much.The Nexus 4 is a nice looking piece of hardware and feels pretty solid in hand.  I haven't had a problem with scratching, but I installed the Skinomi TechSkin - LG Nexus 4 Screen Protector Ultra Clear Shield + Full Body Protective Skin + Lifetime Warranty on the front and back and purchased the Nexus 4 bumper from Google.  Together they make a great encasement for the phone - and the bumper actually makes it easier to hit the power/volume buttons.Performance - it is quick, snappy, and can do pretty much anything you would like in a very short period of time.  I like the integration with Google+ and GoogleNow is a pretty neat service.  The interface is smooth and simple...I love it.  The texting/swiping feature is way more accurate and intuitive than my old phone's Swype feature.Screen - The screen is nice, crisp and a really good size for viewing web pages in landscape mode.  I've found that it is almost easier to read text on the Nexus 4 than it is on my tablet or (admittedly old) 15" computer screen.  Streaming video is clear and crisp as well.  Side angle viewing is not great - at about 30 degrees you experience notable dimming of objects on screen.Call Quality is clear and vastly superior to my old Sprint phone.  I have no problems with dropped calls or distortion even though T-Mobile's coverage here is somewhat spotty.The biggest negative I can share is that I'm very disappointed with the camera.  The HDR mode is useless unless you're taking a picture of a still life scene.  When I attempted to use it in an action sequence (my son on a bounce house type thing) I got some crazy ghosting/negative space image that was totally unrecognizable as a human.  In the standard photo option I have been observing obvious graininess and pixelation even when taking photos of stationary people/objects.  The video camera is all right, but don't count on it for clear images of rapid motion (a video of my son in the same bounce house is pixellated and overall poor quality).  Hopefully this can be fixed in a future update as I do use my phone camera frequently.***UPDATE 4/3/13***Perhaps my initial criticism of the camera was a little too harsh.  I am finding that under well-lit conditions, the camera performs well in the standard mode.  I haven't attempted to use the HDR mode again given poor earlier results.  Low-light is a little dicey and is where I see the most graininess in photos.  The video mode works much better in well-lit environments as well.  It's still far from perfect (lack of stability control is probably a prime contributor), but it is good for most environments in which you'd be taking photos.************If the camera met even my minimal standards this would be a 5-star smartphone.  It's a joy to use for 95% of its functions.  If you rely on your phone to be your only camera I would buy the Nexus 4, take it for a test run and determine whether it's for you or not.  If you don't care about the camera it is a no-brainer for an Android phone.  The only other phone that came close in my opinion is the Lumia 920 - also a great phone if you prefer the Windows ecosystem.
!###$199 for the 8gb, $249 for the 16gb. Just add to cart to see the new price. Great phone, but a ripoff at these prices.                    This is my first smart phone and first android device. I'm used to apple products. I have iPods and iPads. But for $700 did not want to buy the iPhone. For half that I can get the Nexus 4, and with better specs than the iPhone 4S.Love the screen size. The speed and reliability of this phone. Never an issue making calls on T Mobile. It did freeze on me once when I ran a new app. Had to hard reset and deleted the app. To me this phone beats the iPhone. I just can't use the iPhone 5's tiny screen. Going from an ipad mini to an iPhone is too much of a down size.The battery is just about average. Heavy use will probably not last the day. Medium use barely makes the full 16 hrs. So basically is charge at night use during the day, repeat.Android OS is nice, not as polished as iOS 6. The trade off is freedom from big brother apple, but some of the apps really suck. The same apps in android just don't look as good nor perform as well as the same apps in iOS.Stock android apps also aren't as full featured as apple apps. The clock is so basic I had to get another one.  The calculator is almost useless beyond +- / *.So in summary. The phone itself is a 9. Now compared to newer ones down to an 8. But the price bumps it up to an 8.5. The most bang for the buck by a long shot. In fact there isn't any competition in this category. The biggest disappointment is the OS. Definitely a downgrade from iOS. But then I don't have to deal with iTunes, so it definitely wins there.Love this phone and so glad I bought it over iPhone and S3/S4.***** Update *****After daily use for awhile now I love this phone even more. And loving T Mobile too. Because T Mobile now is offering unlimited everything and no contracts, having a smart phone is affordable and a tech geeks dream.Briefly, since moving to T Mobile I don't have to worry about any overage charges, just the same bill month after month, no surprises.  Because I get unlimited data even on the lowest tier plan (only 500 mb of high speed data, then it is throttled down to 2g speeds), I can use the Nexus 4 without a worry.  Actually my only worry is if the battery will last the day.  I love driving around town using GPS and Pandora at the same time. I was afraid that the 2g speeds would prevent me from doing this, but it streams music and runs Navigation seamlessly. It seems to all work as if I were on 4g speeds, I cannot tell the difference in performance.This brings me to my most pleasant surprise so far. Since I need to pump Pandora through the car speakers with an audio jack and I like to use Navigation at the same time, I was startled to hear the music being muted then the Nav voice tell me where to go through the car speakers!  I had no idea that it could do this. I know pretty naive, but this is my first smart phone. Google Nav blows my Garmin away. I don't have to worry about outdated maps, slow start ups, input that takes forever and a dead battery. I hardly use the Garmin any more. Garmin had better watch out before it becomes the next Block Buster.2g speeds: although running Pandora and Nav doesn't seem to be any slower, web surfing sure is. It may take a minute to open a web page that took only 10 sec on 4g. So there definitely is a throttle, but for me I may only be throttled for the last week or so of each month.  Definitely worth the savings for a minor temporary inconvenience.The Google Nexus 4 has made my life a lot easier and T mobile has made it all happen without much more cost than what we were paying for two dumb phones.                    BLUE Pill - You stay plugged in and on your 2 year contract. You continue your life oblivious to the hidden charges and fees that your carrier is charging you just for having a phone.RED Pill - You buy the Nexus and I will show you just how far the rabbit hole goes.Last chance!! I'm only offering you "my opinion" nothing more!!!Here we go - what I like1 - Fast - Seriously this phone powers on fast goes through the menu's very quick2 - Smooth - I'm so impressed with Jelly Bean 4.2 - You must use this for yourself3 - Feel, - Great job LG this is a great device very well made4 - Affordability - 299.99 with NO CONTRACT!! The options are endless for GSM users5 - Google Drive - Don't need a memory card Besides isn't it time to stop carrying your whole music collection around with you? that's so 2007Now here are things that are causing me some stress1 - I'm using it too much!!2 - The screen is too damn clear - I did not expect to like it so much.3 - Replaced my Galaxy note - I once said that " when you go Note you don't go back" I was wrong.4 - LTE not enabled - LOL right, I can fix that.5 - NBA game-time on Jellybean 4.2.1 not working - I want to return this to Google and DEMAND my money back - Oh wait I did take the RED Pill, so it's ok.Seriously this is a great phone I really cant tell you how nice it looks and feels in your hand and MOST IMPORTANT this one just keeps moving no stuttering and freezing. I really like my phone and I'm sure you will like too.                    I have been using this phone for a few weeks, and I must say that I am quite impressed with it. It is a little bit bigger than my hand, which took some getting used to when migrating from my old phone, but I was able to adjust. The volume buttons are in a slightly different position than my old phone, so the first few times I used them I missed and ended up hitting the up volume when I was  aiming to turn it down. This is mostly due to me being used to a smaller phone, so if you are someone upgrading from a smaller phone, these are things you should be aware of.As for the phone itself, it is quite thin and has a very nice finish on the back. The size makes it feel slightly more prone to slipping from your hand, so I do suggest purchasing a case. I have not picked out one myself yet but do plan to.As for the responsiveness of the phone, the processor is very fast and the fact that you get the latest updates to Android is a major bonus. Within the first time of powering on, I had already received my first Android update that I have ever received over the air, and I have been using an Android phone for a year and a half. The fact that it doesn't come with any extra bloat from carriers is a very big bonus.Now some things I have heard mentioned that are major complaints about the phone: lack of LTE and lack of removable battery, and the lack of an SD card. The lack of LTE doesn't concern me very much, as through T-Mobile I have still been able to get 10Mbps down and 1Mbps up easily. The removable battery would be nice, but at this time it has not been too big of a concern for me. If you run the phone very hard, chances are you may drain the battery in about 5 hours, but if you simply use it for light browsing and keep it locked some, it will last you through the day. For the final concern, in order to get around storing my whole music collection on my phone, I have begun using google music. Since you get 25,000 songs for free, I was easily able to fit my whole music collection on google music. If you do this however you will want to be careful with any limits your carrier imposes on your wireless, I have already used 1.7GB of my 2GB plan halfway through the month, about 500MB of which was used on music. Now that I know I can easily "pin" and "unpin" songs while I am on wifi in google music (which downloads them to your phone for listening), I will be using that feature to save my phone bandwidth.To wrap up: Great phone overall, and if you are looking for a clean android experience with no hassles, this may very well be your phone.                    Bearing in mind the Nexus 5 (brand new with same amount of memory, better hardware, newer firmware) is available right now on the Google store for the same price (350), don't you think it's about time for a price reduction?                    This is a good phone and I don't think I can say much more than people have already said, but it has one glaring flaw that I don't hear people talk much about. If you're like me and don't like having a bumper or case on your phone, be careful where you put it! Unless your house is very level, it's likely to slide off of a lot of smooth, flat surfaces because of its glass back. It's not unusual for me to find my phone on the floor, after it slides off of whatever I put it on. Thankfully though, I have carpet :P This problem is ESPECIALLY bad with the wireless charging orb; you can find some time-lapse videos on Youtube of people's Nexus 4s sliding right off of it. So I'd recommend at the very least putting a skin on the back. I'm going to do mine, but just haven't gotten around to it yet.Also, if you're an AT&T user, you're probably going to get painfully slow speeds out of the gate, but some tweaking to the APN settings should help out a lot. Just Google 'nexus 4 apn at&t'. When I did this, I went from less than 3mbps to 10-13mbps. I'm not sure how/if this works on T-mobile.UPDATE: March 2013 - They redesigned the phone so that there's little nubs on the bottom that keep the glass back slightly elevated off surfaces. This should help with the sliding issues. If you get a used one though, then I suppose all bets are off. I also put Ghost Armor (google for more info) on the back of mine, and it has helped a great deal, esp with the wireless charger.I've also tried it with T-mobile, and it seems that the default APN settings are fine. Overall, it's faster than AT&T's HSPA, but just like any other carrier, if you don't have good coverage (which T-mobile seems to lack in a lot of places), it will make your life miserable. T-mobile has (as of this writing) a pre-paid plan where you can get 100 minutes of talk with 5gb of data for $30, which is an excellent way to try out the service.                    A few weeks ago I sold my Galaxy S III and got this phone instead, and I'm so glad I did. The pure Android experience is amazingly swift (other smartphones' overlays and bloatware apparently make their phones slower). I now go between applications like is nothing: no hiccups when scrolling, no freezing for a few seconds; nothing of that sort. Actually, the Nexus just recently updated to Jellybean 4.3, which brought several 'under the hood' enhancements.The weakest points of this phone are (for me): the lack of 'official' LTE, the lack of MicroSD slot (no expandable memory), and the camera, which is OK, but not great. However, these are small shortcomings when compared to what I do get from the phone.I keep hearing Nexus 5 is 'coming out soon', but I could not wait (plus, it would take some few months after its release before I could get it where I live).Overall, I'm very, very happy with this phone. After experiencing pure Android, I don't think I'm ever going back to a brand phone.Get this phone if you are looking for:Really fast and smooth performance.Pure and latest Android.Direct support from Google.Low price.Great screen.Don't get this phone if what matters to you most is:LTE capability.Expandable internal memory.Amazing camera.Hope this mini review is useful for you.                    My family and I have been iPhone users since 2007.  All 5 of us just recently switched to a Nexus.  They are excellent and none of us can believe that we stayed with Apple for so long.  When I hold an iPhone now it seems like a silly toy.Advantages - Fast, intuitive, easy to use, customization ease, no more dreaded iTunes, beautiful screen, Google's synchronization, I could write for an hour.  Perfect.  One more thing - the size.  The size is just right.  It is larger than the iPhone, but smaller than the massive silly looking Galaxy.  The movies, surfing, app use, and a navigation are all MUCH better than iPhone.  The larger Samsung Galaxy just looks and feels too big and silly in one's hand.  It looks like a brick or a tablet.  Nexus is the perfect phone size.  They got it right.Disadvantages - few.  You will need a case right away because it does have a glass back.  The speakers are not great (but they get the job done) and most people use headphones.  Nothing else for us.Buy and show your fiends and family.  You will do them a favor.                    Anterior a este telefono tenia un samsung galaxy ace plus, era muy bueno, pero cuando lo cambie por el Nexus 4 la diferencia es total, es decir creo que solo el Samsung  S4 lo supera.Hablando propiamente del telefono, la camara es muy buena, graba videos de muy buena calidad y tiene unas funciones para editar fotos y poder hacer algunos cambios que no habia visto en otros telefono, el procesador del telefono es realamente eficiente.No se que m&aacute;s decirle, pero si se los recomiendo a cualquier persona es un excelente producto, lo unico negativo es que solo tiene 16 gb de memoria interna me parece que podr&iacute;a tenee m&aacute;s.Previous to this phone had a samsung galaxy ace plus, was very good, but when I changed to the Nexus 4, the difference is total, ie believe that only Samsung surpasses S4.Properly speaking the phone, the camera is very good, records videos of very good quality and has a photo editing functions and to make some changes that I had not seen in other phone, the phone is realamente processor is most telling eficiente.No but if you recommend it to anyone is an excellent product, the only negative is that it only has 16 gb internal memory I think it might Tenee more.                    Is it the best phone in the market right now? No but for the price of $300-$350 plus tax from Google for a unlocked phone with specs and performance that the Nexus 4 has you won't find a better phone then this. If I bought this phone for $500 and up price range i would be much harsher about the lack a SD card slot, no removable battery, only a 8 and 16 GB models, lack of LTE. However i got it from the play store for $350 plus tax for a great unlock phone so i can overlook the missing features and find ways to compensate.Many people and reviewers have already highlighted the pros and cons of the Google Nexus 4 so i will skip that part. I just have to say it that it is the people who buy them in bulk from Google just make a profit is the reason why people who actually plan on using it from getting it. Glad they now limit it to 2 per buyer hopefully this way more people can get their hands this phone.
!###First good things - Google android OS is incomparable, works perfects on this device.Bad - LG hardware is very bad, built quality is cheap, looks like designed to self destruct within year. Picture quality is bad, phone is flimsy...I had sent it to repair under warrenty, I got very generic reply water damage, my phone is water damage so everything else works but on/off switch, seems water only affected the switch not other parts. Of course I don't have time and money to fight with LG but one thing for sure, I will never purchase any LG products anymore.I recommend every one not to use LG products.                    Though this product is sold with international warranty, no one in my country respect it. I bought it in amazon because it says it comes with it, and i am totally disappointed that i won't have what to do in case something goes wrong.                    After owning this phone for 4 months I am confident in recommending it to anyone in the market for a smartphone. No other phone comes close to the Nexus 4 in performance and value.Benefits of the 4.7 inch screen:1. Easy to type on without being unwieldy.2. Less squinting and zooming on Webpages3. Readable GPS Maps when you mount it in your car4. Makes your friend's iPhone look like a child's toyBenefits of being a stock Google phone:1. Faster performance due to lack of 3rd party bloatware (besides the apps you install yourself)2. Always be the first to get the latest Android updates, enhancing the life of the phoneOther Positive Attributes:1. Owner does not experience "lag" due to fast 4-core processor and capable gpu2. Owner can ditch a point-and-shoot on account of Nexus 4 camera quality3. Owner gains membership to an elite group of Nexus 4 owners4. Owner is more wealthy as he/she did not overpay for a smartphoneNegatives:1. Recent Android 4.3 update breaks 5Ghz WiFi connectivity, Google has not resolved the issue. (most people will have 2.4Ghz to fall back on)Other Considerations:1. Glass back is unique and stylish but also prone to breaking. I recommend a case or a clear plastic protector.2. Owner accepts responsibility to defend against trolls who think lack of 4G LTE connectivity is a negative. It is not. HPSA+ is faster than most residential internet connections in the US (emphasis on IN THE US). If you experience slow speeds on HPSA+, switch providers. Your current provider is not properly maintaining network infrastructure.3. Owner is encouraged to shop for a prepaid plan instead of a contract plan. A certain provider in the US offers 5GB high speed data prepaid for $30 a month.                    This is the very first phone I've ever buy outside. I must say it is a nice phone, if you're looking for a fast, considerably cheap phone with android, look no further. The phone is a really nice piece of technologic, sure one or two improvements can be made, but is very good in general. I'm very happy with it.A considerable aspect, it is the notification's volume, it's NOT so loud, anyway I'm always with my hands on the phone, it does not affect me that much.IMPORTANT: I did not know this phone does not come with earphones. So you should consider buy a pair.ALSO IMPORTANT:I'm from venezuela, used &#34;liberty express&#34; for the shipment, it was fast and everything was in their place. My celphone carrier is movistar, you have to cut the chip, so it fits in your new phone.                    Excellent! No doubt, for that want feel really Android-Google experience, nice design, nice price, nice OS, i'm in Venezuela and here is really functional for my job and my works how graphic design. Buy now.                    I am using the Nexus 4 for less than 1 month. and i already have problems.I cannot hear anythin unless i use headphones or speaker.when i looked for a solution i discovered a lot of pepole have the same  problem and google has no solution.                    Since I bought a google nexus tablet early this year, I thought that my next smartphone would be a google nexus phone so I bought it last july. Am I happy? This is the smartest move I've ever made. I just had to type my google username and the phone did everything for me. It downloaded and installed and updated ALL the apps that I had in my tablet. All I had to do was to organize the widgets the way I like them.As with the tablet, the speaker does a lousy job when playing music (with earphones the sound is great though).I tried to buy this directly from google play but I couldn't since I am from Venezuela (but that's another story) so I ended up buying it a little more expensive from amazon. No regrets though. Great service and still ended up saving some money because I had to pay no S&H.                    It's flawless, pure android, speed daemon. I Am very happy with this phone. It's all good. i take a picture, share it then i switch where i left in one of my games in a matter of a seconds.                    The unit I received was bad (electronics or antenna); just sitting on the table in the kitchen the phone would switch from three bars to zero to two to one back up to three... then if you tried to use it, &#34;No Service&#34;.  Another Android phone (same SIM card, so it wasn't T-Mobile's fault) worked solidly.Same situation going downstairs or to the bedroom - wildly varying service bars, and failure when you actually tried to use it.Same situation in a hotel.  Four bars if you stood in the window (and you could SEE THE TOWER across the street in the parking lot of a mall)... but step back two steps and no service.  Same thing driving - Same thing walking around Boston.I am returning the phone.                    Awesome phone, unbeatable price-quality relation. This store has the phone a bit overpriced (though it allows for getting the phone faster).
!###i had been pick up my package it is very good. I very like it thanks you very much thankss                    I'd like so much of htis product.It's a great product.Its met my expectations!I love it so much!                    Nexus 4 is a nice, elegant and powerful device. I keep it now for more than two weeks and enjoy it very much. The screen is big and sharp enough to provide great tablet PC services. A lot of applications in App Store make the usage of Nexus 4 really very enjoyable.I want to add that the supplier really did his best to deliver the good just in time.                    If you are in doubt, buy it!! It's wonderfull. Very beautiful and great performance, no complains. I was a little worried but now I'm happy to have choosed this one.                    This is my third high end android device and my second Nexus.Coming from a Galaxy Nexus, the screen is awesome. It feels better built, high quality materials.Snah-ppy. Very, very responsive.                    The bad:Both sides made from glass and thus slippy. My phone already falled twice.The good:Its not broken after falling from ~3 feets. )The pure android is usable without any additional software.The google phone has long life cycle and will receive updates (other vendors do not push updates to phone after ~half a year).                    Its a great phone, but I dont recommend to someone that already have a galaxy s3 or some 2012 high-end phone. I purchased just because I'm a big fan of Android OS, I want to have google's android updates faster than those by sammy, motorola, specially here in my country, where those updates are not that often.                    Definitely worth it. Would recomend to anyone who is looking for a new smartphone. It is fast, responsive, and good looking.                    I've waiting too long for this phone but Google is always without stock. I paid few extra buck but i finally have my nexus. Happy!The phone is great no problem so far!                    I've owned 5 different Android phones over the past 6 years and this is BY FAR the best.  The phone feels superb, is lightning fast and does everything better than any other smartphone I've owned or used.  Jelly Bean is fantastic and I honestly have no complaints.  You will not be sorry purchasing one of these if you can patiently wait for the Google store to start stocking them again.
!###I loved the phone and wanted to keep ot. However i could not have it activated with my verizon account because i didn't know about the 2 diffrerent systems..I recieved the phone quick and in perfect condition. What a shame....Thank YouJim                    I have owned this device since the beginning of 2013, and will write a review based on how it is now. First off, the  Nexus 4 is excellent value (Google play!) and great for prepaid plans (I don't text that much). I just got the 4.3 Android update and it is running as smooth as when I bought it. The only noticeable delay is when it is starting up, but that is normal with most electronics. I have noticed people complaining about battery issues - as far as I'm concerned it is fine and we will see what will happen when the phone comes of age. I do not turn wi-fi on unless I am using it or at home/near a battery source. I use this phone mainly to chat with friends and browse the web. I do play some games occasionally, but I have a computer and console for that! I do understand that watching videos is battery-drainer on this device, but I mainly watch movies on my phone at home so that is not an issue. The appearance of the phone is very nice. In fact, it is so nice I still cannot find the off-screen buttons. The screen is similar to most smartphones and will need care. You wouldn't drop a few hundred dollars, try to not drop a few hundred dollars device! I have a cover and a screen protector and I do not even notice the screen protector. The screen is noticeably big for my small hands but I have come to love the screen and now I can't go any smaller! For people wondering about the sound, the speakers are pretty average and they are hard to hear when the phone is put down screen up. But yes, it can be a bulky mp3 player. What's almost unique to this phone is the onscreen navigation buttons, which promise more screen real estate. I have figured that you cannot get rid of them without rooting for the most part, but most of the time it is not an interference.Overall, if you are looking for a smartphone and can't afford those 600 dollar plus smartphones, the Nexus 4 might be the perfect choice for you. It can achieve many of the features high end smartphones can at an ideal price. I didn't regret it!                    This phone is by far the best. I'll explain why. My brother bought the S4, and I have to say, although colors are richer, I don't notice the huge pixel density difference, at all. This is something I always complained about. The human eye can difference up to 300 ppi at a decent distance, then why do they put 450ppi screens if you can't enjoy it. It's fast, with Android 4.3 update works really fluid, and you won't notice any kind of lag whatsoever. I reccommend both this phone and this seller.                    I wanted to buy a new phone after my Blackberry started to die and kept contemplating between an iPhone and S4 until my son recommended me Nexus 4. I was skeptical but post a lot of research decided to pick it. It was difficult to buy this as I am from India and was visiting US for a short time and the phone was not available in any store except @ Google Play or Amazon. Finally bought 16 Gb model from Amazon.The phone is just great and I have had this for 2 months or so. It has already got updated to 4.3. The phone performs very well with no lag. The touch is perhaps the best I have experienced. The network / WiFI speed is good and no jitter while watching video. It does get warm during use.  The price / performance is perhaps best build quality is luxurious with all glass. But this is also a problem as the glass is very slippery. I recently placed the phone on some clothes and the vibration from an incoming call caused the phone to fall 2 feet and the front glass shattered and the touch became unresponsive. Fortunately this phone has been released in India and I got my screen replaced ( took the LG technician 20 mins to do so ). Damage INR 4726 :( - I am now investing in a bumper case. Many users have complained about the fragile nature of the phone. The phone battery is in built and costs INR 900 odd here.The battery lasts a day and but has a sharp drop from 100% to 90% and then discharges at an acceptable rate. This phone requires a heavy charger and a typical 700 mA charger will take a long time to charge esp. beyond 80%. Use the OEM charger. I additionally bought a spare 2.1 Amp non-OEM charger which is what I usually use.Other than this ( therefore 4 stars and not 5 ),  I am delighted to have this phone.                    This is an amazing cell phone with an excellent price. No complains about it. Jusst an advice: In google play store have a better price but if you can't buy in play store amazon is good                    Really cool device with great design and performance. I like it. 4.3 came a few days ago with some really useful features. I really like this phone because all new updates are coming really quickly.                    This phone is perfect and i got it for  a wonderful price. It has big screen, excellent camera, and the android system is up to date. It competes with all the other phones if not surpassing them but is affordable. The back of the phone looks pretty cool but the only problem is that it is also glass so you have to be even more careful and should buy a case for it so you cant show off the back of the phone. I think anyone looking for an unlocked phone should buy this one and it ships fast! My rating of the Nexus 4 is actually 10 stars lol but it wont go that high.                    First lets talk about the price, I have seen many reviews focusing on the fact that this phone is more expensive here than at the google store. Yes, its more expensive, but not that much, consider the that this phone has free shipping ( when I got had it ) and you don't pay taxes wich can set you back at least 50 dollars. So at the end its not a big difference and here the shipping was fast and was able to use some gift cards already had.Now about the phone. Because of its 2GB of RAM, you can throw any memory hog app and it will take it with class, not even a blink. I got this phone for my wife after I put the last one in the laundry by accident ( or maybe she put it there intentionally to get a new one ) She installs a lot of apps and keep them running at all times, this will would get her 512mb RAM old phone to a crawl. You won't need to change this phone for at least 2-3 years unless you have the need to have the latest toy.It has all the latest technology: NFC, rear and front camera, compass and the gps and no crap software forced on you by the carrier. To be safe at least get the bumper to protect it.With what we are saving by switching to NET10, This and another phone for me will get themselves paid in  about 10 months.                    I'll keep my review brief.I actually liked this phone quite a bit.  I like the OS, the store, the ease of loading and using the apps from the store.  The screen seems big, and looks great.Here's the cons I've discovered w\ mine :*Fragile  The phone simply breaks very easily.  I had an iphone 4 for over 2 years without a crack... worked great.  This thing can't withstand the smallest of falls.*Battery life  The battery life is horrible.  I find the phone constantly needing to be charged.  Some things like the flashlight even seem to run the battery out despite having been closed.                    this smartphone is very nice, but some with some days of test unexpected bugs on whatsapp and playstore appeared.. as it was claimed to be a "clean android"i did not expected any issues... but it worth the money and i really enjoyed that.
!###I bought mine on Google Play, but wanted to write a review since there were many things I wish reviewers has mentioned:1.) The Android Experience is amazing. Just with the Stock Rom it is excellent.2.) The camera is crappy. Try taking it to a concert and if you are not in the first row you will take crappy pictures while your friends with Samsung and Apple phones are taking amazing pictures.3.) The speaker phone and volume is pretty bad. If you are in a car it is hard to hear using the normal phone option so I always put it on speaker phone.4.) Battery life is good, but not great. Expect to charge it all the time.5.) Sometimes it will not charge with car chargers. Since there is no Google Nexus charger, invest in a high power USB car charger and use your LG (manufacturer of the Nexus 4) cable to charge it (especially if you have a US warranty).Overall a good phone, but Google did not put enough thought into product. If they had they would have had beta testers take this to concerts to take pictures, thought about providing a branded car charger, and considered how the speaker works in practice. More testing was needed. But, still an amazing phone, and for an unlocked phone it is a lot cheaper than the Apple.                    My Samsung S3 was stolen. I bought this Nexus 4 phone as a replacement until the Samsung S4 is publicly released.I'm impressed the the call quality and speed of this phone but that's it.The Nexus 4 is missing some important features.#1: Battery can not be replaced.#2: No microSD card for backups or media.#3: No 32 and 64 GB internal storage.#4: No native wireless charging.#5: No LTE.#6: No FM radio.The one thing all cell phones are missing.. built in emergency weather alert channels if the power and cell towers go out.                    I've had the galaxy nexus for over a year, it did get a few knocks and dents but never a deep scratch on the touchscreen. this one got it after two weeks. so much for gorilla glass.apart from that it is exactly what I expected.                    Had the Samsung Epic 4g, so comming from an older phone to this phone was like switching from a Ford Pinto to a Ford Mustang. This phone is great and has so many new features that I have not even fully had a chance to explore. I can't wait to fully explore and test out every feature of this phone. The screen is crystal clear and bright and set up was quick and easy. I would recommend this phone to anyone. its awesome.                    This is my first Nexus device and I have been enjoying everyday that I have been using this phone.Well worth the money and pretty future-proof.                    I'm glad I picked this phone over the unlocked iPhone 5. I got my Nexus 4 from the Google play store. I using the Nexus 4 with T-Mobile prepaid. I mostly go on YouTube via WiFi and watch HD movies on it. I wrote this review on the Nexus 4.                    I have been using Nexus devices ever since the HTC Nexus One, and I have to say that the Nexus 4 is the best Nexus I've used. It's speed, and fluid and the touch screen responds really well.While I have an issue with the fact that I can't replace the battery like on previous Nexus devices, I am really impressed with the battery performance, where with the Galaxy Nexus I would only last half a day before I had to either charge or switch batteries, the Nexus 4 goes nearly a full day.I honestly love using the phone                    I purchased two of these phones to replace old iPhones for my wife an I.  The Android OS 4.2 is amazing and so much more powerful than iOS.  We love the OS, however the Nexus 4, not so much.Our goal was to completely do away with our dependency on Apple and iOS.  Looking back, I wish we would have picked the older Galaxy Nexus or some other, less fragile, Android phone as this LG version of the Nexus is a very poor quality product.  Within a couple months of extremely careful care, the back glass already has a HAIRLINE CRACK going from one side to the other.  A few weeks later a CRACK showed up on my wife's phone going from top to bottom.Having owned an iPhone 3 and 4 for years and having dropped both of them many times and never experiencing a crack, I was shocked at how both our Nexus 4 phones got CRACKS in the back glass within two months.  Called Google Play and they say their warranty is only for 15 days and to talk to LG.  LG said I could send in the phone for an evaluation and if they felt it was just a "cosmetic" problem they would bill me for repairs as anything cosmetic is not covered.Still want this phone? Just Google for Nexus 4 crack and see how many people are experiencing cracking...                    I never managed to have a call that would last longer than 30 minutes. It always drops the call. It can drop within a few minutes, or 15, but it will drop. I tried everything I could imagine, from not moving the phone, to not moving at all, different locations, software updates, tricks suggested in blogs, etc, nothing solved the issue.I have had T-Mobile for years, and many other phones, and still have other phones using that carrier. Only the Nexus 4 bought directly from Google Play has done that. I complained but got nowhere. I can't wait for it to break so I can get rid of it.I will never buy anything from Google, other than apps written by other people, because their after sales service is non-existant, especially once the 14 days return policy has expired.So, go ahead, get one anyway. Maybe you'll be lucky. :-)))                    I only bought Nexus 4 a couple of weeks and already the glass is broken (quoted $160 to replace). Judging by other reviews online this is not an unusual occurrence. It's got the slipperiest surface imaginable. It slides off everything. Unfortunately, I set it down and it slid away falling flat on its front. The glass smashed rendering the touch screen inoperable. I wasn't using a cover or bumper - I don't like the idea of buying a super slim phone just to clad it in extra plastic.About the phone - fantastic. It's fast and the antenna are excellent. Compared to my work phone - Droid Razr M - the Nexus has full bars in my apartment when the Razr has one. Other than the fact that the thing takes off on its own it's a great phone.
!###I can't say that I've owned a lot of cell phones, but everything is just so smooth on this phone.                    I love this phone and I enjoy so much the pure Android experience. I liked the service, fast shipping and very secure. This cellphone worth all the money I paid for. Thanks!!!                    This is the second nexus I buy to this store and it did not disappoint me at all. Thanks for doing online shopping a good experience.                    This is my first review of the device, let me tell you this phone is really fast, the android experience is really awesome.The only downside is the battery, I wish it would last longer, but with the 3G network and use I do of the device it last from 7am to 4pm at least. I listen music and use the web a lot and chat services (whatsapp, Facebook, hangouts).I also bought an Anker external battery which was the best combo ever. It give extra juice to the device is case of a trip. Actually I only charge it on the nights if you charge it a little in the afternoon it would last for the rest of the day.The screen is beautiful and so does the finish, but I bought a case too because the gorilla glass back doesn't give me confidence.Beautiful and fast device. If you love Google products and want a new phone this is the one.Oh! The camera is not the best one in the market, quite decent but the S3 one is way better, but that's not an awful thing, pics looks good and using the HDR options give them a more stylish look.Recommended!                    The nexus 4 is a great phone with great features. The galaxy S4 is the first phone with really comparable specs.The list price on Amazon is a total bogey though. From the manufacturer the phone is 299.99 for the 8gb and 349.99 for the 16gb. Add shipping and you pay about $384 for the 16 gb model. I don't know where "list prices" come from, but it is not necessarily the manufacturer according to this product.                    I purchased my Google Nexus 4 16GB - Unlocked from T-Mobile for a considerable savings. They have excellent and affordable monthly plans for talk, text, data and wi-fi. This phone is very easy to use, lightweight and has a long battery life even when using it as a wi-fi hotspot. I am still discovering all of its features like bluetooth, ethernet tethering and usb tethering. Google chrome to mobile and Google voice work very well together. I am very happy with my purchase.Google Nexus 4 Phone 16GB - Unlocked                    one of the best phones! The time of delivery and the product was perfect. I recomend the seller and this phone. Is very fast and works with all the aplications I have downloaded.                    This is an incredible phone with a few drawbacks depending on your preference. The first thing you will notice if you come from other Android phone is the smoothness and speed. You touch the screen and it responds. You swipe down and follows. It doesnt think a second or two to know what you are up to. This may be partly due to its latest Jelly bean 4.2 software. All the Android phones I have used so far have rooms for improvements when it comes to performance. The lag is sometimes unbearable.The design is great eventhough the glass back looks delicate and so it is better to have a nice case to protect it.  It looks simple on a table but feels solid and expensive in your hands. The weight is just right in my opiniom. Things like the voulme and power button are rightly placed. I really enjoy holding this phone just the way it is but unfortunately I will have to get a case for it.THINGS I DONT LIKE ABOUT THE PHONE:NO SD CARD is an issue for me some what. I am not a heavy user of music files but I feel like I might need more storage in the long run. But now I just have to go easy on downloads.CALL QUALITY definitely needs some improvements. I feel like the volume is a bit low and so it is sometimes hard to hear the other person if you are in a noisy area. The outside speaker is tiny and poorly placed in my opinion. Its easy to cover it if you lay it on a table. This is where the HTC One clearly outperforms the compitition.BATTERY LIFE is about average depending on how you set things like screen brightness and auto syncing. I wont say that it is horrible but not great either.NO LTE can be an isue for some people but not for me. I hardly use mobile data. Most of my internet browsing and downloads are on Wifi.OVERALL this is a great phone in my opinion and I honestly will find it very difficult to use any other Android phone right now. The price is right and the fact that it is unclocked is an added value. Also since this phone is by Google it will always get the latest Android updates. Other Android phones are notoriously slow to catch up.I WILL RECOMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE.UPDATE 9-13-2013:  The biggest issue with this phone remains the volume. I listen to music a lot while driving and when connected to my car the sound is just too low no matter what I do. Now I am not sure whether this partains to my phone alone but I have no reason to believe that all other Nexus 4s does not suffer the same low volume issue. At one time I even planned to cancel my Google music subscription because I just wasn't enjoying it the way I would like to but I later changed my mind. The call quality is not as bad as I thought so no more complaints as I had when I first started using it.                    Experience the best of google.Pros:Look and FeelDecent sizeSpeedCons:Glass (Get a case)Battery Life (Get CM10, Paranoid Android + Custom Kernel)                    Beautiful, shiny, fast with a large and high resolution screen. And better, pure Android right from Google. Just one thing, got to take care with the glass back panel, isn't drop-safe!
!###Nothing to say but praise with this gem. I love everything about it, it's snappy, it runs everything I throw at it without so much as a hiccup, it has Android 4.2, IT IS AWESOME!!                    Good shop. Quickly deliver the goods and the goods are of good quality. I liked everything. Had the lowest price. I will recommend to all.                    The best smartphone in the market now, is amazing and fast, and the support of google is a big warranty.........                    i bought this phone here and it was defenitely worth. the price tag of course is higher than that of google but business will  be business and someones going to get profit anyways.BUT, the PRICE and the VALUE of an object are two different things. the price i paid here on amazon i consider is WORTH the cellphone. in other words if i was asked what i CONSIDER to be the price of my cellphone i would say: 600 dollares. that said i paid less than 550 for what i consider even more expensive. SO i am happy with the purchase.Second, amazon is perhaps the only true way to buy this out of US, precisely Central America. Local LG store claims they will bring it here with a pricetag of 650-700 and untill the end of Feb. So no thanks.Third, at 350 i would of course be extremely happy of the price but as i said before i am happy with what i received for what i paid.And last, the phone is a beast. Super smooth, gaming is great, everything fast. Definitely the best phone for Q1 2013.                    I used the phone for 12 days. On day 12 I was holding the phone in my hand while laying on the beach in florida. Suddenly, I heard a clicking sound and when I turned the phone back, I saw the back glass cracked. The slight temperature increase on the sun has caused surface tension and the thin glass on the back cracked. The phone still works, but it does not look nice now. Will have to return it to Google. The phone was excellent othetwise , except 2 other issues: the screen is extremely power hungry compared to other phones. Even with moderate use the screen consumes nearly all of the battery life. This is probably why the phone is offered at such a low price of 300-350 USD at the Google store. Another flaw is that it does not have the SD card slot, limiting all of the media data transfers to slow speed over the USB 2.0 or the wifi. I think that LG is well aware of these issues and this is the primary reason of low stock - they don't want to be in a position having to warranty service all of their phones with cracked glass in the summer or in the cold winter. A lot of folks on the internet report the same glass cracking issues with it.                    Bought this from the google play store. A great price for an unlocked phone with the latest OS updates. Phone is fast, screen is great and all day battery life with plenty left over (posted screen shots). I have had no battery issues although i have location services turned off just like my iphone.I also put a carbon fiber skin on the phone and don't use a case and have no issues with worrying about the phone being slippery or scratching the back glass. (See photos)                    After owning the phone for less than 2 weeks the back of the phone cracked.  It was not dropped or handled roughly.Google even within 15 days will not return the phone due to "physical damage."  They said call LG.  LG said they do not provide a warranty for a phone purchased through Google, but if I send the phone in they could charge me for fixing the phone.  When I asked about daily handling of a Nexus, LG recommended not even putting the phone in a purse without a case,stating that the front and back are glass. That is not what I would expect from a product called Gorilla Glass.The customer service was awful with both companies pointing the finger at each other or back at me.I have owned an iphone 4, and iphone 4s that have lasted years with no issue.If you can keep the phone in one piece it is a great phone.                    After two years of owning this phone, I have a pretty thorough understanding of the pros and cons of this phone.  This is my first smart phone, my previous one was a Nokia dumb phone.  Maybe I expect too much or otherwise lack of comparison to, say, iPhone, it has been a disappointment so far.PROS:1. The screen is big.2. Processor speed is good.3. Google navigation is cool, but a battery drainer.CONS:1. Cannot hang up during the phone call.  The screen is black during the phone call, and it's virtually impossible to get it back.  After googling, it's a widely complained problem, related with the problem of sensor.  The suggested solution is to use power button to force hang up, which is annoying because I lost keypad access during the call.  I also tried without covers, played with power saving options, no good. It's a problem with the phone. I hope they fixed it for the new phones.2. Battery life is very short.  For web browsing, twittering, and stuff like that, less than half day you see red line on the battery. Charging is slow too.3. Glass on screen is fragile and repair is expensive. The phone fell to the ground from 3-foot-high table top, screen was in pieces.  Try repairing it and you will feel the pain.4. Gmail always complains "no connection" over 3G wireless, even though all my other Apps, including yahoo mail, work perfectly.  Again googling reveals that this is a widely complained problem.  Playing with the options doesn't help much.  Now I don't have Gmail access on my Nexus4 over 3G.  Why can't google make such a simple App work on their native platform?In short, it's a nice phone on the first sight, but after using it for a while, you found lots of problems.  While this sounds familiar, I still feel regret as most of these problems are easily fixable. It could be better, it could be great, but it might just be that my expectation is too high for this $300 phone.                    The touchscreen's not responding half of the time. Also, it randomly presses down different points of the screen so, for example, the back or the home button are pressed at high speed, for which it's impossible to use any function of the cellphone.It all started happening after the gadget itself updated to the current Android version, and putting it back to its factory settings didn't work. I haven't dropped or hit my Nexus, and I'd also been using it mostly at home, so I'm sure the hardware's fine. I've read that some other Nexus 4 users have been having the same problem, also after they updated the OS.                    Just got a Nexus 4 a few days ago. I've been using a Samsung Focus i917 Windows Phone for the last few years.I *REALLY* miss Microsoft's Zune software. This is used for syncing music, photos, and video between the phone and a PC. I like it a lot more than Google Music. With Google Music, you have to upload your collection to their servers, and then download the items back to your phone. Zune can perform the sync between the PC and phone over the local wifi network.I also miss the Focus AMOLED screen when viewing the screen out in the sunlight.The Focus has the USB and audio ports at the top edge of the phone. The N4 has the audio on top and the USB on the bottom; this is awkward when I've got both connected.I miss the Windows Phone metro style interface; the there seems to be more consistent UI conventions across metro apps.Besides these issues, the phone is pretty awesome.
!###Excellent phone, the Best Android phone you can buy. Very good performance overall.  I also have the S4 but I like the way that N4 feel in your hands.                    Forget the iPhone's dated OS and small screen. Forget Galaxy's bloatware and clunky design. The Nexus is the best combination of design and power and let's not forget the price.                    Comparing to my old Nexus (Samsung Galaxy Nexus i9250):LG Nexus 4 - Pros:-Screen, processor and battery are awesome!Cons:-Camera and vibration are horrible! The camera has problem when using flash! You have to take like 3 or more pics to get one! The vibration is more noisy than real vibration!                    Great specs, especially for the price. I'd recommend ordering it directly from Google because it's $100 cheaper through them. Everything I do on this phone runs at an amazing speed, even downloading through wifi. I ran a speed test on this phone and my laptop and the Nexus 4 is faster! The quad core and 2 GB of RAM make this phone great for multitasking and running any android game on the market. The last phone I had was the original Droid Incredible, which was over 2 years old, so this phone was a huge upgrade. The OS is very intuitive, easy to use and comes with a lot of added features. This phone is also very efficient. I've noticed that it has a much better battery life than my old phone, even with the much more powerful processor.                    Purchased from Google, this phone is remarkable for its form, function, and price. Liked it so much, bought one for my wife and two of my three daughters (13 and 14 years of age; the six-year old got a rugged Samsung Rugby). The display is sharp and bright, the CPU is fast, and the battery life is excellent. My wife struggled mightily before giving up her iPhone 4S, but after using the Nexus 4 for several weeks and finding everything she'd grown accustomed to on the iPhone, and then some, she made the switch. She does say that indoor pictures are a bit grainier than her iPhone, but outdoor pictures are amazing. Thin and sleek, it feels good to hold, even with a case (my wife and girls use cheap two-piece snap-on cases from eBay; I'm using a black Diztronic, also from eBay, which I like a lot). We're using no-contract, unlimited service from T-Mobile; their HSPA+ service is blazingly fast. We're also able to use the phones as Mobile Access Points, should we need a Wi-Fi alternative (travel, power outage, etc.). Can't miss with these phones. Highly recommended!!                    ...but there are only 5. I'm only buying Nexus products from now on.  I know Google has to run it's contracts through all of the partners with the Open Handset Alliance, but when they do build a pure Google phone, get a Nexus.  I had the G1 and the Nexus One.  Didn't get the middle 2 (not a Samsung fan), but this phone does everything right. Get it unlocked and you're good.                    Amazingly fast, 2gb of ram makes a huge difference. Also I love the pure android experience. Just a tip, the camera performance isn't good on low light conditions but for me is not a big deal.                    This is probably one of the best phones currently in the market and the price is just unbelivable. Honestly, this is a must have for any person looking for an Android phone.                    I thought I would never leave BlackBerry OS for Android, but I was wrong! Fantastic build quality, the latest version of Android for years to come, fast as a speeding bullet, you can't beat it! Especially not at that price!                    It is good phone. It is slim and wonderful experience.I hope all of you can try this one. just try it.
!###Somehow a non fully mature phone but definately worth the money. It is my first Android machine and it runs fast. This cell phone has a very low quality camera in comparison with similar devices.                    I chose this over the iphone 5, and yes i was right, it is exceptional! i hear people saying the camera isnt as good or the display. Ive used mine and im telling you now, my camera is the best ive used on a phone, i cant even tell the difference with my S3's, the display is mysteriously nice, its just natural, ive never seen a display like this. on my S3 i was irritated by unrealistic reproduction of colours. i would transfer photos from my computer onto my S3 only to find them appearing like cartoony effects had been added on my S3, it irritated me soo much that i will never use a Super Amoled screen again. With this though, the images look exactly orclose to what they appear like on my computer screen, TV, and the camera screen itself, it is just....REAL colours, its brilliant.                    As per your orders, I have successfully found a product that would give the most in terms of quality, performance, and cost efficiency. During my research on the best product out in the market, I have come upon a lot of options to choose from. While most of them were great, I have found the perfect product for my needs .                    this its the best phone never maked. its over the others. I recommend it with eyes closed. is excellent and economic                    The best android experiment. Without any custom ROM. The hardware and the stock software gave me all I need in a smartphone. Social, gaming graphics and more.                    I have used the Samsung siii and iphone. This phone is smooth and clean. It's wicked fast and has no obvious weaknesses. Most importantly, it can be used in any country.                    Not the price of Google store but in hands. Working fine. Peolpe love to see it as a new phone.                    Very beautiful, a device with great build quality, great screen resolution and good camera.Fits well in the hand and is very light.                    Should you buy a Nexus 4, assuming you actually can? Today, little else comes close to the Nexus 4&#8217;s quality                    This wonderful product is available from Google for $ 349, after a long wait.  All those sellers offering this at astronomical price better cut it down fast.
!###This is the best phone in the market. Newer android phones like HTC One and Samsung Galaxy S IV have been announced but I don't like feel like I am loosing anything. Besides that, you cannot beat direct update from Google. It takes Samsung and HTC atleast a year to send updates.                    cool product, nice and fast :) low cost phone with high functions! i will buy again,  now samsung s4 ready                    Good phone for a nice price. Absolutely worth buying, good battery life, no lags, excellent screen and lots of power.                    Works perfect! This product is exactly up to expectations. Very nice and absolutely reliable. No problem using and it is useful.                    A very sleek looking phone that's fast and have a better battery experience than I'm use to with other smartphones. And no crappy apps and broken UI from OEMs.                    Got it as a gift and it was perfect! It was easy to load as well because after logging in with my gmail account, all my info automatically transferred from my old phone!                    hi i am interested in this phone but I know what band works because im from ecuador and i need to know                    This phone has specs that make it worth $700+. It's a bargain.Excellent screen, processor, RAM (2 GB, wow) and design. The NFC function is awesome, makes it so much practical to share content with another NFC enabled device. The only down side is the scarce storage (16GB) without an expansion sd card slot available, but that's hardly a problem if you consider how much it costs.                    I've owned twenty android devices in three years. Every nexus device so far except the 10. Take it from a pro, this is the phone you want.                    The LG Nexus 4 is an excelent  phone. I recommend highly this cell phone. Works perfect with 3G network with Movilnet (Venezuela). Very fast and I love the multi apps  open un the same time
!###It took a rather long time to ship but, independent of the dealer, the phone is an excellent device. I still recommend purchasing it from the Google store for anyone who has the possibility.                    battery life is great. if I get stuck in the neck of the woods I don't have to worry about finding an outlet like I did with my old phone. it's fast and has all sorts of nifty features i'm still finding out about.I love that it has no contract. those dang telephone companies are always looking for more ways to take my money!                    This phone is fast, looks brilliant and build quality is very good and it has latest google operating system. You need to use a good cover though because it is very slippery.                    Want it for a gift, it reached fast and safe as i wished. handeling was very good too. thanks for that                    Best phone in the market for the price.fast processor, wide screen ,latest version of Android.made of gorilla glass front and back....                    So far one of the best phones from Google / LG, beautiful, strong, fast and stable!, The OS has an excellent photo and video editor.                    The best smartphone I ever had, you are never going to regret for pruchase this phone best android experience I had                    Excellent display, fast and the lastes android update. Saddly no sd slot, but this is the price for google phone, happy to pay it                    You can buy it from google at $299, why would you pay more for the same phone here?That's ridiculous!                    Equivalent to smartphones that double the price.I't has everything you can find in the most expensive Samsung or Iphone.Cons: it's sooo good that most of the time it's sold out!
!###I BOUGHT THE MOBILE PHONE AND IT DOESN'T MAKE VOICE CALL.IS A TABLET.I WANT TO REPAIR THE PHONE.                    Got from Google play store 5 days ago, as compared to any iPhone, this device uses most cheaper and low grade materials.1.  The wall charger is making whistle buzz sound while plugin,  even continues 10 seconds after unplug.  Thought it's my bad luck. Go online search, a lot of people also complain the same problem.  Never see this happens to any other smart phones. Shame on Nexus 4.  This makes me worried if this device would last for 6 months.2. Poor Google customer service. When calling to ask for replacing only the wall charger, they would not decide right away, it takes a couple of days for them to offer returning the whole device for exchange, plus the device won't be available immediately. What a waste of time!3. Speaker in the back makes it impossible to hear sound while watching video if laying flat on the table.4. Ear phone is not included with the box. iPhone has it.  It's evident that Google is cutting corners.5. Device overheat easily when performing light tasks. It could be the design flaws of quadcore CPU.6. Battery life looks good on paper but lasts only 55% .7. Still buggy Andoid Jelly Bean OS.  When changing configurations or sim card, you have to power off first.  Crash is your daily meal...I buy a lot smart phones for myself and friends. Windows phone is the worst, this phone is second to the worst.  iPhone has best user satisfaction even though I try very hard to find iPhone alternative. However, iPhone is still ruling...Update 2/17/2013:A lot of online expert reviewers probably get paid by Google Inc and they don't tell the truth.  Here is another fact, if you buy it from Google Play Store,  in case if there're some defects, you return the product, it will take them 14 days or more to refund the money after receiving the phone, if  for exchange, you may get refurbished unit and have to wait several weeks without phone.                    I was really disappointed. that's not really good deal. i feel like I was deceived. I will not buy anything like this anymore
!###My Nexus works great.  I love getting the latest Android updates as soon as they are released without waiting for manufacturer/carrier branding.                    I'm going to keep my review short, sweet, and to the point. I didn't buy my Google Nexus 4 from Amazon. I bought mine from Google for more than one reason. The one reason there's the price point. Google sell the Nexus 4 8GB model for $299 and a 16GB model for $350. For the price at Amazon sells the 16GB model I got the 16GB model and the wireless charger from Google.Pro's:-Great specs-1.5Ghz Quad core processor-2GB of RAM-4.7 inch display (Not huge, but not small either. Just right)-Amazing price for the specs at $350 (from Google)-Factory unlocked-Latest version of Android 4.2.2-Will always update before other phones-Pure Vanilla version of android (meaning completely stock with no bloatware)Con's:-No LTE (only downfall)Conclusion:The only downfall to Google's flagship phone is that it doesn't have 4G LTE. That's not even entirely true. It does have an LTE chip built into it but 4.2.2 update killed it. You can still get 4G LTE if you really want to but it involves rooting it and installing a custom ROM on it (Not suggested cause it voids the warranty). For the price of this phone I highly suggest it more then a Galaxy S III.                    Out of all the smartphones I've used this one has the largest screen ever and it is very impressive. I bought mine through google play for 380.  Now I have to discuss some pros and cons about this device.Pros --1) Powerful machinery. 2GB RAM is the highest maximum in the cell phone industry as of now. You will not find any android device with more RAM.2) Powerful processor,  1.5 Ghz snapdragon is possibly one of the most powerful processors in the cell phone industry, with only 2 to 3 phones having more than this.3) Rooting not required. Due to such powerful machinery, the speed is incredibly fast. Hence rooting isn't required. The main purpose of rooting the device is to save RAM and CPU usage and to make the device faster. But since it already has such maximum capacity features, rooting isn't necessary here.4) Excellent call quality5) Huge screen. No problem seeing any website. The visual display is large and very generous. Iphone dipslay seems tight compared to this. For videos or website viewing, its simply awesome.Cons ---1) Due to its powerful machinery, the battery life isn't that good. Takes very long to charge to 100 percent. Can take hours in fact. Battery may diminish fast.  However that is not a problem for me because wherever I am I can either charge it through USB, wall outlet or car charger. If charging isn't available then I don't think the device can last longer than 3 hours.2) Holding it in one hand maybe a challenge at times due to its big screen size. May feel bulky too for 1 hand. At worst case, may give hand pain if holding with one hand continuously for long periods. You have to use both hands or give your hands some rest.3) 16 GB internal storage though ample, is not the industry max.  However industry max is 64 GB internal storage. With the RAM and processor being industry max, if the internal storage was 64 GB too then this phone would defeat any smartphone hands down.4) Comes with pre-loaded malware. After installing Kaspersky antivirus, it detected 3 backdoor viruses in it.  These 3 pieces of malware work as spyware.  So if you don't have antivirus, you must install it.  I believe they are intentionally inserted by google to spy upon.5) May appear to get quite warm at times. Won't stay cool always                    saludo desde venezuela muy recomendado producto es exelente gracias me encanta espero poder comprar otro en las siguientes oportunidades mas                    excelente producto llego en perfecta condiciones cien por ciento recomendado.muy buenos acabados, r&aacute;pido, resistente.... sin mas nada que decir me despido........                    As talked about, nexus 4 is one of the best mobile phone out there. I would have given it a 5 star if, the memory was expandable and, the battery was not BUILT into the phone. All in all, this is an excellent phone. I truely LOVE IT.                    My first Android phone!Did not like the speaker very much and the camera is not that good as the iphone 5.But imho I think it is a great deal!The android without the skins is very nice!                    It boasts great characteristics for a better price than other brands' flagship phones. The memory limit might be a problem in the future, but for now it is a great choice                    A very good phone, but the back glass is fagile.Very fast, the best android OS, always updated.I recomend, but take care with the back glass.                    Speaking from the standpoint of being somewhere between avid phone geek and mild mannered everyday consumer, and having used many of the mainstream and international devices, I can honestly say with good conscious that of all the phones I may have ever tested and used, the Nexus 4 is definitely in my top five favorites here's why:BUILD QUALITY:Overall, the build quality is solid. The Nexus 4 is similar to iPhone 4 and 4s in that both the front and back panels are glass. The outside edge seems to be made of a matte hard plastic but doesn't have a cheap feel to it. It's a very elegant looking device and while the glass front and back can cause some mild anxiety, a bumper can rectify any concerns you have. Also the Nexus 4 is thin and while the 4.7 inch display is large, the phone is really not that bulky. I have fairly small hands and didn't have too much issue using it with one hand semi-comfortably. The volume and power buttons are appropriately placed. There are no other capacitive buttons on the device.PERFORMANCE:The Nexus 4 running Jelly Bean 4.2.1 is blazing fast and fluid. Google did wonderful job with Jelly Bean. It's now much more fluid, lagless and robust as on OS overall. The on board quad core processor and 2GBs of RAM make for super fast loading of applications and content. So far, no force closes either.CALLS/DATA:Using it over T-Mobile's network, the Nexus 4 has been extremely fast. Web pages loaded in a 3-5 seconds and calls were clear. Since I've been using the Nexus 4 for the past two months, I haven't had a single dropped call.CAMERA:Although not one of the best cameras I've used on a mobile device, the camera will get the job done for quick capturing or video. The shutter time is about 1-2 seconds so no obnoxiously long waiting times.COOL STUFF:NFC - Near Field Communication - This allows for wireless charging and sharing with other devices that are NFC enabled. I own the LG Wireless Charging pad for my Nexus 4... GREAT STUFF! And it's awesome to be able to share pictures, files, etc. without needing an App and simply by touching devices.COMPLAINTS:The sound driver in the Nexus 4 must be super small because the sound quality through headphones is absolutely dreadful, although through speakers, it's great. Also, the only complaint I have about Android OS is that in the GMail App, you can select all emails and mark all as read... a very minor complaint but something useful none the less. Also, no expandable memory or included earbuds.CONCLUSION:Should the average consumer grab this device? Absolutely... for a $299 outright price point all while being a competitor in terms of specs with the iPhone 5 and the Samsung Galaxy SIII, unless you really have a disdain for Android OS, you can't go wrong with the  Nexus 4. Also, because it's a Nexus device, it will receive "special attention" in terms of updates from Google. It's an excellent device. Google and LG have proven that they can break barriers without breaking pockets.It's just a really, really good device.
!###The device is nice, fast and came with Pure Android OS.There are only 2 downsides:First and more serious, the battery is not so good (I know we are talking about a SmartPhone, but this one has a very weak battery). I solved this problem buy more charges (I have 1 at home, 1 at work, 1 in my car and another in my back pack).The second problem is about the storage. My 16GB is almost full. For now it is ok, but I don't know what I'm going to do if Google does not launch a 32GB in the next iteration of Nexus line. I need more storage.Everything else is amazing on this device.                    I loved nexus 4, it's a very good phone for the price. Despite it doesn't have 4G, what I can't understand since the previoues nexus has, the phone is well built, beultiful, very quick, and has the last version of android which I think is geting each time better. I found it a bit expensive comparing to google play, but I have to buy on Amazon, cause google don't accept my international credit card (non US).Pros:- Gorgeous phone- Well built- Very quick- Very good for the price (cheaper on google play if you have US credit card)- Awesome screen resolutionCons:- Doesn't have 4G (previous version galaxy nexus had)- Doesn't come with earbuds- Doesn't expand memory (what was not necessary until now)- has a multicolor led for notifications which I can't find anywhere what they mean (each color is for sms, e-mail, twitter, etc...)                    This is the second time I have a Nexus phone from Google and I can tell you there is nothing like a &#34;pure&#34; Android without the all the customizations like TouchWiz, and other customizations that the other makers normally do, like replacing android stock apps such as desk clock, music player, market and car dock by their own crappy versions.The interface is smooth, and battery life is good .... 1.5 days normally, which lasts 50% more than my previous Samsung Note and my wife's S3.                    great design, light, fast, unlocked.I use a screen protector. it looks very easy to scratch.android 4.2.2 updated by Google.requires microsim.don't have external storagecan't take off the battery if it ever comes to get locked                    A great phone that does everything I need from it.Good camera, good battery, great screen and a wonderful phone in all.                    It's the only android  phone with &#34;zero lag&#34; using it, that i know.It makes Galaxy S3 look like an ancient phone. Very similar to an iPhone 5  but without IOS restrictions.Great screen, average battery. Good reception. Instant Google updates, etcThe only real downside is the storage. 16GB without SD expansion slot, may be a deal breaker for some people.I understand that Google hopes you use all their cloud services. But there are situations when you don't have access to a good data network.                    I had Samsung S and was expecting a huge deference going to Nexus but sadly it wasn't.The phone is good but not up to the price i payed for it                    My first impression of this phone are very positive. My only question has to do with the power button, which seems a bit awkward. For now I am very satisfied with my Nexus 4                    Google is the best! I'm a nexus fan and I bought this phone because Google ensures its update. A good price with the latest technology, certainly recommend it.                    I finally got nexus 4 on my hand!My previous cell phones were galaxy S, Iphone 3gs, and I have a Ipod 5g. So I have used a smart phone for a long time.But! nexus 4 is hard for me to adjust. It is slightly different in UI and some settings from the other android phones.Except that point, which I am going to be accustomed to , overall performance and feature of the phone is great!And delivery was so fast. I can get the package just in two days, even though I selected a standard shipping option.
!###Let me start by saying I love this phone!  When my G2X met with an unfortunate accident in a cave, I went to T-Mobile and they sold me this one.  I was in love!  Come to find out, though, you can get one from google a lot cheaper.  Here is the run down:Bought from T-Mobile$200 down payment$20 per month for 20 months=$400Total: $600Bought from Google$350 for phone$28 for shipping and taxTotal: $378Difference: $222(Other perk is that by buying from Google, I would not be renewing my contract with T-Mobile)Difference between purchasing fromUnfortunately, I had already bought the phone from T-Mobile when I found out that Google sold it so much cheaper.  I was within the 14-day return period with T-Mobile, so I returned the phone to them and had to pay a $50 restocking fee.  I STILL ended up saving a lot of money!  And why is T-Mobile charging such an outrageous price for this same phone?It is very easy switching out the SIM card, if you want to do it yourself.  Google ships the phone with the ejection tool, and my phone booted itself up and recognized itself as a T-Mobile phone in minutes.The phone itself is awesome.  The screen is sharp and bright, it is FAST, not as buggy as my old phone...basically everything you could ever want in a phone for an amazing price.                    Excellent phone. Great features. Very fast. Very sleek. Good camera. Good battery life. Only disadvantage is lack of memory card slot.                    I tried an android phone before, but i decided that its time to change from an iphone to a bigger nicer phone, this phone is amazing i cant put it down. really love it                    Its the first time that I use a pure android phone....an let me tell you that It's great!!! Good sound, good display, good camera, and it will have all the new android versions of at least 5 years...It its a powerful phone so it can run A LOT OF APPS!! You won't regret it!!!                    This is a wonderful phone. I have used Nexus 3 and 3.5 before. This is another great phone from Google.Excellent High resolution displayIt has a quad core chipset so its super fast.Latest OS Jelly Bean 4.2 - bang for the buck.Its very comfortable to hold and it still fits in your pocketYou can use wireless charger with this phone.                    Pros:-OS: Android 4.2.1 (and recently 4.2.2) simply flies on this phone. Great use of the quad core processor.-Display: It's not the fanciest screen on the market, but it looks great. Even with sunlight I can see it well.-Form/Feel: I love the size of this phone. It remains light while being slightly (not much) thicker than an S3, and it just seems easier to hold. Especially nice with the optional bumper accessory.-Look: It's just a beautiful looking phone. Front to back.-Wireless charging.-Call quality: Sounds great!Cons:-Extensions: Lack of them.. no SD slot. But 16 GB, plus cloud storage (like instant photo upload to G+) makes it fine.-Camera: It's not bad, but it's not that great either. I feel it could do a little better in lower light, at least when I compare it to iphone and S3 cameras.-Battery: The life isn't great, it's pretty typical for android quite frankly. I always have chargers around. But I don't like that I can't take it out and replace it. That's just lame...-No LTE support: It's not that critical, but I do miss having LTE speeds (came from an S3).Overall this is a really solid, and super fast phone. It's a wonderful way to experience pure android and I think anyone looking for an unlocked phone is getting a fantastic option, especially at Google's price.                    This phone without doubt is the best phone I have ever owned.Stock android is the only way to go, tons of features quick updates to new firmware versions & beautiful user interface.The phone itself is of a very high build quality and is quite sturdy despite the glass front and back, I have dropped the phone a number of times from 3ft or less onto a tiled surface and no dents of scratches anywhere. The only issues in my opinion are the lack of expandable storage capacity and the non-removable battery.Overall extremely happy with the phone, no regrets.                    I finally got the N4 to connect to Sams Club wifi, but it seemed like a slow non-intuitive process with no feedback about what the N4 was doing. I request that someone try an N4 at Sams Club or a wifi WalMart. They will then probably experience this issue first hand, and be able to suggest a method that allows for a speedier connection. Sams Clubs (and many WalMarts) imho are some of the better free wifi spots, and of course they are all over the country.The big delay seems always to be associated with the N4 not being able to handle the splash or welcoming screen you always get at a  free wifi spot. Sometimes the splash screen doesn't appear (or it takes a long time for it to appear). Once it appears and you accept the terms and click on the connect button, the N4 wants to do weird things like save the image of the button, start a new page or tab, etc...I had no confidence the N4 was even trying to connect, and no feedback on what it was doing. When I successfully connected I left the N4 run for what seemed like minutes and lo and behold when I checked again it had connected. By comparison an Apple iphone 3gs connected in seconds.Afaik there is no solution to the inability of the N4 to connect to ad hoc wifi networks. Does this mean no one at Nexus is willing to explore this long standing issue?Other than this the N4 seems great. For those of you who don't make very many calls and want a very inexpensive no contract service, you can go with att Jolt for $3/mo or tmo Spot Mobile for $1.7/mo. I'm using Jolt Mobile and the voice quality is excellent. I can make free Talkatone calls or texts when on wifi. Both of the mentioned mvnos are 10 cents a minute for voice.Except for the above issues which should have simple solutions (but who knows), I'm liking my N4 more and more. Primarily it's the value, state of the art technology, speed, and smoothness which are convincing me.Rob                    this phone is wonderful i was using the galaxy nexus where it was nice with some issues like camera ..sound ...and screenthe nexus 4 brought from google and they solve all the previous problem of the galaxy nexus ...the sound is perfect..screen is wonderful and camers is very nice and the issue only is the battery i would like google to release an update that solve the battery drain its only last for 8 to 9 hours only this is while 3G is working with normal calls and an average using of internet                    The phone is exactly what I was looking for. It's elegant, fast and is guaranteed to have OS updates at least for 3 more years before having to fall back on custom ROMS for updates.It's a tad expensive when bought outside the Google Play Store, but considering that site isn't is available on my country, then I have to be content with being able to get the phone at all!I will miss having upgradable storage (no microSD slot here) but besides that, this is a great purchase!
!###Great return for the money.Bad things:1. Speaker is very low quality.2. Everything simple is not simple - for example using the device as a mp3 player is a nightmare! this simple use case hasn't been solved by google and LG. Shame!Very quality device for the cheap price.I bought it but still using my iPhone because it doesn't serve me as I expected.                    I do not have much to add to the existing reviews concerning the features of this phone. I really liked it ! However, since I was used to have a super-strong Nokia E71 phone, I broke the screen of the Nexus 4 after dropping it from 1 meter high on the ground after 3 days. I felt very stupid until I realized I was not the only one to have this problem. It seems that the glass screen is thinner than what can be found on other phones, making it VERY fragile.Conclusion: Thanks Google, but I will never buy LG again.                    Previous review was premature. I rated it low and later found that the initial error was my own. I withdraw my review and reserve the right to comment on this product at a later date.                    It's a great mobile phone. But I guess it's missing support for bluetooth 4.0. I bought a device supporting bluetooth 4.0 and I can't pair it with my Nexus 4.                    Received this the other day... It's my wife's phone.Price is finally comparable to GPS.Pros:1.  Super bright display... Even outdoors.  That's important for using the camera... I had an older HTC that was too dim.  Could barely see the camera soft button.2.  Price.  For an unlocked new phone, price is hard to beat3.  Fast.  Very responsive.  Loads of RAM that will allow this phone to handle fat apps for the next several yearsCon's:1.  Only one con... The usable display is not 4.7 inches because of the soft nav buttons.  But when watching Netflix, the nav buttons disappear and the result is a 4.7 inch screen.  But for web during, etc, the screen feels more like a 4.3 inch that my retired HTC Inspire 4G had.  One star off for that.Other than that, it ia s very nice phone.-T                    Great phone but Google is selling their phone direct for less than if you buy it from Amazon.  Google told me that I might have to wait two weeks for my Nexus 4 but for lots less money that seemed OK.  I got mine in two days, not two weeks.Be sure to get a bumper to protect the phone.  I got one with a back cover so I could store other SIM cards and the key for the SIM card drawer.                    I recently bought the Lg Nexus 4, and I really like it. This phone is really fast and handle very well multitasking. The fisical appearance of the phone is really nice, with gorilla glass 2 on the screen and the back of the phone. What I really don't like, it's that sometimes with a little extra use the phone start to heat up.But after everything is a really good phone with an incredible screen                    Not much negative to say about this phone. Love the quad core super quickness of this phone. Apps are ready and loaded in super fast time.  Ex., I can be playing a game, answer an incoming call, and after hanging up goes right back to app/game.  Power cycles quickly. Has yet to freeze up or have any major foul ups in the month I have been using it.  Everything a smart phone should be, and isn't anything it shouldn't be, and at a very smart price.  I believe I may be a nexus google (or variant thereof) user for life now.  Screw you I-phone! lol                    I recommend this phone to everyone because it's supported by google in the way that new os releases will be delivered directly to your phone with the propper os update and without the need of a carrier or manufacturer os update, that in real life, it never happens. It has a very good performance in games, networking apps and office apps.                    This is really good product in decent price. Loved the performance of the gadget, supercool looks and awesome packaging as well.I would like to recommend this product to friends and family.
!###I'm a regular iPhone user, but I always own the latest greatest vanilla Android so I can keep my knowledge fair and equal. I've owned every Google vanilla phone since Google started with the Nexus One. This hardware with the latest OS is the first time I've felt really comfortable and ready to switch. The apps I use are also finally usable enough and in the right place that I could do it with little heartburn.Because this phone and the previous phone, Galaxy Nexus both support the latest edition of Android OS, my main objective is to tell you what I like about this phone better. It's simple-- the edge of the phone has a really nice bevel to grip it. The Galaxy Nexus has a pretty smooth edge which requires you to "cup it" in your hand and sometimes use two hands is easiest. This phone has a nice bevel to keep it gripped in the hand so there is no issue holding it.From a performance perspective I should notice a marked increase from the Galaxy Nexus but I'll be honest-- this is not something I noticed. It may be that I simply didn't use in extreme ways to prove this difference.That all being said, in my opinion this is superior hardware experience to the Galaxy Nexus, but I wouldn't hesitate to go with the Galaxy Nexus if cost is an issue/focus.                    After a very long wait and searching endlessly through markets I was able to find one of these beauties and decided to let you guys know about it so here it goes.The Good:Performance: The Nexus 4 has a 1.5GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor with 2GB of RAM. The iPhone 5, by comparison, has a 1.3GHz Apple A6 chip with 1GB of RAM, so you can see that this is indeed a powerful machine.Build Quality: The nexus 4 feels great in the hand, it has a gorgeous screen with a glass leaded back and has a better build than any Android smartphone I have seen, although you might want to keep it away from concrete at all costs.Customization: Android is a highly customizeable OS out there because users have more control over the OS unlike iOS, so for an intermediate to advanced user Android is the way to go, but if you are a new Smartphone user you should try checking out iPhone 5Flexibility: If you live anywhere outside of the US and especially in a third world country where you markets are full of cheap android tablets then you are in luck as this IS the most powerful and economical Android phone to date and you can use it with any of those cheap tablets to achieve a lot of functions at a very low cost.Updates: This smartphone has the latest 4.2 OS which is not available on any other mobile and nexus 4 will get all the Android updates faster then any other Android phone as there is no modification needed before the release of the update i.e. when Samsung etc get an update they then have to modify it for their Touchwiz OS and then modify is again for some specific devices. Nexus 4 however doesn't need all this and as soon as the update is out from Google it can be installed without any modificationsPrice: The price of the stock device from Google is 350$ which is WAY less then any other device of similar specs and size.The Bad:Price: Yes I have included the price in the good section but I am also including this in the bad section because as you can see you are not paying the stock price for this on Amazon but over 500$ which is a lot.Strange Noise Issue: There have been cases(not with me) of buzzing noise coming from the phones earpiece in the earlier models but seems to be fixed in the newer ones, so be careful before you get one.LTE: There is not LTE capability on this device so if you use LTE you should try looking at the iPhone 5 or the Galaxy S III.Lack of MicroSD: there is not space for e micro SD card so you cannot add more storage space and are pretty much stuck with the storage space you buy.                    So I read all the reviews and decided to order the 16 GB Nexus 4 from the Play Store site, even though it said 5-6 weeks wait.Sure enough, it shipped the next day, had it in 2 days.  And I am very very happy.I use it with the Walmart $45 a month Straight Talk plan (from Tracfone).  A $15 mini SIM card put me on the AT&T network - no contract.The lightness and shape of the phone, the speed of the processor, the size and clarity of the screen, the improvements that come with Android 4.2, including strong voice recognition - all strong pluses.  There is no LTE, but web searches, etc. seem to happen pretty quickly with this phone.  An oddity - there are no instructions for use of the camera in the manual or anywhere online.  But the camera takes great pics.  Oh and the battery seems like it lasts for a while - although it is not user replaceable.This is a great phone - a no contract, lower cost equivalent to the iPhone 5 and the Galaxy S3.                    The white Nexus 4 that i bought directly from Google does not look like the picture for this product the amazon have. Only the back of the phone is white, and the front is black. Other than that this phone is superb.I love everything about it and i have no complaints. I made a video of this phone for you who are looking to buy this phone, its an up close view of the phone to see what comes in the box and what the phone looks like.http://youtu.be/TnVWq1gThzA                    I am tech guy. I love new gadgets and I love anything related to technology. With that said, when the Nexus 4 was announced it intrigued me. I've tried Android about 2 years ago on a Galaxy S phone and wasn't impressed. I wasn't sure if it was the operating system itself or the experience that was given through the Galaxy S phone.When the Nexus 4 became available again on the PLAY store I decided to order a 16 GB model. For only $50 more I felt it was worth the upgrade. The phone arrived on Monday, February 4th. I was excited for it's arrival as I was anxious to see if the Nexus Android experience would lure me away from my iPhone 5. I've been using iOS for several years and while the simple interface of icons did bore me a bit, the phone did everything I needed and more.PROS -There as much to like about this phone. When I unboxed it, the large display instantly grabbed me. I was excited to try a phone that was a bit larger. I unboxed and powered it up. I didn't have a micro-SIM card so I couldn't start using it right away (the iPhone 5 has a nano-SIM). I set everything else up and connected to WiFi. I started configuring all my accounts, apps, etc. I came across some issues but overall it was nice.Screen (4.7") - The screen on this phone is very nice. I don't feel the quality is the same as an iPhone 5, but it's definitely one of the best on the market. It's larger, but not huge like the Galaxy Note  and Note 2. It's also one piece of glass on the front of this phone so there are no grooves are indention's of any type.Customization - One of the biggest things Android fans talk about is the customization that is possible in the Android operating system. The possibilities are endless, of course, having the time to play with these options is another story. You can almost do anything you'd like if you take the time to find the settings and/or app that will allow you to do it. You can also load custom ROMs and root your phone to allow more options. I did not go that far with this phone as I really didn't have the time or the need, but the possibility is there.Android OS directly from Google - The main reason I chose the Nexus 4 was because I liked the fact that the operating system was provided by Google and wasn't junked up with any added interface like HTC, Motorola and Samsung like to do. It's a pure Google experience with OS updates directly from Google and quicker than any other phone. Android 4.2 really is the best Android OS to date. The options are endless, the system seems more refined than past versions and overall it's a needed and very nice improvement.CONS -As a user of iOS, many Android fans would call me a simple minded person. I take that as a complement. I love technology and I love playing with new gadgets, but for some reason, when it comes to my phone I just want it to work and do what I need it to do. There were several situations that I came across that prevented me from doing what I wanted. Here they are:Battery Life - Far and away the most frustrating part of using the Nexus 4 was the battery life. With my iPhone 5, I was accustomed to getting almost two full days of battery life out of my phone. There were many occasions where when I layed down for bed at 10 PM my phone would be at 53%. This was not the case with the Nexus 4. My battery died every day anywhere from 3-5 PM. I spent several hours tweaking and configuring settings on my phone. I turned the brightness of the screen down to 10%, I turned off unnecessary features like NFC, bluetooth, cellular data when not needed and wifi. I disabled all widgets, I turned off syncing of many apps except email. I essentially turned my phone into a dumbphone by disabling all the things we love to have with our smartphones. Even with all of this, I still was lucky to have 10% battery life by 6 PM. This was unacceptable in my mind and was a big drawback to using this phone.Earpiece and Speaker Volume - Another big issue I came across was when I was speaking to anyone whether it was on speakerphone or via the earpiece I could barely hear them. I spoke with several people ranging from landlines, to iPhones to Android phones to basic flip phones. It was all the same. The volume was up to the max and I could barely here them. The speaker volume was exactly the same, which leads me to my next issue...Speaker Placement - I will never understand why LG and Google decided to put the speaker on the back of this phone. This really diminished the audio quality of watching videos/movies or talking to someone on speaker phone. I found that whenever I used speaker I had to be very careful how I held the phone or where I placed the phone or the sound would either be very low and/or very muffled. This is a serious design flaw in my opinion.Notifications - I know that the Android notification system is loved by many, but personally I did not like it. Perhaps I'm too accustomed to iOS notifications, but I personally don't like to have all my notifications pop up on the top of the phone. It's great for text messages and missed phone calls, but I didn't want all my e-mails to show up, all my google voice calls and texts and others. I realize I could turn these off, but with iOS I could actually have a badge show up on the app showing that I have a notification for that app. Nothing more, nothing less. I simply would open the app when ready and check what it is. I prefer this method because I use my Google Voice account for business and didn't want to be bothered with notifications all the time, but did like to know when something was there for me to check when I had a chance.Apps - The Play store has many apps to choose from and I like the changes that have been made in the transition from Market to Play. Unfortunately, the quality of the apps was very poor in my opinion. I use a variety of different apps, utilities and games. Many of the apps I used (particularly banking apps) were very poor quality. They were clunky and looked unfinished and many were very unstable. They stopped responding, they crashed, etc. When browsing the Play store, having to sort through the junk apps to find higher quality apps is another bother. I realize you have junk apps on iOS too, but I noticed far too many apps that did not apply to what I was searching fro when browsing the Play store. I know that Android is capable of having a smooth interface and app experience, but it's up to the developers to refine their app and that clearly didn't happen on the apps I used.Size - I listed this as a  pro, but I found it to also be a con. Here's why: I'm not a small guy - 6'1" and 190 lbs. My hands are average size and I found the phone to be difficult to hold at times. I loved the large screen, but the comfort level of holding a 4.7" screen is not very good. I nearly dropped the phone on several occasions, and did not like the feel of the phone in my front pocket (how I carry all my phones). I prefer on handed operation on many occasions, but found that wasn't possible with this phone for most of the things I did.LTE (or lack thereof) - Obviously, I knew this phone was lacking LTE when I purchased it. I've read many reviews and everyone said that while it doesn't have LTE, it still was fast enough to get the job done. My provider is AT&T and I saw a huge speed difference in the iPhone 5 and the Nexus 4. The iPhone 5 was constantly grabbing 40 Mbps down while using LTE. I was lucky to get 2-3 Mbps on the Nexus 4. I don't blame the Nexus 4 entirely for this as I understand that it's the AT&T network more than anything, but the phone is lacking the latest technology (for many reasons, some out of Google's power) and that hurts it's functionality and value in my mind. Streaming video on LTE is like no other. It's faster than my home WiFi and is very smooth. HSPA+ on AT&T and the Nexus 4 felt very bogged down and slow.CONCLUSION -After spending about a week with the Nexus 4, I decided to go back to to the iPhone 5. I enjoyed using Android and enjoyed a lot that this phone had to offer, but the battery life was one of the biggest problems with using this phone. It's a shame, as this phone has a lot of potential. My experience is going to be different than everyone else, but I hope that this review will help others decide whether or not the Nexus 4 will fit their needs.EDIT (3/1/2013): I would just like to comment on the customer service I received from the Google Play store. For a company the size of Google, their customer service experience was quite pathetic. I returned the phone on February 11th and it was received by Google on February 14th. I have been calling to inquire about the refund as I fell within the 15 day return period. I wasn't able to get much information from anyone other than "they would reach out to a specialists to follow up". I have finally received notice today my refund is being processed (3/1/2013). A full two weeks (10 business days) to process a refund is absurd, but perhaps it's because I'm spoiled by companies like Amazon who process refunds within two business days of receiving an item, but usually even quicker than that.                    I've held off buying a smart phone for several reasons, not the least of which is cost.  The amount that service providers charge monthly for contracts is enough to choke a horse.  But now, here comes an unlocked phone that you can buy for a lot less than anything comparable, that can use either Straight Talk or T-Mobile's pre-paid services (45 and 30 dollars per month respectively) among others.  So, what about the phone?  It feels good in my hand, even with the i-Blason SoftGel Flexible TPU Case for Google Nexus 4 Smart Phone by EG E960 8GB 16GB (Frost Black) I bought for it. I'm slightly hard of hearing, so a really good speakerphone is important to me.  The Nexus 4's is very good.  As is the regular call quality.  And my old Jabra headset paired up just fine for those calls into customer service centers or other places where you sometimes have to strain to hear.In reading reviews, I constantly came up with two complaints.  No USB storage and no 4G.  Well, a lot of the software sits in Google's cloud.  As does a copy of my music collection that I can download to the phone if I want to listen offline.  Further (and I don't know how long it'll last), I got a free 50 Gig of storage on Box.com.  What's more, for about 4 bucks I can get a Zuweiyu USB 2.0 A Female to Micro B Male Adapter Cable Micro USB Host Mode OTG Cable that allows me (with a Google app) to use a thumb drive or a portable hard drive.  As for the speed, I'm using Straight Talk and the response speed while using the phone is comparable to using the same apps over wifi.  How fast it'll download a file, I can't say, 'cause I've only download when I'm attached to a wifi network.  But that might be a problem for anyone without access to a secure wifi environment.The best parts for me are the start-up speed (about .5 seconds) and the screen.  The screen is simply gorgeous.  I'd considered a Sammy SIII, but with all those reviews reporting a darkish screen... anyway, the Nexus 4 has a truly outstanding display.  I can read very well using a Kindle app, and Netflix is crystal clear.The phone uses a micro-sim card (GSM) that you need to get separately from the prepaid carrier of your choice.  It took Straight Talk about five days to get me the sim card.  The Nexus itself showed up the day after I got the Google Play Store e-mail announcing it had been shipped.I want to stress that part of the reason I give the phone a 5 star rating is because I will *not be a heavy user of data or calls or texts. My needs are more moderate. Therefore, my emphasis is on picture quality, screen sharpness, easy to hear volume levels and quality construction.  I find the Nexus 4 more than meets my needs and I find the phone itself attractive.  Did I mention it's also comparatively inexpensive to buy and use?Update:  I've also purchased this little Anker® SlimTalk 3200mAh Backup External Battery Pack Charger with Embedded Micro-USB and Flashlight for iPhone 5 4S 4 3GS, iPod (OEM CABLE REQUIRED for Apple); Android Phones: Samsung Galaxy S3, Galaxy S2, Galaxy Nexus, Galaxy Note / HTC One X One S Sen...].  I charged my Sammy dumb phone from about half full and the Nexus 4 from about half full, and there was still enough charge in the Anker external battery to recharge the Nexus once more from empty.1/19/2013: Edited to add that the on the go USB option is NOT currently available.  But the problem is solved with the Flixter app, Ultraviolet and Vudu.  I signed up for disk to digital, took 10 movies to Walmart, and had them registered for 20 bucks which got me another ten titles I didn't get to choose.  Let me tell you that the movies in SD on the Nexus 4 are simply stunning.  I also purchased a pair of Motorola S305 Bluetooth Stereo Headset w/ Microphone (Black) - Retail Packaging which entirely compliment the incredible picture on the screen.I'm also finding that from grocery shopping to being aware of weather alerts through various apps available at Google Play, I'm using the Nexus way more than I anticipated.  For instance, I stream tons of music while driving.  So, now I can tell you that the battery lasts all day - even when using a golf GPS app (golf takes about 4 hours to play 18 holes).  I'm still glad I bought the back-up battery, but I've only needed it once.  That despite using the phone up to seven hours a day.  I do charge it every night, but on light use I could get away with skipping a night.With all the cloud storage available from Audible, Google Music, books, movies, magazines, Amazon music, movies, Kindle and the Flixter/Ultraviolet/Vudu combination, about the only things stored permanently on the phone are about 100 songs, 70 apps, an Audible book, a Kindle book or 60 and maybe 50 photos and three videos (the camera in combination with the Snapseed app is spectacular!), 1 of which is a full-length Hollywood title.  That, believe it or not, still leaves me almost two thirds of the on-phone storage available!If I were going to buy another phone right now, I wouldn't bother considering anything but A Google Nexus 4 which has enhanced my life way beyond any expectations I had going in.Oh yeah.  The 4G thing?  Don't worry about it.  I simply cannot tell the difference in the performance of the phone whether I'm using Wifi or my data plan.  It is as fast as my two year old Acer Aspire running Win 7 and 4 Gig of Ram.  It has never so much as stuttered under any conditions.                    The guy who said it may not be the best phone, but the best bang for your buck has it right.Sure, the specs on the pixel density & screen resolution are slightly worse than the other top phones out there (although barely if at all noticeable to the naked eye).  And 32GB's would be nice.At the end of the day how much is this stuff worth to you?  For me maybe a hundred bucks or two.  Certainly not $800 which is about what I'm saving over two years by buying from Google unlocked plus a terrific prepaid plan from T-Mobile.  Maybe half that if I upgrade to the next Nexus in another year, which btw will likely have all the missing features mentioned above.Google, T-Mobile, and I would all like to thank Verizon for making me a new customer and saving lots of dough.  If VZ had offered the HTC One or come out with a good Nokia Lumia sooner I wouldn't have bothered to do the research on this beauty & would've continued paying thru the nose for minutes I don't use, annoying contracts, and outlandish bloatware.  If you live in North Dakota I guess you don't have a choice, but if you're in a major metro area where just about every carrier offers decent reception?  This phone is a no-brainer if you just want a good functional device with some cutting edge stuff, but aren't obsessed with the latest&greatest (if you are you have to switch phones every 6 months).To my surprise I don't find it all that difficult to use either, even though I am not the techie type.  Pretty much got everything down within a couple days (except for the camera which I haven't explored much) including 5 different wallpapers & apps/settings etc.  Google Now is pretty much the coolest thing ever.  So long Big Red, it's been real.                    Good solid build. Fast processor and more than enough RAM. Android 4.2.2 OTA complete and it's a very smooth ride. Beautiful design and a lovely glass back. Remember to buy a good case to protect the phone.Was overly expensive at Amazon while stock was limited. Now (post Feb 2013) it's available at a decent price. The 16GB version is best as you only get 12GB available (hence the 8GB would be very limited)Only issues I would raise would be that it does not have a memory expansion slot and a bigger battery. The battery does tend to get used up pretty quickly if you are on 3G data. I generally keep settings at 2G data (for incoming mail, and other instant alerts) and use WiFi whenever available for faster Internet. This way the battery does last longer and you can get though a day and half.The only other phone currently I would consider is the Sammy Galaxy S3, but for the price (approx USD 400) the Nexus 4/16GB is a win and I would say even better. Very happy with the experience.                    I am happy to own Nexus 4 smartphone and I bought it at a higher price than available at google just because it was out of stock on google and I just dont want to wait.It is a amazing phone with sleek design (better than Galaxy s3), powerful quad core processor and 2 GB RAM which is the main reason for me to buy because I had Samsung Galaxy earlier which was awefully slow.With Nexus you dont have to worry about speed and also since it has clean untampered android OS which can automatically update before any other brand android phone can.                    PROS:- superb build quality!- gorgeous looking- unique....trust me, this looks like nothing else out there- beautiful display- nice weight and solid feel in the hand- stock android jellybean with no bloatware- super fast! everything happens instantly- decent camera- good call qualityCONS:- no LTE- no SD card capability (if you store large amts of media, 16GB may run out quickly)- battery life is mediocre (struggles to get through a day with average use of wifi, HSPA+, few games etc)
!###This phone is absolutely amazing! Super fast and gorgeous to look at. My sister bought a Samsung S3 at the same time and since that was originally my first choice I compared a little. The S3 has a lot of extras that I thought I would be jealous of but i'm not. The Nexus interface is sooo much better looking that touchwiz which looks really cheesy. I also definitely love the build quality compared to the S3. I'll update after I have really gotten to spend some time with my new baby :)UPDATE:I have used this phone for six months now and can comment on the following:Build Quality:My Nexus 4 still looks brand new months later! She has taken a few tumbles, some with a case on and some without (not hard these times though)and im pleased to say that the glass is definitely not as fragile as first so those phones must have been defective.Call Quality:Pretty good. I've never had a problem hearing or being heard during a call. And the speakerphone volume is excellent and can be heard clear acrosss a room. I also haven't had much problems with calls dropping or signal strength with the phone (that couldn't be attributed to our HORRIBLE (and sadly only) cellular service provider.Camera:I was so excited to get my hands on this phone to play around with 360 panoramic pictures but funny enough I did it once when I first got it and barely even remember the feature most days.The camera is definitely meh. I think it's the Nexus' biggest flaw. It takes pretty good pictures in bright light but if the lighting is uneven my pictures tend to come out looking very pixelated(?), especially when zoomed in. Also colors almost always looked washed out when taken with this camera so I recently downloaded a HDR Camera app to try help matters a bit. And btw you're definitely not getting a good lowlight camera here.Having upgraded from a Nokia N8, which beat my panasonic point and shoot by a mile, I guess I maybe needed to adjust my expectations a little and remember it's a phone not a camera.Bluetooth:If anyone can figure out how to bluetooth a song on this phone then PLEASE let me know! I had to download an app to be able to do it and it's a bit tedious.Screen:Gorgeous!!! I find myself cleaning the screen like 4 times a day. It is beautiful but more importantly it feels awesome under your fingertips. I have not been able to bring myself to buy a screen protector(fingerprints) to this day.Responsiveness:Very fast!!!!!! Minimal to no lag and i'm more than half way through my memory with over a hundred apps.Sensor:The sensor is very sensitive and sometimes the screen will go black and I will get totally scared until I realize that something(my hand, a piece of paper or once I swear it was just a few wisps of hair) is hovering over the screen.All in all I still love my Nexus 4! It does everything I need it to and more and I still recommend it to all my friends, especially with it's awesome price point just remember it's still not without it's minor flaws.                    It is a four-and-a-half star product. My only quibble till now is with the picture quality: a 100% zoom will clearly show lots of noise, and the color saturation is a bit off. For the rest of it, it is a great product - just read all the glowing reviews all over the net. My concern, however, is that sellers on Amazon are jacking up the list price fictitiously and then purporting to sell these phones to you at the "discounted" prices of $550-#600, when you can buy the same phone directly from Google for $349 (for the more expensive 16GB model).                    I see a lot of great reviews here and I agree with most of the comments. The phone is amazing and the stock apps and features are fantastic. The downside is the battery life. You hardly get 2.5 hours of screen time before it goes from 100 to 0 % if you use it continuously. With very sparse use - around 30 minutes talk time, 20 minutes of mail  the battery still drains to 0% in about 8 hours, most often requiring 2 charges per day (you can see that the OS is using up most of the battery life). At this rate the 800 charge cycles will get used up in a years time before the battery starts to degrade. And then it does not come with a replaceable battery nor replacing it looks easy. There are tons of battery woes posted on XDA and Other Android forums. If Google can somehow solve this problem, it will be the best phone ever for its price.                    This phone only carries a warranty is purchase through google play!  My phone is 3 months old and Google told me they could not cover the phone for repairs, even though it was deemed defective.  They told me to contact LG, which I did and they informed me that they no longer warranty this phone!!  They owners manual states that LG will guarantee the phone for 12 months from the purchase date put this is no longer so.  You have to send them the phone with $75 and they will give you an estimate for the repair.  The $75 will be deducted from any costs.  In other words, they have your phone hostage.  DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.  THIS IS BAD BAD BUSINESS.  I AM SO TRULY DISAPPOINTED!  $385 FOR A USELESS PIECE OF PLASTIC!!! SHAME ON YOU LG AND SHAME ON YOU GOOGLE PLAY.  AMAZON PLEASE DISCONTINUE SELLING THIS PRODUCT!!!                    Nexus 4 looks, feels and works perfectly. Won't be able to make full and worthy review here and now, so I won't. You can check the rich resources out there on the internet.Let's not forget about the seller. I received this great smart phone and very quick safe delivery for very reasonable price. I'd love to shop from this seller again.                    LG is a warranty of cell phones with all the advanced technology available. A phone that facilitates the use of its functions without problem on any server ....                    I love this phone. It's easy to use, I can back up everything, everything backs up automatically. My biggest complaints are that it is fragile and that sometimes sync can be a little flaky. When my navigation was updated to Google maps it took me a bit to get used to it. I love that all my updates are automatic!                    My phone behaved like I was tapping or touching the top of the screen all the time. No screen protector in use, removed the case, reboot the phone, updated Android and all the apps, reset to factory settings, cleaned the screen, and the problem kept returning. Sometimes the phone would work (so I could apply the updates), but the top of the screen seemed disabled (I could not pull down the notification list, for example). If I opened an application (chrome, for example) and rotated the phone, I would regain control over the notification list, but the side of the screen which was originally up remained disabled.I failed to find similar complaints in forums and reviews, so I think this issue was specific to my unit.The two star rating is because I think I would like the phone if it actually worked.I returned the phone.                    This phone has the best price / quality ratio. The only cons I found is the Gorilla Glass which is not so strong.                    It's just wonderful, all that Nexus line with pure android has to offer. The best phone I've ever had, fast, beautiful and usual. Just one little regret about they battery, but this is a common problem on smartphones.
!###Blah blah blah blah... If you're reading this, you've probably seen quite a few reviews of this phone already... It's a Nexus phone people! You get the latest Android updates! (Jelly Bean is snappin fast!), it's stock Android, which means you won't get any of the additions of any other company (Touchwiz-Samsung, sense-HTC.... you name it)Plus, the specs... 2 GB of RAM, quad core processor.This phone is freakin FAST! No lags when loading apps, multitasking is a breeze, and it's just so easy to work on this phone, and do whatever you want to do with it! In terms of putting apps, downloading stuff, etc. This phone will do the job just fine.Now, this isn't a perfect phone of course.Here are a few flaws:1) No microSD slot: This is a problem for some people, since 16GB is not enough if you take a lot of pictures, or if you listen to A LOT of music. The HTC One on the other hand, even though it doesn't come with a microSD slot, it comes with either 32 or 64 GB of internal memory, instead of 8 and 16 (which is the case for the Nexus 4). And I think that for a cell phone, even 32GB is more than enough.2) no LTE/4G: Guys, we don't even have 4G in my country. We do have 3.5G, or H+, which is what you see on your phone. And since that's my personal case, this doesn't bother me at all. Also, I've heard that even in the US there's still no 4G coverage everywhere you go, so... it relaly depends on our location.3) Photos are blurry when the place is dark, and you take pics with the flash: This happened to me at least 3 out of 4 times. It bothered me a little bit, but.... meh. It depends on what you're looking for. You bought a camera or a cell phone? Besides... in daylight, the camara performs well enough in my opinion.Except for the third one, you already knew about the first two, so that shouldn't bother you if you bought, or are thinking about buying the phone, just because you already know/knew what to expect.However, as I said before: I wish you the best trying to look for a phone as fast as the Nexus 4, with the same specs, for the same price or better. At the time of me writing this review, there just isn't any!So yeah, there you have it. Go and freakin buy this phone. At least for the next year or two, you're going to be the first one receiving the latest updates to the Android OS. And if Google keeps it the way it has been so far, the phone can only get faster. And I'm happy with that.Would I recommend it? Heck yes I would.                    Very good! So nice phone;Before it, I wanted buy iphone. But iPhone so expensive and I already have ipad, so...                    I'm a committed Google product user.  I've been using Google for 13 years and would never consider a different brand if Google has the product.  However, I live in an area with no cell reception so this is the first time I ever used any smartphone.  This puts me in a unique position to list the bugs which make the Google Nexus 4 so hard to learn.  I need a place to keep a running list of bugs as I encounter them.1.  The entry of user name and password is so difficult that I've given up trying to do it without a Blue Tooth keyboard, and even then it takes several attempts.  The following are the bugs only associated with this problem.  1a:  The "Show Password" check box is on a different screen than the password entry screen.  By the time you get the wrong username/password message, you can't go back and look at what you entered.  1b:  When you set "Show Password" it often lapses back into the no show mode.  1c:  The on screen keyboard is too small for people with big fingers, and there's room on the password entry screen to solve this problem for the limited case of user name/password entry.  1d.  The username/password characters that you type are often forgotten before you can complete entry.  1e.  The phone does not include a stylus which is needed to get started. I have not yet found any household material that will do as a stylus.  I ordered a stylus from Amazon, and neither end of the stylus would work on this phone.  1f.  There is no undo.  While you can't undo a call, for example, there is a need for an undo when entering username/password.  1g.  There are error modes when your finger lands slightly off target or on 2 keys, where the whole screen changes, and you can't get back, and by the time you do, what you typed is gone.2.  The battery screen gives %, and "time on battery" but does not say if these refer to power and time USED or LEFT (remaining), or perhaps the charging efficiency.  Between the battery, the charger, the cable, your power outlet, the message system, wireless or wired charger, and if you are using a case, there are many variables and you need to know what Google is attempting to display.  2a.  This bug is compounded by the fact that the % does not always update when you select REFRESH.  2b.  This bug is compounded by the lack of little blue '?' symbols that let you know what these numbers are measuring. I'm still trying to figure out if my wireless charger works the same through a case, and knowing what the numbers mean may help.3.  Camera.  The camera will take Spherical Pictures and upload them to Google+, and allow viewers to explore the photo  like an ant walking on the inside of a photo sphere.  This type of photo is commonly seen on realestate sites; but now its on the phone and easy.  However, I'm finding bugs.  3a.  It is not obvious how to exit camera mode.  There's a secret spot on the screen that has no label or icon that you have to touch to get out of camera mode.  Each little gotcha like this requires a Google search to learn what should be obvious.  3b.  I love my spherical pictures, especially when I can use INSTANT UPLOAD and view them on my PC monitor.  Only problem is that sometimes Instant Upload works, and sometimes it doesn't.  This is no doubt due to the fact that you have to turn on instant upload in some menu that is so buried that once you find it, its hard to get lucky twice.  The Instant Upload command should be located on the camera screen as well is buried deep within the menu structure.  There also may be other things that must be set ?  3c.  There is a screen with 8 different things to set to get camera uploads to Google+.  With some settings, there has to be a check mark next to the selected alternative.  With some, setting an option changes the text to say what option you selected.  For one there is a barely visible check box that selects the option.  This is hopelessly confusing, and I still only get some of my instant uploads.I will be adding and subtracting this list as I climb Google's first product with a steep learning curve.All this being said, I would never consider getting a different phone and there are many innovations including important innovations in photography.  The phone would be well worth the money to me even if I only used the camera.  So I give it 6 stars for innovation and important new inventions, but one star for having too many bugs.                    16gb cost 387$ on google, but you must use proxy to ghet in store and a bunch of stuff, it was a waste of time for me, google takes too much for an order update or cancel, also there is no support unlike amazon, so i bought it on amazon, 60$ morethe phone is great, you just can't beat the price, off course it's not perfectthe bad:*the screenis 4.7, but part of that space is wasted for buttons, so in the end it is like 4.4", too bad, but the screen is awesome*space,16gb has 12.9gb free, yes 12.9, i repeat 12.9, that sucks, should have been 15gb at least,  there is no microsd, well i really don't care much, i just put little music and vids and basic gamesyou will have problems if you put like 5 monster games like real racing 3, aspahlt 7, gta3,  etc, they are 1gb each, but regular 2d games are 50mb, just play few games, there is no need to have 40 hd games, also you don't need 5gb of music or videos, get an ipod, and watch vids on pc, just use the space for pics, vids and apps games*sound designthe speaker is below the phone, so having the phone lay down, will have little volume, it sucks, should have been on a side*design glassthe phone look great, but it feels too fragile, should break with just one fall, so buy a protector or be very carefull, but i am sure i will drop mine sometime*usb transfersa little slow for my taste, too slow actually*google play storefree apps just suck, they are full of ads, yes, agmes like angry birds, cut the rope, etc, have ands in game and even send you ads when you are not playing, get apps from elsewhere*heatphone gets very warm while playing heavy games, really hot*3d gamesi don't know who to blame, but 3d games sucks a little on the nexus 4, gta vice city has a lot of lag, real racing 3 a little, modern combat 4 some, and lots more, i mean, i don't really know if all androids have the same issue, maybe games are not optimized, maybe the phone is not good for games, maybe cpu heat gets thermal throttle and slow downs everything, but i expected better performance being a pc gamer i want my games at 60fps, and this phone should do it easily with 4 cores next gen s4 pro2d games have no problems, and many light 3d games, the problems are advanced 3d games (not all thank god)*camerait sucks, really, no way to avoid it, it is lame, it works perfect but quality is lame, does close ups, panoramas, 360 panoramas great, but quality of everything is crap---------the good greatphone OS, speed, power*the phone is ultra fast for everything, GUI is smooth even doing several stuff, amazing, i just love it, 60fps for everything*android 4.2.2, is so great, so easy to use, this was my 1th time, coming from symbian, takes a little time but now i am an expert, android is just easy to use, this is a really smart phone, love integration of apps*ram, cputhis thing has 2gb of ram, so you will never have to worry about open apps, background services, etc, off course background apps will eat battery and a little of cpu, some apps are just crap, others work fine like wassap, gmail, facebook, etc, very good notificationsall apps are very smooth and work perfect, and so many games, but 3d games don't work so nice*samsung galaxy is dropping prices, but it is 1gb of ram and quadcores of older gen                    This by far the best android phone on the market. Here is a small list reasons this phone is great.1) Perfect size. Not to big or to small2) First to get newest updates.3) Takes great pics and videos4) Crazy fast crazy fast. This should of been first.5) Plays almost any of not ever game in the market.6) Did I mention that it is crazy fast7) Great battery life. I've gotten 16 hours on one charge and average 10 to 12 hours daily.If that does not sell you then I don't know what will.                    excelente equipo sin quejas, jamas volvere a usar blackberry es bastante rapido como esperaba y y llego a tiempo. altamente recomendado                    After alot of research and thinking I choose the Nexus 4 and I did the right choice.Greate Display, Very Fast,Good Price, Good Hearing, Greate size.all around greate smartphone.                    I carried a Nexus 1 every day for years with no appreciable damage.  To this day, it has no scratches or cracks.I recently upgraded to a Nexus 4. In two weeks, with no drops, and with very careful handling, the back of the case has developed a large crack, and the screen has picked up a scratch.  I find this fragility extremely disappointing.  If it cracks from being carried in a front pocket, by itself, I don't imagine it can survive for long with normal handling.  Battery life is also marginal, I feel like I can't actually use the phone for much of anything if I'm to get through a normal day on one charge.Otherwise, the phone's pretty nice.  It has a great screen and a decent user interface, and I like using it.  If you decide to get one, be prepared to charge it often and handle it exceedingly carefully. Good luck.                    Bought this phone from the Google Play website.I use this phone with AT&T and absolutely love it.  It does circles about both my old iPhone 3Gs and my last phone, the Samsung Infuse 4G.  I've yet to find anything wrong or sketchy about this phone.My only problem is that here on Amazon, the price is BADLY inflated.  Do NOT buy from here.  Go to Google Play and pay the REAL price for the phone.                    I am an Android/iPhone programmer and thus go through many devices for development/testing; Over the years, I have flipped back and forth between the iPhone and Android and it's once again time to flip back to the Android camp for my personal phone with the Google Nexus 4. If the iPhone 5 was as thin and as light as the iPod Touch 5, I would have switched back to iPhone as my personal device, though it's still very much my media consumption device (tv shows, music, etc.).pros---Just right screen size (4.7") with 1280x768 HD resolution for better email, web and FB experience; Everything on the phone is much snappier/faster; Premium quality finish and feel in hand; Incredible 360 panorama photo mode; Unlocked World phone;cons---Still does not compare to Apple's device/iTunes ecosystem for buying/consuming media;
!###Super fast phone, getting always first any android update, this beautifully made.Pros:Fast.Lovely big screen.Cheap for the specs.Fastest android updates.Good Camera.Cons:No sd slot.                    When I purchased this phone I knew that it won't be available in my country any time soon specially that it's sold out from Google Play. Z-Deals are ripping off with their prices (615$) but unfortunately there is no alternative. So I bought it from them.Regarding the phone Jelly Bean 4.2.1 is just awesome. LG did a great job with this nexus you can use it for gaming or whatever high processing matter it just won't get slow.Only downside is the quality of the camera in night shots.                    ETA  Update August 18, 2013 (used phone for three months in India)I've lowered the rating from 4 to 3.  I am one of the lucky ones I haven't dropped the phone, nor has it slid off of counter, so it is in the same shape as purchased.  I use a bumper at all times.  I tried the case flip cover thing, but it annoyed me too much to continue with it.I still find the ease of seeing all of my accounts.  Once I realized how to use the three different methods of finding a phone number to call and how one of them can be used similar to a speed dialing, I became less agitated as I didn't have to go through so many screens to make a simple phone call.Compared to my son's Samsung Galaxy I find the photo quality lacking.  The camera itself is fairly easy to use but I have seen better.My main issue is sound.  It is so limited.  I realize the speakers are on the back but this wouldn't have to be a big deal if I could put the volume up.  Even while talking the other person's voice is often very faint.In addition, even being in an urban setting my phone is often unable to catch a signal.  I could blame my carrier, but I will be sitting next to someone with the same carrier and they have 5 bars while mine sits on 2 or even none.The worst is the number of times I have pocket dialed someone. Unless I insure the screen is locked or the phone screen is on the number pad screen any stray movement can cause the phone to dial out.  I have made several accidental calls just when trying to hang up the phone.  Once the red is gone if my finger is anywhere on the screen I call someone.  One of these days it is going to cause me great embarrassment.I wish I had known the HTC version was coming out when I purchased this.  I would have waited and compared.  As it is, my friend is very happy with his HTC Google phone.I will continue to use the LG Google phone, but I don't think I will keep it the five years as I have done on my other phone.  The first real excuse I can find and it is gone.ORIGINAL REVIEW ORIGINAL REVIEW ORIGINAL REVIEW ORIGINAL REVIEW ORIGINAL REVIEW ORIGINAL REVIEWI am not a techno geek, just someone who likes to use all of the bells and whistles.  I am not one to upgrade for the sake of having the latest and greatest, I had my blackberry for at least three years and would probably be still using it if I hadn't dropped it for the umpteenth time.When I realized my phone was dying about two months ago I started the process of researching.  In my house we have the iPhone5, the Samsung Galaxy3, Nokias, Blackberrys, and have owned many others.  As I live in India I had shortlisted down to iPhone5 and the Samsung as these were readily available.  I was leaning towards the Samsung when I asked my nephews opinion.  He told me forget everything else and just get the Nexus.  After more research that is what I did.The first order of business was that my old, very old sim was too big for Nexus.  It was even too big to be cut down and so I had to go to Airtel which for Rs 25 gave me a new micro sim within 5 minutes and even installed it for me.  I wish everything else had been so easy.When I first turned on the phone, I was walked through many of the usual set ups.  The major problem came when the first time the phone rang.  As I had never used a phone touch screen before, I didn't realize that I just needed to swipe my finger from left to right over the little circle.  I missed a lot of calls before I went to the forums and found out that I wasn't the only one wishing there was a how-to booklet in the box.I have now been using the phone for over two weeks.  I have learned to answer the phone and learned how to find all the messages by pulling down the front screen. I've learned that there are some exciting things such as the maps that can navigate even in Haryana. I have all of my email account and social networking apps installed.  I can surf, and search. I have learned to appreciate the cards that pop up with timely information.I have learned to swipe write, still have mistakes but it has made writing texts so much easier to swipe from letter to letter like cursive texting than to try and hit teeny tiny buttons with my big fingers.I was first taken aback when a Picasa album that I had made years ago and forgotten about appeared in my gallery.  This is when I truly realized the power of having a Google phone.  I am still discovering, but I look at it as an adventure.There are some things I'm still not happy with.  The lack of any documentation is deplorable.  I realize that many already understand the concepts, but some of us newbies and converts would like to know what all the bells and whistles are without having to resort to the forums.  I thought I had loaded my music onto my phone, but somehow I am unable to access any of it. When I have time I will research what I am doing wrong.I thought I would be able to convert all of my contacts from Outlook to the phone.  That doesn't happen.  I put all of my blackberry contacts into my Google Account and then synched.  There may be an easier way, but I couldn't find it on the forums.There is no mute button.  I realize that is a small thing, but when you have forgotten to turn the volume all the way down and you get a call at the most inopportune time, it is an issue.So while I haven't learned all the bells and whistles, I am looking forward to the adventure of finding them.If you only use your phone for calls, texts and perhaps an email account, I would recommend that you find a more basic phone. If you can't take the time to learn and research don't get this.  While many of the things are intuitive, I know I am missing out on some fun things.However, if you have the fortitude and the desire to have a phone that can really be that personal attendant and not just a telephone.  Then this is the way to go.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE.ETA:  Have discovered that my wma files cannot be used on an android.  I now have to convert my music to a usable format.  Good thing vacation is coming up.                    Android Philosophy -->----------------------The phones now are really choosing eco-system hence choosing the philosophy that suits you the best or inline with your personality or thought process. Apple (iOS) as everybody knows is a closed, restricted. iOS is certainly a 'weaker' OS, while Android lets you wander freely in the open sky and its more powerful. You will never feel restricted when you want to do anything with it. YOU FEEL YOU TOTALLY CONTROL YOUR DEVICE. That's where I like Android more over iOS. Android does not treat you dumb, it treats you intelligent, responsible and let you control your device and hence its overall usage.I just don't understand how one fruit company can control your device so much whereas on the other hand people even control their own life. More confusing is how people can let a company do that. Just because it produces the best looking product? IF THAT'S THE CASE WHY NOT BUY SOME ART WORK? AT LEAST WE WILL HELP ONE ARTIST. The device is for show-off or your own experience? What is more useful? A trophy wife or a mom like wife which does not look best but keep growing on you each day? Keeping the OS such dumb is for probably making the UI simple. Well use Android (pure stock Android that comes with google devices and you will never go back to iOS and rather you will find iOS lesser user and CUSTOMER friendly.Now little into specs->-----------------------1. Absence of LTE (The so called biggest flaw) -> Well the most sold iPhone 4S was same just 6 months ago and apple fan boy were not complaining at all and they would not had iPhone does not have LTE. Absence of LTE saves battery drain, data usage and HSPA is good enough for what smart phones are intended for and looking at smart phone usage pattern [MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE].2. Camera is not great but good enough.AND REST EVERYTHING IS JUST GREAT-> Super fast, snappy, Screen (as good as retina), call quality, battery life, built quality, looks (great), ease of use. After nexus 3 and nexus 7 this device offers you the best value for your money. You are free to switch carrier or at least deny contract and hence control on your device by the carriers. GOOGLE DEVICES ARE ALWAYS FIRST GET UPDATE. My wife is having S2 and she is still waiting for 4.2 even after 6 months of 4.2 coming.----------------------------------------------------------------------Two Real life Examples iPhone lovers who converted into nexus 4 users----------------------------------------------------------------------1. My friend who was using latest iOS on iPhone 4S just said: AFTER USING NEXUS 4 iPhone FELT LIKE TOY. Now there is no going back for him.2. Another prime example (probably one of the biggest iOS (apple) lover Ralf Rottmann. He is co-founder of biggest iOS (Apple) app developing company of GERMANY and has the latest Apple TVs, two iMacs, the latest MacBook Air, a MacBook Pro, more than five AirPort Express stations and Apple's Time Capsule and yes iPhone 5 as well.HE HAS NOW TOTALLY CONVERTED INTO NEXUS 4. Read this great article (gizmodo.com/5973073/an-iphone-lovers-confession-i-switched-to-the-nexus-4-completely).-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bottom line-> Need phone now or need unlocked phone? Go for nexus 4. Can wait? wait for next nexus phone.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    I will never ever buy a cellphone without android stock. much faster without bugs.... I change my S3 for this nexus 4                    great phone and high-end power with its attractive android 4.3 system the most powerful so far is undoubtedly the most powerful phone to run any game                    Excelent product, cames in good condition and complete new. I recomend it 100%, android is my favorite cel phone, this is really fast and easy to used.                    I bought through the Play store about 5 months ago. Today, it developed a crack on the back. No problem I thought, I'll call customer service, they'll help. After a while on the phone, they try to send me off to LG, who, they claim, take care of the warranty on the physical phone. Alright, so the LG guy tells me, nope, no warranty, but I can send it in for repairs. I go back to Google and explain what the LG guy says. They claim, the cosmetics are not covered. Yes, glass is cosmetic on a touch screen phone. Sure. Anyway, the moral of the story is, Google does not stand behind these devices. They have a paltry warranty and no customer service to speak of. I also have a Nexus 7 and was planning to get a Nexus 10, but I am reconsidering. Other than being fragile and having terrible service, the phone is pretty good. Very fast, very capable. A little too big if you ask me, but manageable.                    Gave my 24 year old son who is in final year Med School and a phone freak, this phone as a birthday gift !He is extremely pleased and loves all of its exceptional features.                    I bought the 16G phone directly from the Google Play store for $349. Shipping was another $12. It was received in 4 business days (ordered Wednesday afternoon and delivered Monday morning). Can't complain about that. Buying straight from Google will also make any future issues easier to deal with than going through a third party.The phone is everything it is hyped to be. I couldn't be more pleased with it.I am running it on Straight Talk with an ATT micro sim card. Straight Talk now only offers the T-Mobile micro sim card, but you can still get the ATT version on here and on eBay. I went with ATT because the T-Mobile coverage in my area isn't that great. The cards are in short supply, so the prices are going up. I bought mine a few weeks ago for $45. The same cards are now going to close to $70. The T-Mobile cards from Straight Talk are only $15, so if you live where there is good T-Mobile coverage, that is the way to go.In my case, it was about $410 total for the 16G phone, the shipping, and the sim card. Would have been $380 with the T-Mobile card.  Now for $45/month I have unlimited talk, text, and data on ATT through Straight Talk. I am a happy camper.
!###I have used an iPhone since 2008, but when the iPhone 5 came out, I was unimpressed and began looking elsewhere, mostly I was looking for a bigger screen. Now I say that as a man with fairly large hands. For someone with smaller hands, the iPhone might work better, my sister and girlfriend both think this phone is too big, so I throw that in as a caveat. But for me...What makes the Nexus 4 great are two things 1) the price and build quality of the phone and 2) the PURE Android experience.  Honestly, (keep in mind I own an iMac, a Macbook Air and an iPad Mini) the learning curve was SUPER low and once I got the hang of it, I actually found it easier to use than my iPhone.  The other thing is the Google integration and given my work related calendar and email revolve around google - this phone was actually more seamless than my iPhone because it integrates your info automatically.  That said, it was a bit freaky when my old GF's numbers came up in contacts that I long thought I had deleted, so Google and privacy/deletion are what they are, but as far as work integration I like it.Now the physicality/hardware of the phone is pretty simple design wise, but it does not feel cheap.  I really liked the Samsung Galaxy III and ESPECIALLY the Note 2, but as much as I loved the screen real estate they felt a little cheap and plastic-y in my hand.  Now I realize the Google glass might be an issue for some who might drop their phones or let their kids play with them (I know moms and dads sometimes you'd rather keep them quiet even though they may drop it! haha) but for me I don't see it as an issue as long as you get a protective case.  The Nexus 4 feels just right in my hand and it grips really well.  The screen is FANTASTIC, now quite Droid DNA'ish (thats the best I've seen on a phone) BUT it's close and for the price difference and lack of 2 yr contract - for me - totally worth it.  On the negative side, that pretty and large screen, if the brightness is turned up DOES suck battery pretty quickly.On the software end, the pure Android Google experience in my opinion exceeds Apple's latest iterations of iOS.  It just does. It's easy to use and smooth and the ability to use widgets for my calendar and email is great.  I also really LOVE and this deserves to be on it's own line so:GOOGLE PLAY!!!!This takes iTunes to the level that it should be.  You can load up to 20,000 songs on Google Play from your iTunes and have them available for streaming (Spotify style) one your phone ANYWHERE you go.  It is simply the BEST music experience on any device I have ever had.  You don't have to load your phone's memory down with too much music, nor do you have to buy a more expensive model with more storage because ALL YOUR music is available at any time.  I really appreciate this because as a premium Spotify user some artist (the Beatles, Led Zep, Pink Floyd, Radiohead etc) are NOT available on Spotify.  In fact I would personally cancel my Spotify but my GF loves it so she uses it on her iPhone.One last thing, I use this phone on a month to month contract with Straight Talk with an AT-T SIM card and it works almost as well as my Verizon service and I live in a remote mountainous area, so I would recommend that service as well.Anyhow, more later, but so far I don't anticipate using another phone for a VERY long time.  Thanks for reading, hope this helped. PEACE!                    Came as described: Used Like New. I doesn't show any wear off, and is working perfectly, now supporting KitKat.Great phone, the only con is the battery life.                    Amazing phone. I love it. Nothing much required to talk about this .....One of the best product from Google Android.                    This seems to be an excellent smart phone, priced better than Apple ones with comparable features and even updated itself to the latest android OS jellybean soon after being activated. It has been used already in the USA and Asia in just a few weeks working out very well over the t-mobile/softbank network.  The transaction on Amazon went well too with the seller.                    Works great!!!! Good, nice and cheap. It's a product that you feel proud, i got this phone 6 months and never had a freeze moment.                    Best bang for the buck when coming to Android phones... you simply can't get a better deal than a Nexus... the only downside is that the screen is worse than Samsung's and HTC (but that's to be expected given the price difference)                    Arrived ok on time... But after 4.3 update the cell phone lost signal only workd on 2G... search on google 4.3 buGs... also a little dissapointed on the camera... fast cell phone speed... and internet while worked... Seller was Good and fast                    Excelent. It was what we expected.I will reccomend it for sure to everybody to do the same we have done                    It is still the best smartphone for almost everyone who wants to buy good android phone but do not need a good camera (camera is awful); battery life is actually comparable to iPhone 4S and 5;                    Love my phone! I researched a lot of phones before I chose this one.  It does everything my HTC Inspire didn't or wouldn't do and then some!  Of course, I think part of the problem was my carrier too. I have been using this phone for almost 6 months and there have been very few issues.  Because it is all glass, I was a little paranoid about breaking it, but I have cured most of that with the cases I have purchased.  The only real gripe I have is when my phone recently updated to 4.4, it kicked off the clock widget I was using on my home page.  The widgetwas downloaded again, but when I try to use it, it will not open.  Bummer.  Oh well, a small price to pay for such a great phone.  The only other thing is that I wish it had an SD card slot in order to expand storage. Again, not rally that big a deal because I knew that when I purchased the phone.  I know the Nexus 5 is out now, but I think I will just stick with my 4 for now.  Haven't seen enough of the 5 to warrant a change.
!###Fantastic phone, incredible screen, slim, fast, sexy... Did I mention the screen?Upgraded to Android 4.4 right on first power on.Awesome.                    HD display, 4.7 screen sizequad core processor2 GByte RAMAndroid, always last versionfastin summary,excellent product , good price                    The Nexus 4 was breaking the rules from the day it came out.  On it's way out the door, it did it one last time with a firesale seen 'round the world.This is far from a perfect phone. I'd love an SD slot and fully implemented USB OTG. Higher quality buttons, more local storage and better heat dissipation would be nice too. But it is very high end, with a gorgeous and versatile screen, powerful guts, an impressive amount of RAM and a price tag to die for.Carriers love the smartphone market. They've been abusing it for ages, pushing profit margins for smartphones many times higher than similar electronics markets because people don't pay attention to their total accumulated costs, just the upfront fees. That left prepaid folks with few good options. The Nexus 4 did a ton to change that, and we're seeing great new options from moto and nokia and others now that build on that success.  The smartphone market of the future is going to be a lot better for everyone, and the Nexus 4 did a lot to drive quality forward at reasonable prices.                    I live in Taiwan and this phone was a breeze to get working here.  Does everything a smartphone should without all the bloat.                    i think it's one of the most impresive phones that i ever had. it's quick and easy to use, and is what i want                    I really enjoy my nexus 4. I also have a nexus 7 so I am a big fan of the nexus family. The phone is very durable, sleek and stylish. I have had my phone for about two months and I have loved every minute of it. The apps are fast, google service is amazing, the videos are great, pictures, sounds all are amazing. Google has done a great job with this phone, the best part is it only cost me $270.00!                    This a great phone with fast Snapdragon CPU and enough 2GB RAM to handle the applications. The internal 16GB storage is very good but I still miss the slot for an upgrade SD memory card for people like me that wants to load it with lots of music. The battery life is pretty much standard and would last if you're not a geek using it all the time, otherwise make sure you carry your charger with you or at least the USB cable for contingency. Having a phone which receive updates directly from the OS creator is awesome, no more delays and severe bugs. The change from Samsung to LG was a downside because Samsung hardware is way more robust but let's see if they fix this gap with the launch of Nexus 5.                    it is very good! Great! The phone looks as good as I expected.! I will buy it again next time!                    this phone is amazing. I bought it after my iphone died and I'm not missing it at all. plus, if you're a Google user (who isn't??) you'll find it oh-so-useful. awesome.                    If you dont need micro sd or LTE then this is the best android phone to date. I actually dont need LTE so im keeping this over the nexus 5
!###This phone is just amazing. Its true that the phone has no LTE but lets be honest it does not matter for some people. It is just as fast if not faster than LTE in certain areas. The phone is snappy, with a clean design. It may not have a sd card slot but have you heard of the "cloud" or Google play. I agree that 16gb should be the minimum for new phones but it still holds depending what you do. No replaceable battery but I can live with that as I never actually cared about swapping batteries. The price is amazing compared to other phones and obviously cheap for certain reason. All those things just add a heftier price to the phone. Overall great so far and sleek.                    This is a truly incredible phone. For the money, you CANNOT get a better phone. Comparable phones like the Samsung Galaxy S 3 cost double and are not as good as this great phone. You get it unlocked to use on any carrier that is compatible. There are a few negatives to it, though.PROS:1. 2GB of RAM and a Quad-Core Qualcomm processor make this phone completely smooth and effortless.2. This phone runs the pure, stock Android from Google unlike most phones like the Samsung Galaxy that have interfaces to slow them down and make them ugly.3. You get the newest version of Android straight from Google before anybody else. This is very nice to have and is one of the main reasons I bought it. Your phone has the newest and best software always.4. The Google Play store for downloading apps is incredibly well stocked and has even more apps than the Apple App Store.5. The screen is beautiful and the phone itself is very nice feeling.CONS:1. The battery life is less than stellar, but it does last plenty long for a light day.2. The operating system occasionally has a few problems, like the thing randomly shuts down and things like that, but it is okay.3. The phone is a bit fragile. I use this case:Ballistic SG1098-M005 AGF SG Series Case for LG E960/NEXUS 4 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black and it has protected it very nicely. I have a case just like this one Asmyna ALGE960HPCAST003NP Astronoot Premium Hybrid Case with Durable Hard Plastic Faceplate for LG Nexus 4 E960 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black for my HTC 8X and it is very nice for a low price. I would definetly recommend that case for the everyday drops of your phone.In closing, this is a stellar phone that will not disappoint you. I just highly recommend that you buy a good case for it (it is well worth just five dollars) and you will love it.                    Amazon has to adjust the price for this item.Google Play has the Nexus 4 8GB @ $199 and 16GB @$249.I just ordered from Google Play. Google has reduced the price by $100 as the next Nexus model is going to be released soon.                    This is probably one of the best phone you can get today.Best things first:1) Built quality is very premium2) High def screen3) Amazing Google services4) Best Android experience, NO crapware, NO bloatware5) Updates directly from Google. ( I got Jelly bean 4.3, just 5 days after release)6) Shockingly low price, considering its built quality and it's "Totally UNLOCKED".  DONOT BUY IT FROM AMAZON. ITS WAY CHEAPER IF YOU BUY IT DIRECTLY FROM GOOGLE PLAY STORE.7) Google is giving free Bumper with this phone.Good things next:1) Camera is good, but does not excel the competition2) Battery life is OKNot so good things Last:1)Gorilla glass on the back is too smooth, some times slips from your hand and from most of the surfaces. So, better use bumper that comes free with this.2) No SD Card. But, with 15GB of cloud storage on Google drive and other free cloud storage, this should be Ok.3) No LTE. But, HSDPA+ speeds on T Mobile are pretty impressive.                    This is a comparison of the S3 (I9300 quad core) vs the nexus. This was the last shot I gave to android.I figured that if I did not like the nexus, I would return it and just get an iphone.I'm keeping the nexus. It works perfectly for my needs without lag or crashes. It does not overheat or drop wifi or irritate me with nuisance issues.Read on for a brief comparison of what I can remember now. . .I've used the samsung galaxy tab and the S3 (I9300) for over a year now.I never liked them. Applications were slow and laggy. Both my devices used to reboot every day on their own, often in the middle of something.Sending an email with an attachment would make the email app crash.They were loaded with bloatware. There was no way to turn the animations off either.The list of issues was endless.I was annoyed with the dark spots on the screen (visible while watching youtube at night).Magenta would look like red. There was no way to calibrate the screen to make it look 'normal'. Cyan and Aqua were the same color too.Somehow, I always felt that videos were like watching recolored b/w movies or sometimes even cartoons.The capacitative touch buttons were always getting in my way. Samsung voice was a royal pain.After the jellybean upgrade to 4.2 the S3 was far from butter smooth. It was a pain to launch the phone app, wait 3 seconds for it to load then type a phone number with a half second lag pressing each button.if I held the S3 in my left hand, wifi would drop 2 bars. It rarely connected to free wifi offered at hotels.I could not hold the S3 to my face for more than 5 minutes. It would get really hot at the earpiece area.I bought my Nexus 4 from google directly. I figured I could return it within the 15 day period for a full refund.It's been a month now, I am not returning it.It is super fast and smooth. If there is an android phone which can rival the smoothness of an iphone, it is this.Sure the battery does not last me two days like the S3. It only lasts me one day, but I am always thumbing this phone.All the stock applications work perfectly.The camera is also 8MP, but the picture clarity is so much better.HDR shots need a steady hand, but come out looking beautiful.I've installed many apps from the play store now. Apps like lightflow which never worked on the S3 work almost perfectly on the nexus.Apple was right about one thing. Don't look at the specs of the device alone. Look at the overall package.The nexus 4 has a lower clocked processor than the note 2 or the S3. But everything works perfectly.Bottomline: Google gives out a free os which works almost perfectly on it's own. The stock os is the way android is meant to be.Phone makers spoil the experience by loading their bloatware.The nexus 4 does not have any of the issues of the S3, and I do not miss any of the features which the S3 had (turn around to mute, palm swipe to take a snapshot.. .).                    Just so you guys know how I use this phone, I am currently a contractor in afghanistan and I am currently using a local Sim card in this phone. So I dont have that high speed 4g stuff that most of you will be using with this phone.First off, the phone just feels great. When first turned it on, I had to setup my google account to the phone, which was a pain because I wasn't anywhere near WiFi at the time so I had to wait to set it up. The turns off/ on quickly, much better than my 5 minute boot time on my EVO lol. WiFi on this thing is great, much faster surfing/downloading speeds than my laptop. I have downloaded games and called home with this thing and can say that this thing is AWESOME. I also bought this phone so that when I do go home, I can just pop in a sim card and start using it between the states and afghanistan. This phone also comes unlocked. Its a google phone, so we will be the first ones to receive updates!The list goes on guys...Now, YOU CAN GO TO GOOGLE AND BUY THIS ON THE PLAYSTORE FOR $299 for the 8gb and $350 for the 16gb!!!!!!!!I didn't want to wait so i bought mine for about $400 and STILL do not regret paying that!Great Phone, will recommend a buy rating here!                    I started shopping for an unlocked GSM phone 3 months ago. The Nexus 4 was my top choice. But it was out of stock in the Google Play store, with no ETA in sight for its return. And if you could find one for sale elsewhere, the prices were jacked up. No, thanks.So I compromised, and bought the Samsung Galaxy S III Mini I8190 - which is a fine phone. I posted a favorable review of it and don't take it back. But. The Nexus 4 is more optimized for my carrier (T Mobile) than the Galaxy S Mini (the diff is the 1700 band which T-Mo uses, the Nexus has, and the Mini doesn't). Also, I wasn't happy with the Mini's camera, which I thought was laggy when taking photos.Now, the Nexus 4 is back in stock at Google Play. Last week I surrendered to temptation and bought it from Google Play. No regrets!Pros:*** Camera is really good, much better than the Mini.*** No manufacturer bloatware. I think the built-in digital clock display is ugly, but found an attractive and efficient weather/time widget for the home page - Android Weather - so I don't need to display the ugly digital clock.*** Blazing fast operation, and an elegant interface. For instance, I touched the link to a Word file attached to a Gmail message, expecting to have more steps to open it. Nope - it just popped open on my screen. Instantly. Sweet!*** Using Adobe Reader, fabulously responsive swipe/enlarge function with pdf files.*** I'm getting better connection speeds on the T-Mo network.Cautions:*** My Mini uses a regular sized SIM card, and the Nexus 4 takes a micro SIM. However, the guys at the local T-Mo store were helpful with that.*** No slot for microSD card. This is my first smartphone without that, but so far I've loaded it with my apps and a bunch of Kindle books and still have 11 or 12 GB of available space. Videos would take up a lot of space but I would rarely want to keep those on my phone.*** The battery isn't user-replaceable. So I've bought the Anker® Astro 5600mAh Backup External Battery Pack High Capacity Charger, to carry when I'm going to be away from power outlets for long days, which isn't unusual. I did a test-charge with it at home and it fully charged the phone and had plenty left in reserve. It's also much easier to use than taking off a phone cover and swapping batteries.

Colors look good just more like they are drawn with pastels.Final ThoughtsFor the money there is no better option, even money aside the only other phone that may be slightly better is the GS3. Tmobile has a prepaid $30 a month unlimited Data/Texting plan, and you can use a VOIP service with your data plan to get unlimited talk.If you can drop $350, there certainly is no reason to be on a contract with your carrier anymore.-Side note you will have to pay tax on the $350 even if you order online.------------------------------------------UPDATE 7/30/2013The speaker/mic location on this phone is terrible.-1 speaker on the back of the phone. This meansif you have the original version the sound ismuffled when lying flat.-The more pressing issue is if you hold thislike a right handed person would it is very easyto have your hand cover the singular mic on the phoneand you will not be heard by whoever you are talking to.                    I recently broke my iPhone 5 (ouch!!!) and had to buy another smart phone urgently. So went to Google play store and ordered this beast .... and as expected, it a powerhouse phone with lots of features and lots of frills. I am quite comfortable with iOS and android OS and I know that android lets you to customize your phone in a way you like it (so many gadgets makes this phone very cool). So overall I am happy with my phone.Things I don't like-1. It's a big phone (like Galaxy S3) and I don't understand this new trend of making big phones. I have big hands and I still sometimes need to use two hands to type message or handle the phone. It was quite easy and best selling point for iPhone5 to make it 4 inch phone, just about enough to handle with one hand and your thumb can reach corner to corner easily, unlike N4.2. Touchscreen is not sensitive enough as compare to iPhone5. While scrolling, zooming in and out, you can feel the difference effortlessly.Things that I like:1. Powerhouse phone - the speed of this phone is tremendous, no buffering while opening books or documents, opens and closes the apps in seconds.2. Battery: many people complained about battery issue; however, I think battery is great. I am not heavy user of my phone and I do whatsapp almost all the time. I use att's 3g and home wifi (80/20) and with this internet use my phone lasts for entire day and still have 20% battery left when I go to bed. Battery usage was quite comparable with iPhone5 (but it used LTE which was more power consuming). In a nutshell, I am quite satisfied with battery performance in N43. Stunning look - it looks different and more finished and stylist. There are lots of plastic phones in the market and this is far superior than them.4. Price - $349 for N4 unlocked its like a dream5. Wireless charging - not needed but very convenient feature6. Display - beautiful colors and perfect saturation, videos look awesome.7. Hardware - front and back gorilla glass gives this phone perfect premium product feel in hand. Its not thin as iPhone5 but still thin enough to keep in front pocket.Overall, I love my phone and I would recommend anybody to buy this phone.PS
!###So I just got the Nexus 4 last week and I originally wanted the Samsung Galaxy S3 but I am glad that my boyfriend pushed me for the Nexus because I LOVE THIS PHONE. First, it is lightning fast. It downloads apps very quickly, which I am extremely pleased about. Also, my battery lasts SOOOOOO long. On my old phone, it would be dead by noon. On this phone, it lasts 10 hours plus without being plugged into the charger. And that is with me playing with it and using apps. There are so many great features on this phone too. It does everything. My friend has the S3 so I played with it and compared it to my phone and I like mine better. The Google Now feature is amazing. I can ask it anything and the answer comes right up. The navigation is fast and works great. I highly recommend this device!                    I absolutely love this phone! Got mine in just 4 days from Google and the phone far exceeds my expectations. Battery life is quite good and performing every function is effortless for this phone. I was curious about how fast this thing is so I took a look at how hard the cpus are working. Turns out that most of time 3 of the 4 cpus are just sitting idle. The one that is active is not working very hard at all. Occasionally you'll see it shoot to 1.5Ghz, but most of time the lone core is operating in the 300-400 Mhz range. That should tell you that this phone is not gonna annoyingly hang up no matter what you throw at it. And why anybody would buy anything but a pure Google phone in the first place i'll never know. No worries about the phone company tampering and keeping you from enjoying the full capabilities of your device.                    My first smartphone was a Samsung Galaxy Ace and despite not being a bad phone, it's not the kind of phone for my use. Little space and little internal memory was causing the phone to lose much performance. Besides the battery does not last at all, even with little use.With the Nexus 4 this problem was completely solved! I installed all the programs of the Galaxy Ace, all of the songs and there was no loss of performance, the battery lasts well in that version 4.2.2, the screen is very good, touch is very fast and efficient, the GPS connects very fast and NFC is very handy. Really I am very satisfied and recommend to all who want to acquire this beautiful phone.Portuguese (Brazil)Meu primeiro smartphone foi um Samsung Galaxy Ace e apesar de não ser um telefone ruim, não &eacute; o tipo de telefone para o meu uso. Pouco espaço interno e pouca mem&oacute;ria estavam fazendo o telefone perder muito desempenho. Al&eacute;m da bateria que não dura nada, mesmo com pouco uso.Com o Nexus 4 esses problemas foram completamente resolvidos! Eu instalei todos os programas do Ace Galaxy, todas as m&uacute;sicas e não houve perda de desempenho, a bateria dura muito bem nessa versão 4.2.2, a tela &eacute; muito boa, o toque &eacute; muito r&aacute;pido e eficiente e sens&iacute;vel , o GPS se conecta muito r&aacute;pido e NFC &eacute; muito &uacute;til. Realmente estou muito satisfeito e recomendo a todos que querem adquirir este excelente e belo telefone.                    I like the new Nexus 4 a lot. As many have already mentioned, the device is very fast and responsive. It has features some of the much more expensive cell phones don't. It is still too early to generalise but so far it's perfect!                    I bought this new Nexus 4 for my wife and she likes it a lot. Before she used the Samsung Galaxy S and now this new one. No way back.The only disadvantage I have seen so far: the Nexus links with the Mercedes-Benz Bluetooth B Class (model 2010) but she cannot use it, no voice coming in and no voice going out. This is very bad. Google and Mercedes you need to do something.If bluetooth will be working on the new B Class you will get 5 stars.                    Really nice smartphone. Just like inumerous web reviews have said, the phone is beatiful, smooth and fast. Better than the pricier Galaxy SIII, imho.                    The Nexus 4 is a super fast phone! It can easily multi-task all the heavy duty apps I run. Plus it gives me peace of mind to know that the quad core processor in this phone will keep it relevant for years to come unlike the Galaxy S3.                    Excelente equipo.. S&uacute;per r&aacute;pido en todas sus funciones.. Dise&ntilde;o muy bonito y llamativo. Viene con Android 4.2 actualizable a 4.2.2. Lo malo: El precio cuando lo compr&eacute; (581$$) era un poco elevado. Despu&eacute;s de una semana bajo casi 100$$ :/                    I only have to say, this phone is a great phone! Personally for me is the best in the market today. Good battery performance, beautiful screen colors, it's very light, easy to use (thanks android) and (since I'm not a programer) this hardware is like a rolls royce! No complains but the price, it's a little high.                    Best phone on the market as of now. Heard DNA is better, but this phone is the best all around device with the perfect price. Gorgeous screen. I am a bit disappointed that it doesn't come in a 32gb version though. Also, must buy a case, it is a bit fragile. Battery life is mediocre, though.
!###I just bought the Nexus 4 not too long ago, when it dropped it price. It was a very compelling to purchase. Figured, made in Korea, very good hardware for the money, stock android, which I like. The most desirable feature is Nexus is the first in line to get new android version, albeit sometimes buggy. Starting with the Nexus 5 however, everything changed. No longer the older Nexuses going to get new features. I just flashed the stock factory image and see how nothing really changes from the outside. All the new features on 4.4 remains exclusive for the Nexus 5 for now (very Apple-like now, as whenever Apple release a new iphone, all new features are on the new iphone, and older iphones receive the update but wont' get every features). This case, I don't think hardware is a problem as the Nexus 5 is very much nothing evolutionary to the Nexus 4. So what does this mean? Nexus line is no longer the best in android. Price is good, but there are always compromises to be made, such as no expansion in storage, camera is underwhelming relatively to the competitions. This is very sad as in the past, Nexus suppose to the first one to get everything push out by Google. Now there is that 18-months window too. This made Nexus line on par with other brand, even though other companies are so slow to push out updates. So, Nexus line is no longer the products as they were the past several years. From the looks of it, Google won't change how thing operate now, which is very disappointing, consider how thing were in the past several years. So now, beside the no expansion storage, Nexus line now has more compromises to be made. The biggest is you will receive updates but not every new features, and now, there is a window for when the updates will stop coming. I know, you can find ROM and whatnots from online but it's the changed in fundamental with the Nexus line that is disappointing. So go buy the Nexus 5 and avoid the Nexus 4, but similar to iphone now, buying the Nexus 5 knowing that coming next year, your phone will missing out new features and want to buy new phones because of that.                    Great phone!. I'm using it in Latinamerica, awsesome performance, beautiful interface. A great purchase. Hope it could be found in the market in spite of has been discontinued.                    Love it and the timing was sweet since the Nexus 5 is now out so the price for the Nexus 4 was SA-WEET!                    Works great, has a spectacular super-sharp screen. This phone is great, I have all the applications you need in one device. Above the price is very good.                    Phone was purchased thru Google Play and not an international version. The phone went dead after almost 6 months, it wouldn't power on even fully charged (charged overnight). Tried everything but still couldn't get it to turn on. Took it to phone tech and he finally was able to get it to power on, however, all data were gone! The tech stated the electronics board was defective and the problem will most likely  reoccur. Since the phone was open and worked on, warranty was voided. Maybe it just my bad luck but, should stayed with Samsung, never had any problems with them for years.                    easy to use ,looks good,good price,not heavy,battary is fine,good flashe,good camera,support a lot of languiges,show all the things that i need                    What good is even the best phone if it is prone to breakage from even the gentlest use? It's a good phone at a good price until a cracked screen renders it useless. Google will not stand behind it though they are fully aware of its vulnerability.                    nice phone.The price is more expensive than google sell.I had iphone 4 i've installed ios7 it was to slow so decide to change to this good phone                    After six months, the phone has just started to turn off.  No reason.  It is so frustrating, and the camera is very poor quality. We realized we had paid way too much on amazon.  Usually very happy with every purchase on Amazon, but not this time.                    I've had this phone for 6 months now of regular usage, and I couldn't be happier. The new Nexus 5 seems nice, but I see no reason to upgrade from the N4 at this point.
!###Great speed, easy to use, flexible and very well documented handboock. I just unpacked it installed the micro simcard and it was ready to fly talking browsing and so on                    too hot and hard to move file from cellphone to desktop.but in terms of price, it's ok.bought this one for gf, she said it's ok                    You cant go wrong with this phone, its a great phone for good price.The câmera is no so good but I already know it.                    This is the third Nexus I have owned and I have to say it is a complete smartphone with extra compared to what is out there, and for the price it cannot be beat.  One only suggestion is for LG to place the phone jack on the bottom next to the power jack like the Samsung.                    The phone is great and looks awesome. It is also blazing fast and reliable. Battery life is ok, I can get through all day without recharging, with 3g sync all the time. Beware that gaming specially 3d games like Real Racing 3 will suck out battery. The glass back looks great, but also makes you being concerned about scratches and falls all the time.                    This product is great. It is everything I could ever expected. It's fast and easy to use. I love it.                    Really like the phone, it's nice to have a fast smartphone and love the pure Android, not only does it just work it works smart and fast! It's so easy to use and have so many great fetures, so many oppotinities with this phone!!Recomend the phone.Had no problems with seller.My thanks here from Denmark! Have a great day!                    I bought this for my son, and He loved it!It is a very good phone.. lots of interesting features                    The cost and the funtionality are great, Google Android at his best in the Nexus 4, really good phone. Recomended                    A superb phone at an affordable price , great specs and good performance .... and that too from google makes it special
!###Awesome phone, mega fast and very good software/hardware, can't wait to have Nexus 5 now. Its a very good phone                    Compared to the Samsung Android's I've had, this phone is amazing. The batter life is ample, the feel is great, the look is nice, and the price from Google is amazing. I'm looking forward to the Nexus 5 for LTE support, otherwise I wouldn't be wanting to upgrade.                    I love this phone. I have had many other android phones, but this one is quick and has an easy UI.Features that this has that an iPhone does not:-Google Now (which is an awesome application)-Multi-language voice control-There may be other I cannot think of                    I bought this phone from Google in February of 2013 and everything else is working fine except two things; Recently sometimes the phone shutdown by itself when using Skype. Secondly, since August 2013 I have had problem adjusting the volume - this means from time to time the volume won't go up and down while pressing the volume key - this means when the key won't work, I have to shut it down to put the volume back to work and it's annoying.  The hardware portion seems working find and as soon as the key volume is pressed, the screen image shows the volume going up and down to certain level(wouldn't go all the way down :/), but no action as far as hearing the volume, therefore, in this case my only option is to turn the phone off then back on. This is what I have to go though everyday to be able to adjust the volume; I do this step 3 to 5 times a day.The funny part is; I'm having the same problem on the third device that I have replaced since there is one year warranty? Google keeps sending me a "new phone" but all phones have volume issues!!! I was wondering if it's the last android updates that is causing the volume key to fail? Thank you.                    It is awesome w reasonable price and function of a good smart phone. I love this fone a lot, recommend it.                    Everything worked perfectly... The only bad thing is that it took a couple of extra days to get here. Not bar at all!                    trust me, you'll want to get this phone while you still can. the nexus 5 comes out soon, (ive already purchased the case for it, even though the phone isnt out yet...) and once its out, this baby is gone for good.  stock up while you can.                    I liked nexus 4 for various reasons and I'm so glad that I got it here. The price was reasonable and the phone worked pretty well so far. Thank you!                    Amazing price, good delivery on time. Phone is amazing : No defects, no problems. Everything is fine. Already using it and have no problem.Only thing you will need is to get shock absorption bumper or case because Nexus 4 is fragile because of its gorilla glass, but this is the main thing that makes it sexy.Phone is amazingly fast and stands next to the top-end today's phones. Performance is great, camera is normal, but for 300$ you pay camera is effin amazing.I just love this phone.                    Likes: Great cellphone, last updated software (Android 4.3), high speed response, big screen, easy to work, good size, economic compared with the rest same level smartphones.Dislikes: Just one analogic button for a lot of functions: The same to power on, power off, wake up, wake down. I hope it resist the continuous push for a long time.
!###worth, an excellent product quality / priceIt is a very good quality product, just what I expected, I recommend it, and fit on the phone.a greeting Ulisesmmf                    I totally recommend the Nexus 4 - it has everything as every other great android in the market - the BIG difference is the PRICE!anything you don't have on the phone - you find in the market5 outta 5                    the question that will hunt you for the rest of eternity after using this phone is that why isn't the stock android deployed for all android phones instead of these disastrous skins from Samsung , htc and others .the nexus is the best android phone you can buy . simple.                    Perfect relation between price and quality.Exccellent mobile phone, excellent softward and hardware. Good quality of components. I don't need any more.                    I personally chose this phone because it runs stock Android 4.2 with no modificarions, and is probably one of the first in line to receive future upgrades from Google.If staying up-to-date software-wise is a priority, I highly recommend this device.Regarding the devices' hardware, it is without doubt the best smart phone I've ever owned. The build quality is what I expect from a device as this one. The UI is fast and responsive most of the time, without significant lags.If you've decided to buy a nexus 4, the 16GB version is a must in my opinion. The phone's media capabilities are underused if the device can't hold many videos/songs.                    Really good product. Nice and sleek. Good performance, life battery and Android capable (with the last version included on the device)                    I choose it because the price worth t. Its an amazing celphone tha i would recommend to everyone who is looking for a nice expereience with Android.                    I based my purchase mostly on this very detailed review[...]of which only some features I can attest, like the battery life (typically lasts a day or so) and the good integration between hardware and OS. At some point I had eight internet tabs open, was playing a game and got called by someone; the system did not even flinch.I've had it for about three months now and what I can add is that I had a problem with the proximity sensor: it is used to deactivate the screen when you are calling someone, so that you don't click on things with your ear. A couple of times, though, the screen did not reactivate after I've pulled it away from my face, and I had to press the power button to stop the call.This still is a minor detail and doesn't change my overall impression of the phone. Great and ununderstandably cheap.                    So I went from iPhone to Nexus, I had my iPhone stolen so I decided to get a cheaper phone, the awesome thing was that NEXUS is cheaper and it is pretty cool. It works super nicely and seriously between and iPhone 4S and a Nexus I will always choose this one. It's a bit hard to adapt to the new ecosystem but that's a fight between Android and iOS.                    I have been using this phone for almost 2 weeks now and the experience has been amazing.Phone design is classy, clean and back panel catches eyes too.Display is great too, Responsiveness is amazing as well.The phone is very well built with glass on both sides. It has great screen, speedy processor and 2gigs of ram. It is pleasant to handle and everything is super fast. You can get google updates very quickly.Overall its nice to handle and good looking as well.I strongly recommend this to all smart phone users.
!###Alhough I have ordered a 16GB Nexus 4 I have received a 8GB one. I didnt have time to replace the item and I have accepted a credit back as a compensation. Phone is working fine but a we all know Nexus has no slot for add memomry and this is why the 16GB was orderd and not the 8gb one.                    This phone is easily as good or better than a phone twice the price. We couldn't be happier with it.                    Like!!!Call recording is impossible. It is a problem for me. The device is nice. Speaker could be better. Zzz vvv bbb nnn mmm nnn bbb bbb                    it really fast and has the latest android api, takes really great photos, the only downsize is the batery, it doesnt last more than a day                    I bought used phone in US.The condition this phone is good but a little expensive.Before using this phone, I used Nexus.Nexus 4 which is next version of nexus has better specifications.Screen recognizing is much smoother and faster.And the design is more attractive.Camera,, there is no more benefit than Nexus.But google phone is very efficient phone to use properly.                    I Love the premium and unique design of the Nexus 4 its much better than the Nexus 5 since it will still get the OS Updates and even if the specs are better they dont truly matter anymore.                    If you're looking for pure android experience, well this is the phone for you. Very fast and reliable. Would recommend to anyone.                    Excellent terminationAlways up to datePerforms like a charmacceptable photographs for nowadays phonesit's more wide than I can handle firmlythe surface is so smooth it can slide by it self in surfaces like a glass table with a very little breeze                    Much better than expected! Great design, excellent screen, very good performance, really fast. I totally recommend it, great phone at a very low price                    If you've never heard about the nexus line you have been missing out. These phones are fast and affordable. You don't have to break the bank to have the latest and greatest in tech. Check out all the nexus products for affordable phones/tablets that will make your inner nerd drool.
!###Amazing product. Excellent and fast :D this phone has a really good camera and is really fast running games and those things. Im really happy with the purshase. Really unlocked and from venezuela.                    Great phone for the price only complaint is that the touch screen becomes unresponsive especially to multi touch whenever the included charger is used.                    I first a had some problem with it. Nobody told that this phone use micro sim card instead regular so I have to cutted. I don't have problem with the phone it self, but the seller who never told about the  issues (micro card, 220v instead 120v) I write then about it and they answer was call nokia                    Very sleek and elegant design. Love the pure android experience. I recommend a very strong case in order to protect your investment especially if you drop your phone, I don't but believe in the saying an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Since both  back and front are made of glass you definitely want to add some grip to the device as well.                    It looks nice and clean, easy to use. I can use the map even without internet, that is really cool:)                    The handset its good overall. Good screen, fast, but, it has some glitches, perhaps due to android 4.3 where it overheats, suddenly switches off overnight, so you cannot rely on it for alarm clock.                    Very good good. i recommend it for everyone. It's gonna be perfect for everyone. However, It has to Extra SD slot.                    It's an incredible phone at a reasonable price and has always the Google support. The deilvery was on time. I recommend it!                    Before the Nexus 4 I had a Samsung Galaxy S3. The S3 is a great phone and I really liked it. There is just one thing that I disliked in the S3, the Touchwiz. The Samsung system is very heavy and the limited 1 GB RAM of the phone doesn't help.When my S3 died (my fault) I decided I want to try the &#34;pure&#34; Android experience, so I bought the N4.Definitely, if you like Android, the N4 is the best Android experience so far. The phone is blazing fast and it's 2 GB of RAM helps a lot! No more slowdowns or forced close apps.Of course there are some disadvantages. The camera is not that good (comparing with the S3 camera) and my old 32 GB sd card now is retired. Although, I'm loving this phone!                    I have chosen this phone because I love it! I'll recomend it to everybody! Thank you LG and Google for making this mobile phone!
!###It took a while to receive the phone since I am abroad of the States but so far It is just worth all the anxiety... The phone came properly sealed in a box, brand new and flawless no complaints whatsoever.With regards to the phone itself I must say that it looks gorgeous very sleek design high quality nothing cheap, the screen looks amazing very natural color unlike the amole screens that look saturated. The screen is also very sharp and the phone behaves very well. It is fast, intuitive and fluid.The sound is great very clean and I have not tested the c&aacute;mara very well yet but so far so good.I haven't had the phone long enough to say my last word about it, but this is my third android, first nexus and so far it's the best overall. I'll come back with a review later to say my last word about this babyUpdate 05/09/2013 downgrade.The phone has WiFi issues it appears to me that it's software related but I'm downgrading my inicial rating to 3 stars only because this is unacceptable... The download speed while watching stream video suddenly drops so much that you just can't go on anymore, though I must say that you can do light web browsing without problems but I'm concerned about software updates because they imply lots of data...I searched for this issue on the web and there's a lot of people having the same problem, some of them from December 2012 and the problem still remains nowadays. So I guess I'll have to wait like the others for Google to release a proper fix in a small file so you can download it...very disappointing and a shame given the fact that this is a great device considering pricing.Having said that the phone drains the battery quick but if you use a battery saving software that controls the data network connection and low the screen brightness to almost a minimum the screen still looks fine and saves a lot of power to the point that you can end the day with 20% of remaining battery on moderate use. Heavy use will drain the battery before the end of the day.Update November 2013WiFi issues were solved long ago in a software update, so I have no complains on the phone. It's just one of the best phones I've ever had. Nexus 5 has just been release but I won't update because I don't think it's worth it. I'll wait for Nexus 6 this phone will get me through most of 2014 without any problems                    After struggling for several months with a Samsung S3 (i-9300) with a sluggish performance (slow phone app performance, etc.) I decided to change it for the Nexus 4.In general the Nexus 4 has been a better experience for me, specially for it's better performance compared with the S3.After several months using it I can say it is superior than the S3 in general performance but the display quality is not so good as the S3.  The colors on the Nexus 4 are very washed-out compared to the stunning colors of the S3The other disadvantages are: fixed battery / no mSD card slot.In general the Nexus 4 is a better value than the S3, specially if you are demanding about performance.                    Im so happy. Now i have a great smartphone for very few money. its very cheap to have too much characteristics..Simple.. Wonderful.                    here is what I've learned after 3 months of having this phone. I was worried that the battery wouldn't last all day because I listen to a lot of podcasts at work. It does last all day. I do heavy use in the morning for about an hour, I use it as a reader for all my news sites and so on. I listen to about 6 hours of podcast per day. texting and light talking. it usually is just about dead at the end of the day. It is screaming fast and this version of android is the best so far. No regrets at all. oh also I run it on simple mobiles service which uses T-Mobile, so I only pay $45 a month for talk text and web! Can't beat that.                    super phone fine the best i love it very much good phone for work and joy play with child and not only                    It's my number 2 nexus 4. If you're thinking on buying one, do so, the phone is superb. Yet, it's a bit slippery and very very I repeat, VERY fragile. So buy a case. Mine is holding up perfectly with the Seidio Active one.Cheers!                    Over Priced on amazon? Slightly Yes! But worth it? Ofcourse! The Nexus 4 is twice faster than the Iphone 5.4.7 crisp HD. Perfect Size on hand. Android 4.2 Jelly Bean with constant software updates. 8MP Camera .... veryyy clear! & last but not least a Phenomenal Photo Sphere Camera!                    We get what we expect. This is genuine phone. Would have rated 5 if it was a bit cheaper. Overall satisfied.                    This smartphone is way better then I was expecting, the pure Android and the Quad-Core make it super fast, and beautiful, I couldn't have chosen a better one.                    The product is really amazing, matches all expectations. Despite the higher price compared to what can be purchased in google play, ease to buy makes it worth the value a little higher. I recommend to everyone
!###I've been an android user since the Motorola Droid, and by far the user experience on the Nexus 4 with Android 4.2, which updated to 4.3 during the first hour of use, and in some weeks will update to 4.4 it's simply awesome. Amazing job google, and more shame to Samsung and it's TouchWajjjj, HTC and all other companies which ruin the experience, and delay and block android updates.The really bad side, is that although amazing and in the correct line in terms of software... with all the spirit of Google, Android, Linux, etc... the hardware has some major flaws. How not include an external micro SD card slot, not interchangeable batteries, no radio, no MLH... it's a pitty, and the SD card and the battery, it's so Microsoft and Apple way that it's unbelievable Google could have accepted something like that. I hope on Android 4.4 they don't make it mandatory to use iTunes or Outlook.Not considering these major hardware omissions, what it is on the phone, and it's built quality is awesome. I would prefer hard buttons on the front instead of the screen ones. The led is implemented great, why not put hardware buttons next and under it? instead of the software ones (which can't wake the phone and make playing impossible). Also it would be good that the borders protrude 1 mm or less as to be able to use the phone without the bumper case, making it less slippery and add enough protection to put it on different surfaces without worrying of the glass getting scratched.The speaker is weak.And the battery doesn't last enough... if you are in a place with bad signal reception, the phone will drain all its battery in a couple of hours!!!...I miss my Galaxy Note 2, which could last for 2 days with no problem, and if it died on battery, I just poped in a fresh one. Also I have a 64 Gb card on it with all my mp3's and videos... I could hear radio and could reproduce videos, music or see pictures or manage/transfer files from & to a pen drive with a micro USB to USB connector, or output full HD videos through MHL to HDMI cable to any TV. The perfect thing would be a Galaxy Note 3/S4 with Android 4.3 with no Samsung Bloatware, which could update to last Android, with no need to be flashing firmwares, etc...                    most users will not need anything more..(I run AnTuTu benchmark application on my device and it scored 17126 points )                    This is the best phone money can buy. (Until nexus5 goes live). Few people seems to understand how is it so cheap, so they rather go for a most expensive option, thinking they might get better quality. For me, pure android experience is far better. And quality is top-notch. Once you go nexus, you can never go back. Only downside: battery life.                    I bought this phone to replace my old HTC One X in August, being aware that a new Nexus (5) would be coming out in the fall. The Nexus 4, is the best Android experience around. the LG handset performs extremely well in my everyday use. Battery, fast CPU response, and signal strength are just a few of the great things about this phone. Nexus phones always run the most current and unmodified versions of the Android OS, which gives users more longevity out of their devices.                    Love this phone. Very clear display and exactly what i ordered. However sometimes it gets really hot and the battery life isnt that great but overall im very happy with this purchase                    Unparalleled in the $300~$400 smart phones. Maybe the best design in the phones I ever processed. The screen is clear and smooth, and the difference between a 720P screen and a 1080P screen is tiny to my eyes. The OS is automatically upgraded to Android 4.3, which is quite handy and cool. The battery is fairly good, and needs to be charged about every 2 days. The camera is not the best, but quite enough for everyday use. It performs well in daytime, but produces some noise in the night.                    I got the 16 GB Nexus 4 at an incredible price of just $249 ($262 total), about a month ago, when Google reduced the price of the phone. I moved up from a feature phone (Tracfone LG 840G) and an iPod Touch. As you may know, the iPod Touch (I had the 4th gen) has all the capabilities of an iPhone/smartphone minus the phone-calling/data feature. Since I have access to very fast WiFi both at home and at work, I was using the iPod for my email, text messaging (using Google Voice/iMessage/etc) and had all the other typical smartphone apps and functions. And my "dumb" phone, obviously, was used for calling when I didn't have access to WiFi.Well, I was looking at upgrading and having just one device to carry around, and so when Google lowered the price of a device I was already interested in, I jumped in and got the Nexus 4.I got the phone directly from Google (it's more expensive elsewhere) and added the $15 Straight Talk AT&T micro SIM and their $45 30-day unlimited plan. So far (nearly a month) the phone has worked great and I love the Android OS. The phone is very fast and capable running a pure version of the latest OS (4.3). I also like the 4.7 inch screen.The lack of of an option to extend the 16 GB internal storage was disappointing at first, but I've since found that I don't really need any more space. For one, all my music (2000+ songs) are uploaded to Google Music and I just stream them. Also, I transfer or upload all the pics and videos before they fill up my phone. And lastly, all the essential apps that I've got so far have only used 3 GB of the phone's space -- leaving me with plenty more space to use.However, there are some things I do not like about the Nexus 4. The biggest issue is the battery life. Having used the iPod Touch as a smartphone-like device since it came out in 2010, I was expecting newer devices to have far better battery life. I do understand that compared to the iPod, this phone has a bigger screen and a faster processor (both of which use more power). But I still expected a better/longer battery life. Having tested the phone multiple times, I usually get about 8-10 hours of use -- one or two phone calls, a few texts, a few web page views -- nothing heavy. That, to me, is very disappointing. The phone is fairly light but I wouldn't have minded if it was a bit heavier, and had a bigger battery.Another gripe is about the brightness of the screen. Even at full brightness, the screen looks dimmer than the smaller iPod Touch's screen. I usually leave it on auto and it's fairly dim -- but I still get poor battery life.Now, before anyone comments about my phone usage, I'm not a heavy phone user and the phone spends a lot of time in my pocket. I also turn off anything I don't need (WiFi/Bluetooth/etc), but I still don't like the battery life I'm getting. The next big leap, I hope, is not towards bigger and bigger screens, but in extending the battery so that it'd last at least 24 hours in light use.Having said that, I do understand that there are phones out there with longer batter life and that the Nexus is a great value, but I still think that all phones from now on (now that we have the fastest processors, HD screens, etc), need improvements in battery life.I'll come back and edit my review if anything changes. But for now, to summarize the review, I'd encourage anyone to get this phone if you want a truly unlocked GSM phone with pure Android experience. Even though the phone is no longer available from Google, it can still be found elsewhere and is a great phone for anyone upgrading from a feature phone or not wanting a contract.                    Great phone, fast, reliable, software works great and everything updates automatically.Battery could last a little longer.Speaker is a bit low, for example when using it as GPS in the car it is hard to hear instructions                    It was an excellent purchase. I am very happy with my phone considering its capacity, speed, performance and price. I recommend it.                    smart, comfortable and fairly priced. the best phone I ever had. hope it's lasts long enough, 'cause I don't like to buy a new phone every year.
!###It is a google product, very well finished, good sizing, fast and with a great Operation System. It is the best phone you will find around.                    You guys know everything you need to know about the phone. What I came here to say was please order this through google. I got the same phone for $50 cheaper and it does not come with anything added on it.                    this is a top of the art phone. Simply awesome. I had to cut my sim card in order to use it locally                    I love this cellphone!It' stable, fast and looks very nice!The bad is that some application that I bought does not work in this android version but I do not mind. There are thousand of other applications!Other thing is that this device is very frail you should invest in some protection                    The best phone of google, is among the top 5 in the world for sure. Beautiful phone, fast and meets expectations.                    Works great in Mexico, it's really a competitive price, i have no complains about it, it is a really good choice in smatphones                    I'm extremely happy with this phone. Best phone i ever had. I like that it doesn't come with useless pre loaded apps. 16 gigs is enough for my use. Would highly recommend this phone to anyone.                    I like this product because is a excelente phone ! Is the fastest smartphone ! This phone always have the last version of android and its do that have so much options                    is one of the best android phones, is very fast! provides the experience "pure google" and compilment the official update immediately.the only drawback is that I give the sound through the headphones is very low compared to phones like the iphone.saludos desde venezuela!!                    Very good phone for a very good price.Beter than galaxy 3.few things to be considerThere is no headphone in the packBattery life little short
!###i was in an important call and this s*** dialed astrixx and some numbers making the call useless.  I dont even want to try and get that call cause Tmobile's customer service sucks.  I hate this phone for what it does.. it is not a phone .. its just a mediocre tablet.                    This phone is way over hyped. Sending mine back. Out of the box yesterday the 4G will not work. The LG build is subpar compared to a Samsung. The only reason I wanted the Nexus 4 was for the quad core chip set, and the minimalist Android-only UI. Wow, what a disappointment. Sorry LG. Samsung Galaxy S III here I come!                    I bought one of these through google play shortly before moving to Italy. I bought this phone specifically because it is supposedly global. After installing a SIM card I discovered that everything works...except phone calls. Seriously? I can Skype call, text message, use the internet, etc - but no phone calls. Since I'm already in Italy I knew I would have trouble getting help. I called Google in London and the US, but none of them could help me. They suggested replacing the phone under warranty.They want ME to pay to ship the phone back to the US to get it replaced. Then they will send a new one to a US address...meaning I will also have to pay to ship the phone back to Italy! Ridiculous. A company as big as Google should be able to handle a simple RMA, especially since they will be selling them in Italy soon.Other than Google's complete lack of "global" service, the phone is pretty nice. I don't like that I can't get rid of the google search bar, and the phone feels a inferior in every way to the Galaxy S3 I had been using.If I could go back in time I would have gotten an unlocked GS3, NOT the Nexus 4. Even if phone calls worked right it just isn't as intuitive or polished as the GS3...I will never be buying another Google phone. Pure android? Pure crap.Having good customer service is worth having the bloatware that US providers put on the real flagship phones. I won't be buying anything directly through Google play again. Warranty is basically invalid if you actually go global with this "global unlocked" phone.                    I'll start by saying that the box says &#34;The best of Google&#34;, well, it is not. The problem I had with this phone is that the touch display is not that good, really, it's really bad, you can get a better touch display on the Samsung Galaxy S3 if you want an Android and it's not even close to the precision on the iPhone 5, when you are pinching you can realize how it doesn't start to zoom until the fingers are very spread, some times touching a single button won't work, you have to touch around. Second, the battery, there must be a draining issue as the battery doesn't last much with average use, and I usually charge the phone every night, but this one never made it past 2pm in my day without dying on me. Third the screen and camera are not that great, I didn't like the pictures I took with this phone. Last, the speed, it's not that fast, scrolling is clumsy, didn't get to play a game on it, but the overall UI doesn't perform well in my opinion.I know it's a &#34;Nexus&#34; and it's supposed to be the best, well, I don't think it is, I returned mine after 4 days of use, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.                    As previous said it is very fragile. Once screen is cracked, the whole phone is useless. Google and LG Customer service are terrible. If google takes a little money out of employee buffet lunch, they would have approved a lot.  I begged LG where can I BUY screen parts, they the guy at customer service asked manager and  came back to me and suggested eBay or free market. My 21 day old nexus 4 is dead. Daily amortization is about $20.                    Good phone 4/5 stars. You can get the 8gb version for only 299 brand new directly from Google. For 299 this is an excellent phone. However, it is not as good as the Galaxy S3 or Galaxy Note 2. I would even prefer the HTC One X since it has jelly bean.  You can get an HTC One X used off Amazon for less money.  Worth it.                    Not a bad product, but it is a copy of the iPhone, so just give it 3 stars, I think it must be original and not copy, the box is equal to the iPhone's box :-(                    BOUGHT THIS PHONE AT THE PLAYSTORE ONCE IT WENT DOWN TO $199 FOR THE 8GB VERSION BUT HAD LET EVERYONE KNOW. The phone itself is beautiful phone, but that's where anything good about this phone begins and stops.I have t-mobile and had bought an atrix HD(unlocked) a few weeks ago prior to buying this phone to see how good it performed with T-Mobile--the atrix has LTE which I can fully access where the service is available from T-Mobile just by adding the APN "fast.T-Mobile.com" in the mobile network settings of the phone. Needless to say the nexus 4 SUCKS!!!! The atrix has better battery life,has LTE, better screen resolution(higher PPI) and brightness, has SD card slot, takes better/faster camera shots...there might have been something I missed...but there you go!!!                    If this is your first Smart phone you could be very happy with it, but if you have already had experience with a well implemented phone this one is just painful.  At first I thought that maybe the odd ticks and bugs where just the way Android was.  When I finally saw Android on the Samsung SIII though I could not believe the difference.  It was hard to believe they were using the same OS (Android).  Samsung's Android implementation is worlds better than this one.  It is hard to believe that the phone Google is selling could have implemented Google's OS so badly.There are so many things that make the experience on the Nexus4 painful.  For example.  If you click on a link that is a PDF.  Every other phone will open a PDF viewer automatically so you are able to view the file.  One step and you are done.  The Nexus4 downloads the PDF of the phone to a folder and pops up a little window to say "downloading.".  So you have to close the browser, then go find the downloads folder, then try to figure out which file in the downloads folder it is that it just downloaded, then click on the file then, and THEN select what app should be used to view the file.  Five steps.  Something so simple that is made so difficult gives you an idea of how needlessly hard this phone can be to use.  Pros:  * Complete freedom.  The phone is totally unlocked and supports GSM and CDMA so you can take it with you to any phone company and use it with no contracts.  Con:  * Terrible Android implementation.  See the description above for details.  This one was the deal breaker for me.  This is painful to use compared to Samsung's Android implementation.  * No expansion slots for added memory.  * Really high bandwidth usage.  You will need a MUCH more expensive data plan.  Since the phone can not store much with it's limited storage it constantly needs to go to the Google services to download contacts, music, photos, etc.  So you need one of the highest end data plans.  * Battery life is nowhere near what is claimed.  Plan on having it plugged in pretty much everywhere you go.  * No LTE support.  I did not really care, but if you hate network lag this may get on your nerves.                    Google Lg Nexus 4 16gb - Unlocked w/ caseIt's awful &#65281; I think it's used &#65281; im very disappointed&#65281;
!###I like the Phone easy to use smooth light nice black color :)I love it Thanks to Google :)                    Overall the phone is pretty good.  The screen itself is sharp and the clarity is great.  The only problem I have is that the colors are extremely washed out.  When I compare it to my old Samsung galaxy S2 screen, my samsung phone beats it hands down on color quality.  The nexus 4 settings currently have no options to fix this.  The only way to fix it is to root your phone (which immediately voids any warranty) and download some kernels or pay a few bucks for someones app that will work on a rooted phone.  If you are considering buying this phone, I'd check it out at a store first against your current phones color scheme and see if you can live with it.  I gave it 3 stars because I expected more from google in this area, and didn't think it would be an issue (Even my old samsung S2 comes with 3 presets to choose from).  Otherwise, the phone works great and no complaints.                    The build quality of the phone is great.It feels like a premium device, despite its no-nonsense, straightforward look amazing                    Really great stuffBecause this is a gift for a friendShe very likeI will continue to buythanks                    I really think that it is a very good machine. It is also much cheaper than equivalent options. A good choise for sure.                    This is a good product. We bought it to replace the current cell phone we are using. It works well.                    My previous Google Nexus phone bit the dust this summer - kept turning off in the middle of conversations. Time for a new phone. I considered both Android and I-Phones before buying and decided that, since I know the Android OS and apps, this was the best bang for the buck. I LOVE IT!  As far as I'm concerned it does everything I would need an i-Phone to do and just as well. For the first time ever, I really CAN do everything on my phone while away from home.It's a bit bigger than I expected, but thinner so I'm not really dealing with more bulk. The current Android OS is more intuitive than previous versions and you can do most anything with a quick swipe. The virtual keyboard is easy to use even with fat fingers.  Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this phone and pleased that I bought it!                    Love it!! Everything works perfectly!! And it was MINT!! Perfect conditions. Works just as new. Totally recommended.  Now I can say that my life is easier thanks to this phone.                    Great phone. It's quite big, but very powerful. Run great all app that i download! Games also run very fast!                    Good size phone its high resolution and quality great price very happy with it.its bigger than most phones so its easy to use great product.
!###This phone is for those who like pure android experience. I do have to say that the user interface is not as colourful as samsung's touchwiz or Htc' sense but both of those have lag but not nexus 4 as this has jellybean with android 4.2.2. You are first in line for all the updates before all other OEM's. Great price from google store if your country has it.                    lacked wireless charger and the key for the SIM. The cellphone is amazing.I recommend this phone for everyone. Incredible quality.                    I love the n4. Great quality and great price. The only problem its the rear glass, but you can use a back film protector                    Top smartphone and the best Android pure experience.Awesome multitask, great screen, and everything runs pretty smooth, due of the 2GB RAM and the quad-core processor.                    I'm new to smart phones, and can't speak much as to the phone itself.The phone works as a phone and connects to the internet through Wifi or 3G/ HSPA+.  I'm using T-mobile and a pay as you go plan and T-mobile SIM cardfrom Walmart.Though the delivery was very prompt, the phone was all that was delivered,even though the Amazon posting indicated that there would be 'extras'included for the price.  The price was about $25 more than purchasing fromGoogle direct [using Prime which included 2 day shipping.].  I had expectedthat I would receive more than just fast shipping.  It may be that these willcome later from 'Electronics Club,' but I have my doubts.Technical DetailsComes With Extra'sBrand New Still in PackageCaseFull Body Front and Back Screen ProtectorApparently not all of the vendors using this common posting through Amazon adhereto the Amazon listing.  If a vendor working through Amazon isn't going to beproviding the extras, there should be a separate listing that clearly notes thatonly the phone is provided.I discovered that the screen comes with a Screen Protector from Google.                    It dose not annoying, that's makes him the best. Heart accessibility to every function. Great looks also. I glad I bought this one.                    What sets this apart is its speed. It feels like a small PC. The processor is just amazing. Love it!                    THIS PHONE IS MORE THAN AMAZING !I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE PRICE IS GREAT AND THE DEVICE IS THE BEST ANDROID PHONE IVE EVER USEDLOVE THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ! IS REALLY FAST ! AND RESPONSIVE ! :DI TOTALLY RECOMMEND !! THIS TO EVERYONE ! :DWORDS WONT DESCRIBE HOW AMAZING THIS PHONE IS !                    Amazing phone. Its fast beautiful has a great screen easy to use and most of all priced at an affordable price for such a high end phone.                    It's my first contact with Android as an owner.Very fast, nice looking and perfect in hands.Cons: 32Gb should be great !
!###I Have had IOS since the the original iphone, and I have to say that the switch to android (via the nexus 4) was the best choice I've ever made. I love this phone. And am definitely going to get the nexus 5 when its released and available. I will never pay what apple wants for their phones again.                    This is an amazing phone. Look great and TVE hardware is excelent. For this prive is the better phone. Is wonderfull.                    Its perfect. Even better than i thought. Nexus is very very fast. The best price and the best perfomance. Nothing to complain.                    Dely was prompt product is nice and well packed with features and options as all other similar Andorid products, very pleased with the unit and performance                    very fast phone, stock android is perfect for someone like me who uses the phone very minimalistically. put a screen protector for the glass on the back side. After a week of use, it was getting chipped and scratched like no other, already looks a year old on the back.                    I got this phone as a replacement for the Iphone 4S,Im really happy with the phone.But its really fragile. In one month the back cover got broken with a noticed scratch. Dont know how it happened. But I will need to get a case for the phone.Its really fast and ver yeasy to use..                    I really like it a lot, I was using the sammsung nexus 3 and this one is much better, my only complain would be, that I paid 350 dollars and two weeks later there was a 100 dollars reduction on the price                    I got my cell phone yesterday and &#305; didn't left it since &#305; got it. Awesome touch screen really quick. Shipment was really fast. Thanks a lot                    Slick user experience if you are wanting a stock android phone. easy to customize and easy to tweak, if you are into that stuff. Vanilla android is the only version of android I want to use after playing around with this beauty and the nexus 7.                    I really love its designed and looking forward into staying with the nexus line ! And really happy to get the latest version of android
!###i broke the screen in 3 days, dropped from my belts height and it broke in pieces .. caused me more 5k.otherwise the phone is great , no lagging can run many apps at one time .. i tried with 15 apps and it was running great..                    This is an excellent phone with latest android version.Display, sound, size, apps everything are outstandingGlass front and back gives a premium look and feel.The only downside is lack of SD card slot. But thats ok as we have clod storage to upload photos and videos instantly.                    cons - It doesnt come with earphones, a little bit heavy.pros - robust, fast.It worth it for the price.                    I use it since one month now and it is meeting my expectation. Great phone for this price! I don't regret the choice.                    great phone. great seller, for the amount of money by far best phone out there. smart sleek design, battery life is great                    Great Cellphone ... I am enjoying it ... I've received the product as Described  but first i had concerns because it wasn't sealed .. But after using it i am sure that it was brand new                    So far I love my google nexus 4. Its quick and has a wonderful feel. It sometimes gets warm when you play games but its nothing to worry about. I just love it                    love itI have htc one and i got nexus 4 too because of its puritycheap price with many featuresif you are looking for great phone with cheap price and pure android get Nexus 4 it's hardly recommended                    This is just the best android an average user can buyThe pricePure android experienceAlways first to receive updates from GoogleNFC capableNo bloatware just few apps that u really need.The phone itself is just amazing I've been using it on gaming texting talk streaming web surfing android beam  video recording even making payments via NFC using the Google wallet and its been a great experience                    excellent device, only prblem is that the screen ges hot some times, and cellphone freezes sometimes, but that doesn't afect the android OS at all
!###Got this phone in my hands and I can't say I regret my purchase. Got it fast and in great condition. Using it to write this review right now. Phone is fast and responsive. Great buy. Great service. Thanks Amazon!                    Hi all!I've been using the phone for about a week and its works fantastic! love it in every way since i am a google fan...now i have everything syncronized (youtube, gmail. gtalk= and makes my life really pleasant...the mobile itself is really light and is big enough to watch video and have good conference calls...also the graphics are amazing and th images resolutions workis more than fine too...i hardly recommend this phone for all google users....                    In short:  This is a great phone; don't let the low price fool you...  I haven't used my iPhone 4s since purchasing...Snapdragon processor is quick and snappy. :) This phone runs Android 4.2.2 extremely well.  All transitions are butter-smooth and applications launch promptly.  To be perfectly honest, this phone is actually smoother than my Nexus 10, for reference.  If you've been looking for a wonderful, pure Android phone experience, this is it.External speaker is just okay, nothing extremely special--it works.  Phone is well built--solid, yet light, and soft/smooth in the hand.  The subtle, curved glass front adds a nice touch to the phones finish, and it is effective for allowing one's finger to smoothly glide across the screen from the side.  The phone is glass front and back, so putting it in a case is pretty much a no-brainer.  Regardless of what anti-scratch techniques are used, glass will still be fragile, and if dropped, _will_ break if not properly protected.  This phone is no exception to that.  Additionally, the glass back makes the phone especially slippery.  Slippery both in the hand, _and_ most importantly, it slips on surfaces.  When I first got this phone, it arrived before the case.  During those 2 days, I could have sworn that this phone sprouted legs and walked across seemingly flat surfaces when I wasn't looking!  I am not joking, this phone is super smooth...and slippery.  Luckily for me, I noticed before it had a chance to fall.  You've been warned. :)Overall, I am happy that I purchased this phone.  In truth, I haven't been able to put it down since purchase.                    This is by far the best phone I've ever owned, you can't get a better phone for the price. This is my second nexus device and I plan on buying future nexus devices.                    It is fast, Doesent fail. Android 4.2 works smothly. The batery life its about 8 hrs of normal use, 6 if u used a lot (like me)                    Very beautiful, a device with great build quality, great screen resolution and good camera.ProsNFC- I'm just now getting into using NFCConsNo expandable memory                    The Nexus 4 is a great Phone from Google and LG.It's half price that it competitor and can fight with any of these overpriced smartphones. :)So far, great camera, great screen, and good battery life.                    The screen is gorgeous, one of the best screens I've seen to date. It's an incredibly fast phone, even running demanding games goes without occasional glitches.The only thing I'm missing is expandable storage...                    It is far the best cell phone I ever had. Excellent amount of RAM and good processor are the major qualities of this phone.                    I think it's a good Phone, I think the best of this is the fact you have software updates directly from Google.
!###finally an android phone that really works. excellent integration with google services, lots of RAM and a good price. and finally no bloatware.                    My last phone was a Sony Xperia Arc LT15a. I love the design of Sony Xperia but it was getting slow beacuse the lack of memmory. The Nexus 4 is perfect when you consider the performance. I can do everything i did on my last phone with a excellent performance. I just wanted Google to make more accessories as Apple does.Just some Information in Portuguese: Coloquei um chip da vivo e funcionou perfeitamente, sem problemas.                    Excellent device and a great sellerI liked the device and easy to deal withAnd distinctive shape of the device and LG Electronics trusted                    This phone is the best by far. It's not heavy, its battery last long and it's fast.Android, of course.Happy and enjoying it!                    Everything about the phone is great except the volume. It's unusable as a music player. It's really quiet with large headphones and isn't even loud enough for ear buds. The speaker volume is also low. I have no idea why it can't be as loud as an iPod. I guess they messed up the design.                    This cellphone is amazing, the camera was not so good , but the screen is perfect , have a good size and wonderfull quality , i recommend.                    Outstanding product, I am very impressed with this product.... changed from Samsung to LG sacred me in the begining, but it is a very nice mobile device.                    I has amazing speed and performance. Everything is flawless on this phone. The best phone I've had thus far. It could be a little smaller, but you get used to the size. Only thing it did bother me is that it didn't come with headphones.                    The cellphone is great, thank you for shipping it so quickly! I'm so glad it is really unlocked so I can use it where I live, in Brazil!                    i like it because it has big screen,google play and anothers stuff, but the battery life is not good enough, its like a mini 4.7 tablet, not games in my phone because the battery life is a problem. with normal use my battery last almost a day.decent photos,but nice and good looking phone,my complain is the battery
!###It is a good device, but there seems to be no initial opportunity to sync with MS LiveId, I used to have Windows phone and I could have contacts on both LiveID and Google accounts. Now I need to join them in one account That's why I set 4 stars.                    The phone is functionally excellent. It breaks easier than ice. I'm really giving a 3.5 Star review.You absolutely need a case for this phone. The glass is very fragile, and the digitizer breaks very easily. It's good for the price, but let's be smart here google/ LG... Don't make a glass phone.... That's what I hate about iphones, and now what I hate about the nexus. Parts are also expensive to repair, but easy to do with an online video.Samsung phones hold up a lot better, and are good for people who are slightly clumsy.                    I've had a Galaxy Nexus, and, even though it receives the updates, buying the Nexus 4 was totally worth it.Finally Android has reached a stage where the navigation is fluid, smooth, and you experience almost no bugs at all time.4.2.2 Jelly Bean, and now 4.3, are the best OS' Google has ever made. The top hardware of this phone makes everything faster. And, as Key Lime Pie is expected to be developed to run on even low/mid-end devices, you don't have to worry about the future version.I totally recommend it. Pure Android is the best experience you can have with Google's OS, as it is the system exactly as Google developed it to be.                    Loved the Nexus 4 I've got!! Increadible device, very fast, easy to use!! Enjoying it more every day!!! I recommend it for sure!!                    Excellent, the better android and a good hardware, excellent touch screen, good camera, the durability of the battery is one day with all services on.                    Like any other product, the Nexus 4 has its good points and its not so good points. Since I am, by nature, a seeker of improvement opportunities, here are a few (after three weeks of using the phone, and upgrading to Android 4.3):- Having come from a smartphone with a 3.5 inch screen, I find the width a little unwieldy, but I am getting used to it.- I installed another keyboard from the native Android set. Instead of simply *adding* the globe key which changes keyboards, the system *replaced* the comma on the English keyboard with the globe. Not convenient.- The staying power of the battery is not as advertised. With nothing active on a regular basis (not Bluetooth, not WiFi, not Auto Sync, Data Transfer turned off, there is no radio...), the battery is half run down in 14 hours. And I use the telephone less than 30 minutes in a day. (So why did I spend so much money on a phone? - Ah, that's also a good question.)- A solution to this situation would be to carry a spare, fully-charged battery. But the battery in a Nexus 4 is not removable.- The Nexus 4 was recommended by folks at work who are highly knowledgeable about such things. One of the points they made is that, with no service provider involved, I would be getting native Android, without all the bells and whistles added by service providers. Not true. There is a whole bunch of Google stuff included which I will never use, and which I cannot remove.On the plus side:- The sync is almost instantaneous - and I have as much stuff to synchronize as I did on my previous phone, where it took five minutes or more (with 4GB of memory, as opposed to the 16GB I have here).- On my previous phone, the pull bar on the Contacts list went from A to Z and then &#34;other&#34;. On the Nexus, the order is A to Z and then my second alphabet, letter by letter, from beginning to end. A really handy improvement.- I am not a major user of the camera. However, for those times I have used it, it has performed well and given me crystal-clear, well-defined pictures. (I haven't yet used the video feature.)Now I intend to read through the user manual (over 200 pages) and really learn about the phone. I hope to revise this review as I go along. 2013-08-16.                    Meets almost all expectations.Just that the signal reception is a little on the poorer side.Heats up upon heavy Wifi/3G usage.Performance seems to be pretty good otherwise.                    The best androind experience around. The fastes snappiest Android ever. I love it so much.It worked in my Carrier here in Uruguay, unlocked so you can use it in almost every country. I strongly recommend it                    I SO HAPPY WITH MY NEW GOOGLE NEXUS 4 UNLOCKED GSM.GOOD PRICE AND GOOD PRODUCT THE PHONE ITS SO BEATUFIL                    Great phone with fine feature, i like it and i would not trade it for no other phone. a great purchase for my money
!###Smarter and faster, it is a good option to have a useful device if you are looking for quality and desgin                    the best part about this phone is the Google version of Android. i was originally very happy with it, especially the sparkling back. the battery is not good at all and for some reason the phone decides to annoy you about it with popups and beeps when it reaches 14%. i can't find any way to turn that off. the glass is supposed to be Corning Gorilla 2, but i already have a crack or scratch on the back. i may not buy a Nexus phone again.30 July 2013 update:Android 4.3 OTA went out on 24 July. it is now almost a week later and my Google Play Nexus 4 will not update. not only was Google unable to fulfil my order when i placed it on launch day, but now i can't even get the newest version of Android sent to my phone! this makes me want to just get a dumbphone and take my laptop everywhere i go for my wifi internet fix.                    Just doing the first initial configuration today. Seems very responsive, excelletn screen, colours, definition, etc. Need to get used because I'm coming from a Samsung Galaxy Ace, some options are different in Jelly Bean from Gingerbread. One thing I don't like very much is to have everything related to google, with many things opening while not asked to... but the price for all the specs, sounded like a great deal, that's why I bought it.                    I bought this phone after reading excellent reviews at Amazon and elsewhere. I bought it from Google Play store directly - saved a few dollarsThe only con is no ability to insert an exernal micro SDHC cardThe pros:- camera has an auto panorama stitcher mode - this was very important to me- after taking a pic - decent options to edit - crop, fix, frame - enough for me- I only use wifi about couple hours at a time - 2 or 3 times a day - it connects to the stored wifi signal almost twice as fast as samsung galaxy/note. Whole day usage does not drain the battery.- everything is zippier - memory management does not seem necessary (in my 2 days thus far) - I am running Gmail, calendar, Gtasks, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Camera, Phone contacts, Settings, Maps concurrently  am at 600 MB onlyGet it                    My best smartphone ever...  :-)work faster, the battery support all day... really this is my best smartphone (better than S2 and S3).                    I received the item as described, received item on time in mint condition. Upon opening the box, I saw the most beautiful sexy phone ever!! I love my new Nexus 4, its fast and it goes (open) through apps effortlessly!!! I was able to open at least 15 apps and there was no lag what so ever!! I recommend buying from this seller and I especially recommend investing in a Nexus 4!!! This is truly a good investment!                    I got tmy Nexus 4 recently through amazon, and I must admit I was surprised by the high quality of it. Also, Jelly Bean is an excellent system. I was really happy with it, until I started to notice that at home or office, when connected to wifi networks, push notifications were taking up to 30 minutes when screen was off, but they were immediate when on 3G. I found this is a common problem for this phone. I think google will fix it in the next update of Jelly Bean, You can read more about this issue on http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/mobile/SQH6JnIFYcQ%5B1-25-false%5D                    I really like this phone. It have interesting features and i can do a lot of stuff using this phone, It's the best investment that i've done.                    Upgraded from a Galaxy S II (T-989) to this white Google Nexus 4. I ordered it from google play. It is a great phone and I am glad I bought it. Their price is great (with tax and shipping $388) and it came with a free bumper. I have the Walmart family mobile plan so I had to buy a micro-sim cutter to cut down the sim card so it would fit. I used the 2nd gen Noosy cutter and it worked perfectly. I would recommend this phone, it does too much for me to list and the price from google is unbeatable.                    The real potential of android and you can exploit all the features of the system,  a piece of hardware and software well balanced, the only cons is high price , in relation with google play
!###good mobile. I like its design, price, soft & hardwareI recommend this google nexus 4 gsm phone to other                    Ah, let me see... The best android devices there are? I think NEXUS. mainly because of the stock android pure google experience. No OEM skins bogging down the performance. seamless, bugless, smooth android. Only one downfall. With the last phone (Galaxy Nexus by Samsung), google introduced 4G LTE into the nexus lineup, and with this next update, they took it back out! WHY GOOGLE WHY? other than that, this phone is a monster. NO hiccups anywhere! with 2GB of RAM how can you go wrong? This phone's design mirrors that of the iPhone 4. No, there is no stainless steel band running around the perimeter of the phone acting as an antenna, but there is gorilla glass panning the front and the back of this phone. another little minor feature that every user appreciates but doesn't really notice during every day use is the little glitter specks lighting up the back of the phone in a ray of bright dots. The phone has an 8MP camera sensor and a 1.3MP sensor on the front bringing beautiful clear shots with a minute lens. Google incorporates "photosphere" (360 panorama) into all of its newest nexus devices running android 4.2 Jellybean or higher, and the ability to upload them to google maps for the rest of the world to see which is nice. Gaming performance is flawless on that Snapdragon S4 Pro processor and beautiful on that 320 PPI 4.7 inch display. And you just cant go wrong with the insanely cheap price of this amazing phone. CONVERT TO PURE GOOGLE!                    I think this is very good smartphone it has great powerI remember days when desktop computers with equivalent power didn't existedthis phone has very good touch screen way more better than old iphones ( I haven't tried it against iPhone 5  )if you use wifi lot and play high quality graphic games you may kill battery in hoursbut when you're using it like phone battery will last couple of daysin addition this phone has great visual design I'll say one of the best                    I bought this Nexus 4 as a birthday present for my wife. It was in perfect condition and my wife simply loves it. I highly recommend the phone as well as the seller. Thank you.                    I've been using mine for 3 months now and it is brilliant! The phone is sleek, smooth and surprisingly light. After using other relatively low end android phones, the switch is like moving to a Nissan GTR after driving a Micra.I like the swype style input mode but it still has a long way to go being as intuitive. The screen is good and even when it's off seems to have a certain black shine to it. No issues running multiple apps though it does tend to heat a lot sometimes. Overall sturdy build but I was forewarned about the back panel being fragile. Please invest in a good case as there have been reports of cracks being extended onto the screen owing to the moulded screen design that wraps around.Just updated to 4.3, feels good getting updates directly instead of relying on the firmware updates by other manufacturers. Screen size is ample, though a tiny bit smaller would've helped. I have big hands but I find that sometimes while selecting a corner on the right using one hand, my hand tends to select the option on the left side.Battery life is decent and you can get through a full day with both wifi and mobile network on. Games work flawlessly and the hold and playing feels good due to the phone's aesthetics. Videos play well but the default player might not be able to handle all HD videos well or play formats like MKV. MX player is a good alternative. Organizer - Google Now is very intuitive and will pick up on your searches/routes traveled/ places you like to eat and a whole lot of other stuff to make life easy.The home screen switching with customizable widgets let you get all your updates without having to unlock the phone. Be warned though using a pin/passcode screen lock will limit this functionality sometimes(especially using Exchange configuring office email).Sound quality is good but volume level has scope for improvement. If you're not buying the earphones from google(no they are not part of standard package), please test out any earphones before you buy.Camera quality is good but ones taken in low light might not always be good. The 360 view takes a bit getting used to(and makes you look like an idiot sometimes :P when you are trying to align the other frames to the original reference one). Don't expect it to replace your digital camera but decent enough for family pics and nights out.Overall, this is the best phone you can get in this price range. Highly recommended.                    Nice looking and functional phone.  Love having an unlocked phone and the options that comes with it.  Already received the OS update.  The one dislike I have is the placement of the volume rocker.  I often push it one way or the other because of the position. Other wise it's a nice device with more than enough features for most.. if not all.                    Good performance, easy to use, android version updated to 4.3 improved animations and battery lasting, free 50gb in my Box account (cloud storage), for a affordable price.                    My sister want to buy a phone, i recommended it this one, she get crazy and start to install all the apps that she has listened before.                    The Nexus 4 is not far behind Samsung Galaxy S4 but cost 75% less!Google's &#34;pure&#34; Android is exellent and everything responde fast as expected.Probobly the best choice of smartphone as in today.                    I like this phone very much. Also I am a fan of Google company!This product is highly recommended and the performance is perfect.
!###This is a good phone. Just be aware guys that sometimes in Nexus 4 if you screen protector it hides you proximity sensor and that's why it turns off display when you call someone. So you might have to cut the screen protector a little. But overall it's a great phone!                    Prior to my cell phone purchase, I was decided between the Samsung Galaxy SIII and the Google Nexus 4.  I chose the Nexus 4 and am so happy with my choice!!!  The phone is snappy fast, has an excellent camera, is unlocked, and has very fast surfing! The battery life is AMAZING and it always has the most current Android software (case in point: I just received an update over the air to Android 4.3.)  The phone is beautiful as well, although I made sure to place it in a hard white case.  Do not waste your time and money on any other phone! Highly recommended!                    Fluid, cheap, cool and the most important i have android 4.3 3 days after the announcement... what else can I ask?                    If you are looking for a great smart phone for an great price then the LG Nexus 4 for for you.  It is made of glass with rubber edges so it feels great in the hand.  This phone will always get the most up to date android updates as it is a flagship device.  The only downside is the lack of LTE support.  If you are on T-mobile you can pick it up.  Sorry ATT.                    I did a head to head comparison between the HTC one and the Nexus 4 you can take a look and see how these two top phones compete against each other.[...]                    This is the best phone I have ever used (the best for me), I love it's screen size, I love everything about this phone. Really worth the price.                    I love this device. It is faster in its category. And is the best when you get the major internet velocity that ISP offer. This apply in the case like my country where the ISP company offer less velocity than the countries of the first world.I recommend this device 100%                    A very practical,  state-of-the-art, affordable, and friendly device with the flexibility needed to be a great companion for work and spare times.                    I love this phone.....the best phone at the best price!!!!! Who needs to use a computer anymore? And its so easy to use.                    This is the best phone for this price, with 2GB of ram you'll run all aplications at once. Everything rooms smooth and because it is a nexus, you'll receive futures updates.
!###Excelente tel&eacute;fono lo compre para usarlo en Venezuela y funciona perfectamente en 3g con la operadora DIGITEL, recomiendo el equipo ampliamente la mejor relacion  precio / calidad / tecnolog&iacute;a, muy r&aacute;pido  y la bateria aguanta tranquilamente 1 dia de uso fuerte                    Got my 16gb version delivered on Jan 2nd from Google. Put in the microSIM (got it free from local Tmobile store) activated, set up phone with my email etc and up and running in  few minutes. Have put the phone to test to check if it has any of the early batch issues. So far haven't found any.Here are a few observations:Speed:I used to get about 4mb speed with Galaxy Exhibit, on Nexus 4 I am getting between 8mb to 13mb on average in my daily usage area. Plenty fast for anything I want to do on my phone.Cover:Put Diztronic Matte Back Black Flexible TPU Case for LG Nexus 4 - Retail Packaging case and it looks great. Yes can't see the back side Nexus 4 logo. But I guess I could have waited for the translucent version. No big deal.No heating issue :Have tested for the heating issue by browsing internet for an hour. Phone gets a bit warm but definitely not hot.Camera:Camera is of high quality. One needs to learn the different setting. A little bit of practice on Photosphere needed. I was able to take some fantastic pictures.Battery life:One hour of web browsing (I use Dolphin browser) takes bertween 25% to 28% of battery. No different than any other high end Android (that don't even have quad core CPUs).All I can say is the phone is simply excellent: blazing fast, super smooth, Android Jelly bean is miles ahead of the competition as one learns the seemingly never ending features, unlocked, carrier bloat free and of course contract free.This is truly a game changer device from Google. By selling a very high end device at low cost Google is sending chills down the spines of other device makers and carriers. And giving consumers the freedom.Now some info for the curious:You can check the manufacturing info online with your phone IMEI number.csmg.lgmobile.com:9002/csmg/b2c/client/auth_model_check2.jsp?esn=[your device IMEI]In Chrome browser it would return you a string such as shown below(in IE8 you will see it in XML format):2 [IMEI entered] LGE960 AUSGBK 212KPDT330426 20121219 GLOBAL/GLOBAL N NThe manufacturing date is the numbers before the words GLOBAL/GLOBAL. It is the format YYYYMMDD.BTW, dial *#06# on your keypad to get the IMEI displayed on your phone.                    I called Google yesterday, with full intention of getting an RMA number and returning the phone.  The representative convinced me to try one master reset of the device (which worked perfectly as far as restoring contacts, calendar, previously installed apps, etc.), and see if by any chance it makes a difference on battery drain.  To say I was skeptical is an understatement.  With 23 hours and 16 minutes of very low use of the phone two days ago, I woke up yesterday morning to a completely discharged battery.  Totally dead less than 24 hours after the last 100% charge.  So needless to say, I was fully expecting to be talking with Google again today to finalize return of the phone.  Not so!In the previous version of this review (a 2-star rating) I said, "If it fixes itself with the reset, I'll update this review.  If the review isn't updated, you'll know it went back to Google with no swap."I have no idea what might have been wrong, but I've used the phone considerably more yesterday and today since the total reset and it's been over 25 hours since it's last been on a charger.  Current battery life?  Still 44% remaining!  I can't argue with that, since the usage has been far heavier.  So, on to other phone features I've been able to check out since receiving it almost two weeks ago.I love the voice recognition system.  It's proven quite accurate with text messaging, for example - just don't have any background noise, but that stands to reason.After not being able to get the speakerphone to work, it's now working great.The back camera is outstanding (haven't really checked out the lower resolution front camera), and video with voice is quite acceptable.  I also tried out the 360º panorama feature on the camera.  Even at close range (they recommend more than 30' from you to whatever's around you) I was able to get a rather acceptable image of a room in our house.  And it's quite easy to adjust white balance or image brightness before ever taking a photo.Settings are much easier to follow than with my previous LG phone (an Optimus T).  I've been able to find a number of things much easier than was ever the case with the previous phone - layout is more logical and self-explanatory.Importing and exporting files is quite easy using my Window$ computer.The phone is very easy to use, fairly intuitive, and turned out to be far less of a chore to learn a new phone than I expected.And finally, I have no issues with speed.  Despite not being LTE capable, the system used by this phone with T-Mobile is light speed compared to what I ever got with my previous LG phone.  If you MUST have speed, spend more money.  But if you are comfortable with decent, very acceptable speed, why spend the money?Overall, if you can still find one through Google at $249, GRAB IT!  And even at the somewhat higher prices on Amazon, it's a nice phone with a lower price than some with far fewer features.  Whatever happened with the system reset was magic.  I'm keeping the phone.  It's a rather strong 4-star rating in my opinion - nearly five, especially considering the direct Google price (reportedly now sold out).  I'm just hoping the Nexus 5 doesn't come out next month at a low intro price - hah hah.CONS: It seems a fair number of people have broken these in the first days of owning theirs.  With glass both front and back, that's a risk.  I got a wallet-style case, and am very happy with it.  Even if I drop the phone, I've got a fair likelihood of the phone coming through intact.  Just be careful (like so many other phones these days).                    I bought mine on google play cause it was cheaper that way.  Before this I had a Samsung Exhibit 2 because it was 4g, which is really 3g plus or HSPA+, and through t-mobile I could get the plan where 30$ a month you get 5gb of HSPA+, unlimited text, but only 100mins of talk time.  I already used skype as a phone at home so I figured I would just use skype on my smart phone since I had 5gb of data.  This worked great for a while but the Exhibit 2 only had 512mb of ram to begin with and because of the OS or whatever only 300mb was actually usable and since I pretty much always need to run skype the phone got real slow and would shut down apps a lot and became frustrating to use.So I needed a new phone but wanted it to use the same plan I had before meaning it had to be unlocked and take a t-mobile sim card.  The Nexus 4 comes unlocked and had 2gb of ram so I knew it would be able to run skype and other apps at the same time without jamming up or slowing down.  It also cost half the price of many other phones with similar specs, if you buy them without a contract.When I got my Nexus I did have to cut my t-mobile sim card so that it would match the size of the newer smaller sims. I was nervous about doing this but I have amazon prime so I bought a sim cutter off amazon they sell them for under 5$ and the come with adapter so if you want to put the sim back in your old phone you can. Anyway this worked fine I used the sim cutter turned it to a microsim put it in the Nexus and presto my phone was running didn't have to call anyone and change my plan or anything.  I feel like its important to say that cause I went with my girlfriend to a t-mobile store and the swear up and down you can just switch sims like that even if the phones unlocked.Using the phone:CONS I've had it for a while now over 6 months and I love it but its not perfect.  First I would buy a good case mine has a soft rubber thing that goes around the phone then a hard plastic shell and it works great, knocked off the table last night and didn't hurt it at all.  But without a case it seems fragile cause its all glass.  Other cons are the memory I am use to having expandable memory and I like to store a lot of music, podcast, and take lots of pics and video at highest res I can.  So for me even 16gb isn't enough and I have to always watch what I'm downloading and go through and delete but this isn't as big of a deal for a lot of people. The battery doesn't last as long as I wish but that is because I love the phone so much I use it a lot more than I have any other phone I've ever owned.  Last is I have trouble with connecting to HSPA+ and sometimes the data says its connected to the high speed but is moving very slow and what I have to do is go into settings click connect to 2g data only wait a min then unclick it and that fixes the problem.  Oh and the speaker is a little too soft for me but that is minor.PROS2gb ram is amazing I can run any apps I want no problem they run fast and smooth.  The camera, now I am not a camera person and I am sure that for real photo fans this isn't the camera you would want to use, I love the camera.  This summer I have really discovered how great it is from taking pics of my son on trips and for my untrained eye the pics have turned out wonderful and video too.  I love how you can take pics while video taping something.  The zoom isn't a real zoom and is just enlarging the pic and lowering the quality of the picture so I wouldn't recommend zooming much but everything else about the camera is great.  The screen looks great and while the phone is a little big I love having a big screen because of the battery I try to keep the brightness down or on auto but it looks great as good as an iphone imo.  There are a million other things but the last thing I will put down for a pro is it is a official google phone which to me is like having the iphone for apple only apple doesn't let anyone else make iphone compatible smartphones.  And since it is the official google phones you get perks the main one being it is always updated first so you are always on the latest android os and everything that google makes is made to work for nexus products.OVERALLI really believe that pound for pound dollar for dollar this phone is unmatched and that while this phone doesn't have every bell and whistle that the top tier phones have its strengths far out weigh its weaknesses. I really don't think I would get anything more out of the newest iphone or galaxy except the LTE and since I rarely watch videos over 2mins long on my phone I don't think would add much to my experience.  Most of my family uses iphone and while I don't know what they paid upfront but I know their monthly bill is over 100$, I pay 30$ monthly and 350$ to get the phone so even if they got their phones for free at the end of the year they will have spent 1200 to my 710 and I almost certainly, being a bit of a nerd, use and get more out of my phone than they do.  So to me its a no brainier.                    Amazing phone, perfect screen size and with decent battery life (I'm getting 4:30 hours of screen time a day - with heavy news reading, using GPS for about an hour and little games). Great price for what you are getting. Would recommend to anyone.                    I recently decided to upgrade to a Nexus 4 from a Galaxy Nexus. I love the stock Android experience but was hesitant because the Nexus 4 only seemed like a small upgrade. While the changes are not mind-blowing, a lot of small things have been improved to deliver a better experience. I've been using the phone for a couple of weeks and here are my impressions so far:Pros:-It's a Nexus device! Vanilla Android w/ no bloatware is wonderful.-Unlocked for international travel.-Very fast/responsive. The processor and 2GB of RAM make for a speedy device.-Comfortable to hold/use.-Screen is crisp and bright. Sunlight visibility is greatly improved from the Galaxy Nexus.-I like the slightly wider screen resolution for viewing websites/documents.-Call quality for me w/ T-Mobile has been fantastic and the earpiece is loud and clear.-The back pattern is unique. Whether you love it or hate it, you can't deny that it is unique.-Wireless charging is a neat feature. I recommend the LG WCP-300 wireless charger.-Noise cancellation seems to work well.-The notification light a nice feature. Try the LightFlow app for maximum customization.-The price.Cons:-No expandable storage.-No USB OTG support.-Glass back is slippery. Installing a "screen" protector will help tremendously.-Glass back looks pretty but based on user accounts is fragile and can crack easily.-Some very minor build issues such as the phone creaking when pressure is applied. Tightening the screws helps temporarily.-No LTE. Maybe this helps keep costs down?Notes/Observations:-Battery life is pretty average based on my experience and that seems to be the general user consensus.-Screen is a little washed out but the color temp seems pretty spot on. You forget about it and only realize when you see it next to something like the HTC One.-Vibration is not very strong. It is hard to hear/feel on surfaces like desks or nightstands.-Speaker is loud but sounds only average. It can sound tinny and harsh at times.-Wi-Fi and cell reception is average based on my experience.-The camera is fine but nothing to write home about. It's fine for the occasional snapshot but don't expect great quality. The same goes for video as well.When it comes down to it, the Nexus 4 is great because it offers the ability to run vanilla Android on an almost top-tier phone for a fantastic price. Sure, the phone has its faults just like every other phone but for me it performs wonderfully.If you are sick of carrier bloatware, manufacturer skins, device upgrades every two years, and locked phones then check out the Nexus 4. It really is a great phone for the price!                    My wife and I had 2 HTC 1X phones. She had the 1x and I had the One X plus. Although the screens on both of those phones were amazing and on my phone I personally loved the 64GB, they had quite a few quirks that really annoyed both of us. it was so bad we had to exchange both phones and that did not fix the issues. On both phones we would sometimes be in the middle of a call and it would suddenly just reboot and both would always say no sim card found and we have to restart the phone. That continued even with the second set of phones. I was thinking what are the chances that both phones would do this. Also we use Gmail to save all of our contacts and for some reason HTC decided that the default contacts save would be in the phone itself so we would have to continually choose to save it into Google contacts and there is no way to set it to default save to Gmail. This was annoying because in our line of work we both constantly have new clients and we try to save their phone numbers and I like having the phone numbers available across all my Google devices, not just on my phone only. My wife would especially forget to sometimes save it into Google so when we switched phones she noticed that she was missing several contacts and AT&T had so much system bloatware on both of the phones that when we disabled quite a few of them it probably made the phone act crazy as well. Even when you turned both of the phones at initial setup, the phone was practically begging you to save all the contacts into AT&T which would be the stupidest thing in the world to since they would only be available on your AT&T account. I have noticed that more and more Android phones are trying to get you to get away from Google services even though its Android. Now I understand why iPhone is the way it is. Anyways, Snce we use both of our phones for business, I had no choice but to try something different. We tried the Galaxy S phone and I did not like that TouchWiz at all, it also had little things that wanted to separate you from Google, plus the screen did not look as nice as the HTC One. Anyways now we have the Nexus 4 and it is hands down the smoothest version of Android we have ever seen or used. the screen looks just as we as fantastic as the one x plus, I thought I would not like the fact that it does not have true 4G but I haven't noticed a real difference at all for what we use it for. It really should be the number one phone, but I'm sure that's Google not properly advertising it the way Samsung advertises their phones, so unfortunately most people will never get to experience a phone that truly rivals the iPhone in overall satisfaction. After several months of use, we pretty much have had zero issues with the phones, everything works and there's absolutely no unnecessary b)apps on the phone. I would pretty much have to say we are probably going to use Nexus branded devices from now on as long as they work as smooth as these phones are right now. Liked it so much  we even got Nexus tablets. The only thing I wish personally for me is I wish I had at least 32gb because on the HTC One X plus I had 64 and I used about 27 gigabytes of it. I love media and I love apps. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a truly great working phone that pretty much does everything you need to do without all the extra gimmicks or loaded with things that you'll probably never use. Awesome phone!                    This phone, compared to my last phone (Sidekick 4G) is like the most amazing phone ever.  It has some weird color saturation in the display, but honestly I am not picky about it and is not an issue to me. The display still looks super good.  Before I bought it I saw online that all these people were complaining about the camera... well obviously its not gonna take pictures that a 1,000 dollar camera is gonna take. But for a cell phone.. the pictures are good enough for me! It runs extremely fast, loads games and any apps very fast, and can have multiple apps running (ive had 20 running at once).I guess the only slight downfall I can think of really is the battery, the battery is kinda so-so.  If you use it a full day with moderate texting and light gaming or facebook you will probably get between 12-16 hours of use, or 3-4 hours of screen on time.The itself is build pretty well I would say.  I mean yea if you are dropping it on concrete all the time... don't expect it to last very long.  But I just got a thin case for it and it is just fine.  The speaker is also pretty descent, not amazing but does the purpose fine in my estimate. The buttons on it compared to some phones I have used and seen, are very good. Don't seem like they will wear out very soon.I must point out that amazon and ebay and all these online stores are charging WAY to much.  You can get the 16GB model on google play store for 350, and the 8GB for 300.  sooo why pay over 400 for the same phone.... Get a nice case or accessories with the saved money! (: I highly recommend this phone!                    This is my first Android phone. It is really great. Responsive and smooth. The price is ok. It would be nice if it comes with SD card slot.                    Yes, this particular seller is over-priced, since this same exact phone can be purchased directly from Google Play store for $349 plus about $12 for 2-day shipping and your state's local sales tax.Even though the play store says ships in 1 to 2 weeks, the last 2 16GB Nexus 4 I ordered shipped within 12 hours of ordering.  The Nexus 4 8GB I ordered which said ships in 3 to 4 weeks, shipped in 6 days.  (Nexus 4 8GB now says 1 to 2 weeks, not 3 to 4, so I suspect shipping would be far less.  Apparently Google would rather deliver far faster than the "expected" date, rather than risk disappointing a customer by shipping later than they would expect.Even though it was 2 day shipping, all 3 Nexus 4 phones I've ordered so far have arrived the next day after shipping, but that's more because of my location (North Carolina) and UPS doing a good job.For me, the only phones I'd consider purchasing are the Nexus series for a few reasons.1. Timely updates. You will always have the latest version of Android (unless you are on a CDMA network like Verizon which can take MONTHS to issue updates to their phones, even Nexus models.)2. Pure Android experience. No over-lays or extra fluff installed on the phone taking up CPU, Battery, Memory or storage space.3. Ability to root the device easily in case you want to experiment with an alternative ROM. (Rooting may, in some cases, void your phone's warranty, but unless you completely destroy the phone into a non-functioning door stop by dropping it in water or running over it, you can always un-root the phone before requesting warranty service.Yes, I'm a little worried that this phone is manufactured by LG, but I'm hoping that it was produced to stringent Google specs and will be as reliable as my original OG Droid and my Galaxy Nexus.Advantages over Galaxy Nexus (Verizion)This phone is FAST, even running stock android vs a custom ROM on my Galaxy Nexus, this phone is very speedy. I hadn't really noticed the Galaxy Nexus feeling slow, but it does now after using the Nexus 4 for a few days."Feels" more solidGoogle Wallet is fully supported.Batter life is well over double what the battery life of the Galaxy Nexus is on 4G LTE.Brings us to the disadvantages:Batter is NOT user replaceable.Personally, I think the Galaxy Nexus with it's AMOLED display has a slight advantage in contrast and color saturation.Over-all, I'm very happy with the Nexus 4 and can highly recommend it.
!###Brisk processor (although I'm not a gamer).  Phone reception in our home is spotty even though we have a t-mobile extender.  No sound through headphone jack when charging (hopeful an Android update will fix this.).  Ringke SLIM case and RND dock both work well with this phone.                    Good quality, very god price. i enjoy using it!If your'e looking for a smartphone, that is not an iphone - this might be the one for you.                    I've been using my Nexus 4 for over 6 months now, and I can only say good things about it.The stock Android OS runs flawlessly and is buttery smooth, no lag whatsoever and it's what every Android phone should be like.The 8MP camera is good, nothing spectacular but offers good quality pictures under good conditions.Front camera is what it is.The build quality is premium, front and back glass. I've been using my phone without a bumper for about 2 months and it hasn't scratched or anything.I would recommend this phone any day to anyone. I've only found 1 con, it gets hot when playing games with high-end graphics.                    Firstly I must confess that I come from a long line of Apples: iPhone 2 and 4, iPad, iPad Mini, iMac and Macbook Air, just so you have it in perspective.I bought this phone because I wanted to try the Android OS and being a big fan of Google this had to be the one, it was intended as a replacement for an iPhone 5 that I ejected because I found it second rate.The Nexus 4 is a very cool phone, very fast, very nice looking, feels very good, very easy to operate and the display is incredibly good, overall I like it very much and in some respects is better than the iOS platform in iPhone: the Widgets with info cards that you can insert in some of the screens; some applications can interact seamlessly with the Nexus, thus you can send pics to WhatsApp directly from the Camera application; and the swipe down general status display is really cool and helpful.On the other hand, some procedures seem to take more steps in Nexus that on my iPhone, I have to click around more to get some things done; my contact list is not as good as the one on my iPhone, it always seems to be inaccurate or incomplete despite the fact that I imported my iPhone address book; and my schedule is easier to keep across my devices in iCal.Regarding the hardware, the Nexus is too sleek and buttonless if you pick it up without looking its hard to tell which side is up, down, front or back so you wind up picking it in the wrong position and having to look at it; the power button and the volume button are on the sides exactly opposite to each other so often when you press one, you wind up pressing the other, specially if you are not looking, these are mayor ergonomic oversights. And what is it with the screen that makes it so difficult to read with sunglasses?!?! I have polarized sunglasses and have to take them off to read the Nexus screen.                    I love this phone. I have not had this phone long and I am still learning it's features but I absolutely love it.                    the phone is the best value for money phone available with the lumia 920its really light and thin and feels great the colour looks great in person thephotos dont really do it justice in that regards.                    Extremely fast, no bloatware, very high resolution screen and nice design.Would benefit from an easier to replace battery and more storage                    works perfectly fine.battery last long, user interface is clear and simple.not too big in my pocket, love it.clear voice and loud speaker.love it.                    Amazing smart-phone came in bran new undamaged and works perfectly. now if only I can get the bugger turned on!                    I never really thought i could get a decent phone without a contract involved until i find out about the nexus 4, i was really impressed, i bought the phone and i haven't put this thing down yet, its awesome.Really like the Android OS on it and how smooth everything i do is. Phone quality is great, it is fragile so you will need a case because both sides are glass. I have a video of the White version here on my youtube channel:http://youtu.be/TnVWq1gThzAIts a great phone and i would recommend it to everyone. I told everyone about this phone but no one ever heard of it, that's kinda surprising.
!###Its a pretty good phone. The looks are really nice, although i had to buy a case because of the back glass breaking on all reviews.Im using it all day with wifi, 3G, GPS on and screen on half bright... And battery last 18-19hs. If put on 2G, wifi off, and gps off battery can last up to 30hs in my case..Screen response is really nice and smooth.. Software on the other hand, there are a bunch of apps using up all bandwith.. really expensive on mobile internet plan.. G+ uses A LOT on backstage.. i had to manually disable 3G traffic app by app.But for that price, its pretty much unbeatable.                    I like OSX and love iPad but i my smartphone is an Android. For the day i need all my apps of google: maps, plus, hangout, mail, etc. Nexus 4 is a great device for almost all people. If you are a hard user that play games and edit videos, so i think you need to test first before buy.                    It's the best phone package in my mind. The hardware is inferior to iPhone 5 but the hardware and software together coupled with early android updates and wireless charging make this the best phone on market                    Phone is awesome, it came as described. Shipping was as expected. The only problem that I have is that I did not receive a case with the phone as advertised.                    Always buy Nexus phones if you want the latest version of Android. This phone was a no brainer.There are few people out there that use their smart phones to it's fullest potential. If you're one of those, this phone is great.Of course the cons are...-no Micro SD slot (but everything is going to the cloud, so no need for large storage anymore)-no removable battery (not exactly, but you can still make easy repairs to this phone)-Glass backing (we know why the iPhone 4 and 4s sucked)Those are my only gripes about this phone. It is an AWESOME phone.BUY IT FROM THE GOOGLE PLAY STORE! I don't know why anyone would buy it from here?                    I was looking and reading reviews about some cellphones that cost a little more...Procesor and Memory RAM: CPU Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro y 2 gb de ram: has more ram that cellphones more expensive, and compared with others, this procesor is very fast, the best for the money.Battery: 2100 mAH: very good it last like a day, but im going to be traveling so i bought an usb charguer...OS: this cellphone has the google support, so if there comes an update... you will have it immediately.The only thing i dont like is that it hasnt micro sd slot... please google make it 32 gb internal memory if you are not going to put micro sd slot...Really i was thinking and comparing nexus with other lg cellphone that cost 300$, but i gave the chance to nexus 4... i am just waiting to turn on my cellphone!!Update 23/06/2013 *************************reading a little about nexus 4, i found nexus 4 doesnt have OTG... you cant conect a pendrive with an usb adapter to your cellphone... no google, no micro sd, no OTG??? oh my god, i will change my cellphone to samsung galaxy s3 if you dont fix this issue...i was thinking mmm 16 gb? no microsd, ok i will carry a pendrive, but no OTG...                    This is my first Smarphone and it does everything I need the way I want.5 stars cause because it's a great phone and a cheap one.                    Excellent device. Clean design with a very modern look.I am very pleased with this device.Just missed the headset.                    The phone is excellent all around.  The software on this phone is a better experience than any phone out.  You always have the latest version of android and stock android with out any added bloatware.  I also love the soft keys which for some reason so many companies don't use with android.  If I would have any complaints it would be battery life, it could be a little better.  But I am a heavy user.                    Great UI, simple to use, fantastic build quality, all in all Nexus 4 is a winner. have been using a blackberry for the last couple of years, nexus 4 beats it hands down in terms of experience
!###I recommended this device to users who love android software.i wish next time google cooperate with apple for their new phone.it is more than a phone.                    Well, this will be short but not so sweet.  Having owned the original Nexus One since the week of it's release, I sort of expected better durability with the Nexus 4. Granted, the One was made by HTC and the four by LG but still, somehow my Nexus One has survived tremendous abuse over the past three years while I was pretty careful with the shiny new Nexus 4.  Perhaps the problem is the over hyped Gorilla glass.  The Nexus One does not have it but the other phones that have had a version of it - my wifes HTC Sensation and this Nexus 4 - both ended up with cracked screens.  With the Nexus 4, I actually noticed fairly quickly that the screen scratched much easier than the original Nexus One in normal use.  Finally today though, somehow the screen cracked, leaving the touch interface inoperable.  I'm pretty careful with phones - not a single failure in over a decade with any other phone - so I was pretty shocked that my Nexus 4 screen cracked. I guess I will avoid phones with Gorilla Glass going forward given this experience and that of my wife with her HTC Sensation.Otherwise, the phone was alright. Definitely a bit slippery to handle, not terribly ergonomic in use but fast hardware.  It does tend to heat up quickly when doing simple things like surfacing the net.                    I got it on time but it came broken, it had a problem with the internal storage that made me factory reset it 3 times in 5 days. I had to give it back and I didn't have time to pick up another one. I really wanted this product.                    My order for the Nexus 4 shipped around Christmas (from the Google Play Store). It worked fine initially - however, after about a couple months, the rear glass cracked in half - on it's own! No physical contact. No drop. It just had a single crack through it. I couldn't believe it. I was really disappointed however I continued to use it since it was just a cosmetic issue at the time.Another couple months passed and then - you guessed it - the front glass cracked in half, the same way that the back did - again, by itself! Took it out of my pocket and it had a single giant crack through the front screen. There was no physical force on it, no drop. nothing. Not only that, but the touch does not even function anymore, so I can't use it at all - I can't retrieve my files off of it, I can't download my photos, and I couldn't even shut it off!As if that weren't bad enough, to add insult to injury, I found out that Google did not cover it since it was too far from the purchase date, and LG, who provides the hardware warranty - informed me when I called that I would have to pay for the repairs (which I read online range from $100-$250), even though it was the result of normal use, and I made it clear it was so!I would strongly suggest saving your money and purchasing a different phone - that doesn't self destruct!Update:The cost for repairs was $153 and a replacement unit was shipped to me. The total period of this took 2-3 weeks.                    I was excited to finally receive my Nexus 4 and WAS considering the Nexus 4. After receiving I thought the phone was great except one flaw. The case is very slippery because it is made with glass. I had used a case but that prevented the proximity sensor from working. I discovered that my case was cracked after setting it on a countertop. LG will gladly replace the cover for $65 but why should I pay for something that is a product flaw. Google offers no support or replacement options.                    I'll admit, I'm an Apple fanboy and have always had iPhone as my main phone with a few androids along the way. The phone is good and works but I just can't handle how it's such a hassle owning a Mac and having to use this phone. The Apple ecosystem is much better for me personally.However, if you are wanting a great, modern phone and aren't worried about app 'eye candy' and ease of use in a phone, then this is a good phone. It has been serving me well but I will be bing the new iPhone when it comes out in September as I just can't adapt to android.                    There's no arguing the list of capabilities of the device, it's indisputable.  However it's the way an Android device goes about it that makes me want to return it. And make no mistake, this is the best, most elegant Android device out there. And I even am not complaining about the touch-only typing, which is great &#8211; as is the swipe-to-type feature. Amazing.&#8226; very hard to use quickly. too much stop-and-think required to navigate the UI&#8226; very hard to use one-handed&#8226; beautiful but redundant & confusing UI paths&#8226; weird email behaviors and synching&#8226; NO UNIVERSAL SEARCH!?!? really? (BB Bold or webOS device, turn it on, type, FOUND IT)&#8226; apps and esp. email often lags, hangs when only 3G available&#8226; too many taps to make calendar additions or edits. too many taps in general to do things&#8226; cannot get used to the copy cut paste functions of a touch-only device.  awkward&#8226; I was excited for the Orb Qi wireless charging dock but it gets so many bad reviews. Coming from the webOS Touchstone which was wonderful, this is a letdown&#8226; on the whole, just too much phone, too much going on, too much ...everything.In short, I'm old(er)-fashioned. I like the directness, simplicity, and buttons of a BB Bold 9900 or a WebOS Pre 3.                    It was quick and polite and arrived until discount and was the best. In addition, I want to order it.                    Great fast phone, but it is a hundred $$$ over priced. The phone is smooth but the battery drains fast.                    Too expensive. Half price if you buy straight from Google . This seller is stupid. I just bought the 16gb from Google themselves for a little over 300. To say this is originally more is bad businessGreat phone bad priceThis phone is amazing. Even though it lacks an sd card it has wireless charging a quad Core a day a must have curved screen. Google is sold out so buy it on Amazon for sure but nor from this idiot
!###I loved, its really awesome. The Camera is very nive, its very fast, and Everything was fine in the transaction                    The phone surpassed all my expectations. It is lightning fast, the screen is gorgeous, and the build quality has a premium sensation, different from the others from Samsung or HTC.                    This phone is over price, if you wish to buy it get it from the google website which is more secure and you get the same phone for better price.                    I bought this phone over 4 months ago and I should say I'm disappointed with many things thisphone has to offer. Here are some BIG ones from my perspective:1. The only option I had for cell provider (in April) was T-mobile. T Mobilecoverage is not good where I lived although the coverage map shows excellentaccess. I live &lt;10 miles from Boston downtown, so...2. The Battery life is poor. We see it draining pretty quickly after 3-4 hrsof use.3. The promise of the cool 360 view Camera was one of the reasons we boughtthis phone, but this is a BAD camera. Even simple straightforward picturesshow serious artifacts.All in the all, I would not recommend this phone to anyone. i bought intothe hype, my recommendation is please don't. There are better phones out there!                    The so-called gorilla glass is very fragile. A light tap against the arm of my chair caused it to shatter. I replaced the screen for $170 and the same thing happened on the first day. The Nexus4 may be the greatest phone ever made. If so, it is all wasted becuase of one cheap component.                    Back screen crack within 3 weeks, no drop! Defective product! & Terrible Service!I stil cannot believe why some people choose "not helpful" for the review of unreasonable back crack. It's the truth. Only what I can believe is either Nexus/GOOGLE fun or GOOGLE/LG hire somebody to click "no" for it.A week ago I see a crack on the back of the screen. It's only 3 weeks after I received the product.I used the phone for 3 weeks with no drop on the floor. I'm a kind of person always taking care of my personal stuff so well. So I believe the phone is under my control.Then I did some research and find a lot of similar problems happened. There has been some conclusion that it is caused by temperature. So technically, it should be a design problem, which I believe that it is defective product issue.Then I contact GOOGLE and learn 2 things:1. Google only has 15 days policy to return the product.2. Google will charge 15% restocking fee if we return the product.What a big company! What a terrible return service policy they have! Especially comparing Amazon!Then I told them the problem about the crack, they said they are not responsible for the "damage", I should contact LG for repair.After I contact LG, the customer service is terrible. The first one said they don't have this kind of problem, and he said that it is physical damage and not apply to the warranty, and need me to send it to LG to do examination, and need two weeks to get the phone.1. I need to pay the shipping fee.2. Wait for 2 weeks.3. Probably I need to pay repair fee because they have made decision that it doesn't apply to the warranty.4. I told him about the defective problem caused by temperature, he told me he's never heard about that and all customers called about the cracks are because they drop the phone. The truth is I've never dropped the phone after I got it, and there has been some news can be searched online by GOOGLE! How happened it has been in some news!Conclusion:1. Terrible services by two big companies throw the ball with each other. The customers are the loser finally.2. I still believe the CSR in LG is lying.3. I won't believe Google can do anything anymore. I probably like CSR in LG better because they are straight, not like Google's CSR, kindly saying a lot of words, but no help.4. Terrible Google return policy. 15 days return with 15% restocking fee. Do you want to extend your retail business as an small ebay seller?DON `T RECOMMEND google Nexus or LG phone.If nothing happened, it's functional. If something happened, you will see their terrible policy and service.See the link below for more related case.[...]                    After owning a Nexus 4 for ten months. A G2 for a year, MyTouch 4G six months before that, and the G1 the day it came out I've had enough. It appears that the manufactures of Android devices and even Google branded devices all will forever have the same core problems.1.) Total lack of call and audio quality. On and off speakerphone as well as plugged in headphones.2.) Intolerable charging issues. Micro HDMI has broken or stopped charging on four devices now. The wireless charger for nexus 4 was worthless.3.) A complete lack of a support4.) The 6-12 month lifespan of the hardware.Also I've owned a Nook and a Galaxy Tab (Nook: Wouldn't charge after 6 months, Galaxy Tab: under powered).In the five years I've purchased 6 android devices most my iPhone friends have owned 2 or 3. I've never dropped a single one of these devices and I've paid for cases and screen shields and they still break. I've also probably spent 15% of the last five years owning a problematic phone before I buy the next.I sincerely hope you get your act together and start making devices worth buying. After going over all this I doubt my own sense of reason that it took me this long to realize how much time and money I've wasted.-Josh                    I bought this phone after having a tough time getting a decent price for a Samsung S4. I bought the phone because it had a #Google name. This phone is by far the worst I have owned. I would suggest you search "nexus 4 slow internet connection" on your favorite search engine. See how many other people have the same issue. Secondly, the screen freezes often. Good luck trying to locate your destination when you are on the way, and the screen freezes. During meetings I always set the ringer to silent (it's a reflex). Well, the phone will intermittently set ringer volume to max volume. This has happened often enough to the point I have to turn off the phone. I only give this a 1 star, because I can't give it a -1 star !!!                    The back glass is broken around the speaker, after I use it less than one month. It is never dropped, or knocked. I just put it in the back bag... When I took it out, it is broken.The customer service is also terrible. I would never buy LG product.                    Haven't checked but expect it's good in the package.Will open the package soon and let you know if anything i smissing.
!###I love this phone. LG has neither good nor bad image to me, but this phone showed their potential to be great.The phone runs fast as expected(Project Butter helps a lot too). I has 10-20 apps open at any given time and I noticed no lag. The support for HSDPA+ 42 network shows off really great. I get 10-12 Mbps down and 1-3 Mbps up in Seattle area(though the phone will indicate 3G every now and then but it seems the phone is still on H because I got about the same speed).Now there are few flaws.1. Storage. 16Gb is still not enough for me. I filled my phone up after 4 days(no joke). So if anything get 16GB its worth the extra 50 bucks.2. CPU power throttling. In order to make great use of the average size 2200mAh battery Google/LG has put in a throttling system where if the Battery is certain temperature the CPU speed is clocked down to lower speed. I am not that much of a power user so I haven't seen great drop in performance(the throttling start at 36F). But for any intense gamers this isn't the phone to get.People like to complaint about the non-removable battery, but the phone is actually easy to open up when you need to replace the battery(Go look at the full tear down on YouTube Channel l355on5).Also there is no support for LTE. So the phone isn't exactly flag-ship material as Google would like to make it out as. Despite the lack of LTE support, for users looking to go pre-paid this phone will do great.I would also like to remind you that this phone will stay relevant for longer than average phone(with exception to iPhones, and Galaxy S3 and Note 2). As a Nexus Google will be the one to send out updates to your phone for Pure Android experience which I found to be just fantastic. iPhone and GS3 is 600 at best unlocked for 16 GB. So go for this phone you wont regret it.This phone is a steal for 350 on Google Play. Pricing here is bit high for some reason so head over to Google Play store. (After Tax and shipping added up to about $400). But I would buy cases on here because the Offical Bumper for Nexus 4 is out and God knows when those will be back on store                    Hello there!  So I'm assuming you want to know about the Nexus 4, no?  For this review, I'm going to be breaking it down into segments for easier reading.  So, have at it!  PS- I bought this phone though Google itself, so I based the pricing on that since it's the only official way to get it for now.  They're way more expensive here on Amazon for the time being.Look:  The phone is HUGE.  It isn't thick or heavy, but due to the large screen size, the thing is wide and tall.  It is almost all black except for the silver bezel, which is a much welcome addition (it would look very boring without it).  The back has a very fancy patterned glass which looks vaguely like a disco ball when there is a strong light present.  It doesn't come on too strong, though, so don't worry about it being too flashy.  There is a large "Nexus" logo on the back, and the camera is in the top left corner just above the N.  There are a total of three buttons on the side- a power button on the right and volume buttons on the left; Simple and easy to remember.  Overall, it's kind of boring for a design, but there's enough zest to make it fun to look at.Internals:  It's all over the internet, but there's a quad core processor, 2 GB of RAM, a 8 Megapixel main camera and a 4.7 inch HD screen.  also, on the front, there's a video chat camera.  What all of this adds up to is a high end Android phone as of late 2012/early 2013.  There's not too much that you really could be asking for, since this will let you do anything you could possibly ever want it to.Android:  Out of the box, it comes with basic android 4.2.  It's a great operating system that all other manufacturers seem to love building upon.  It works just like any other android phone you may have had, but it works more smoothly and has a few more features than before.  There's lock screen widgets, for example, which lets you view information without unlocking your phone (don't worry- you don't have to use any of them if you are weary of strangers seeing your inboxes).  Everything is very robotic and cold-toned.  It looks very cool, although it will take a little bit of time to get used to some changes from older versions.Battery and Storage:  the battery is 2100 MaH, which is unremovable.  Luckily, though, the battery is strong enough to last you at least a day.  Myself, I make sure to not have anything I'm not using on (such as wifi, GPS, apps, that sort of thing), and I can get 2 days of use.  Not spectacular compared to a feature phone, but not horrible by any means for a smart phone.  16 GB of storage for this phone turns out to be 12 GB once they've loaded the operating system on it.  This is for you to decide whether it is enough, but I find that I have over 10 GB left, even with all of my apps and photos on it.  If you are going to have music, maybe not.Camera:  The cameras seem to be where LG and Google cut the price of the phone.  The interface for the camera is elegant and very easy to use, which makes it all the worse that the camera is so... average.  It isn't horrible, but you are definitely going to want to bring a stand alone camera with you when you go on a trip or to a family party.  It will work for spur of the moment photos, of course, and if you don't want to carry around another camera, you could surely do worse.The front camera isn't too great, and it was really only meant for video chats.  It has no auto focus, which means everything will be grainy and fuzzy-looking.All-in-All:  It's a great phone, period.  For the price, it's AMAZING.  In the US, it's $350 without a contract, which is a few buck higher than a similar phone on a major carrier.  It definitely is worth trying out.                    Before I actually write the review, I want to let fellow shoppers know that this phone is available on the Google Play website at MSRP which is $349.99+tax+shipping, which might save some people a bit of money if you can wait. Also note the phone tends to ship faster than Google's site indicates.Also, ALL NEXUS 4 Phones are UNLOCKED by default. Don't pay more to someone trying to make that a selling point to sell for higher than MSRP!With that said, I had a iphone 4s before I bought the nexus. It takes a bit of getting used to in transitioning to the Nexus but overall, the Nexus is a solid contender with a sleek design and a more versatile o/s. The iphone is much simpler than the Nexus in function, things are much more logical, and what I mean is you can give it to your grandparents and they can intuitively figure it out for the most part. The Nexus while simple, has much more functionality and wouldn't be something your grandparents could master as fast as an iphone. However, do note that my grandparents loved the Nexus once they figured out how to use it but they did miss Siri quite a bit. The key difference is this phone is noticeably faster when you swap apps and has a much clearer and larger screen. The battery life has so far been better than my iphone 4s by a noticeable factor. The rest of this review will be a summary of pro's and con's for simplicity, since we all hate to read walls of text. =)Pro:+Gorgeous screen with excellent colors+Battery Life is excellent (Your mileage may vary based on what you use)+Camera is excellent (both front and back cameras, but iPhone still takes better pictures especially in dark light)+Huge app library for Android+Unlocked - worked great in UK on UK SIM+No Contract purchased at MSRP+Cheap compared to iphone and other smartphones+Fast processor / loads apps faster than iphone did+Voice Clarity was excellent+Volume on speakerphone was louder than on iphone 4s (your milage may vary as some users report differently)+NFC technology enabled+Google Now - aims to help you thru your day with predictive cards (still in infancy but somewhat useful and has great potential)+Wireless charger (sold separately)Cons:-Viewing angle of screen - some distortion if you view the phone screen at extreme angles-User Interface is not as intuitive as that on iphone if simplicity is what you seek-divorced from Siri (well, only if you used her on iphone)-No SD card expansion slots-No LTE-Slightly larger size-Even though camera is excellent, it is not on par with pictures taken on an iphone                    Quality product at excellent price - Excellent Android cell phone - Google Jelly Bean 4.2 at its finest - 4.2 updates do make using the cell phone that much easier.  Electronic only documentation for phone except for quick start guide.  For me the 16 GB of Flash Memory on-board on the board is not a limitation - that good for alot of music and magazine downloads - probably can store several full length videos as well as your music and magazines for trips without problem.  Too bad Google placed so low orders with LG for the phone that you have to buy it elsewhere than Google Play store although it is now reappearing for order there now (End of January).Only Issue i seen sometimes is in phone calls the screen does not properly stay/wake out of sleep mode during initial phone calling like to voice mail.  Get a good screen protector as well.                    I looked & looked to review the T-Mobile version here on amazon, but could only find the Unlocked version to review. So with that in mind, lets get started:Let me start off by admitting up front, based on my brief stint working for AT&T, I was NOT a fan of LG phones. Not in the slightest. In fact, some of the worst phones I've EVER seen were LG models (however, in the spirit of honesty, I can't comment on LG models sold on the Verizon or Sprint networks). I have always wanted the Pure Google Experience, but for one reason or another, the opportunity never really presented itself...until Verizon lied to me about keeping my unlimited data plans, took it away from me, and oh yeah, the fact that they charge OUTRAGEOUS sums for their service, well, it bugged me once too often and I jumped ship.I used to believe that once you've had LTE service, you'd never go back...that is until I had the AT&T Galaxy Note, and where I live, we are blanketed with their low-tier 4G service, and no LTE. Verizon literally covers almost my whole state with LTE service, however. The difference between that low-tier 4G & LTE--at least as far as how I use the internet, was rather minimal, or at least not so significant that it bothered me. Now yIn my area, T-Mobile happens to cover the area rather sporadically with their HSPA+ service, which they bill as ALMOST LTE download speeds, which is pretty good--IF you can get the service. Unfortunately, the 4G is SO spotty, that taking just ONE step in any particular direction can mean the difference between full 4 bars of 4G and NO 4G whatsoever. A rather large portion of my town has ZERO HSPA+ service...something I did not know until after I joined up with T-Mobile. Oh well.I did a great deal of research about the Nexus 4 (unlike the poor reasearch I did about coverage...) before making my decision, and after all is said and done, I am VERY impressed with the phone. At first I thought something was wrong when I went into the app drawer, but it dawned on my quickly that because its Pure Google, I don't have to be weighed down by all the TONS of bloatware that ALL carriers dump into their phones. Color me very happy indeed. The phone itself is very nice, feels great in my hands--however, the rather large b-u-u-u-t that accompanies that statement revolves around the fact that next to the iPhone 4 and 4S (the two most easily shattered phones ever designed in history), the Nexus 4 is remarkably easy to break as well, considering how much glass its packed inside of. I hear that even the Gorilla Glass 2 front is prone to breaking as well. No matter how you slice it, you simply MUST purchas a case to protect this investment or the inevitable WILL happen, it always does.Performance...? Awesome. Flawless, to be exact. Everything is crisp and QUICK. Thanks to the quad-core processor, things fly at lightning speed and I have yet to see any kind of hiccup...which is very nice. The scrolling with Jelly Bean is fluid and very buttery, like they said it would be. Nice to see they were right. From the lock screen's new additional widgets, to the wonderful cool options of Google Now (think iPhone's Siri only SERIOUSLY better), there is a LOT to like.One thing I do a LOT of on my phone is text...so the keyboard is critical to me. Adding its own gesture/swype-like keyboard was a nice feature, but I got to missing Swype...enough so that I went to their website and downloaded it myself (had to jump through a few hoops to actually get it to run, but it was worth it). The whole speech-to-text function has received a GIGANTIC overhaul...you'll either love it or not. Personally I think its a nice step up. I really think if you have a phone with Jellybean 4.2.2, take advantage of Google Now. If you don't you are missing out. Seriously.One other thing I REALLY like is the addition of Phonetic Spelling to contacts. The truth of the matter is this, we ALL know someone with an odd spelling to their name, or last name that speech-to-text function never seems to recognize, so this function really allows you to be creative in phoneticially spelling that name, and allowing Google Now to search it easily on your phone. It may be an easy and simple thing, but it was a VERY welcome addition if you ask me.The camera seems to have undergone a nice overhaul, too. It looks entirely different now, but not too difficult to navigate through. I haven't tried Photosphere yet, but I'm anxious to give it a shot. What I REALLY do like is the photo editing feature that makes cropping, Coloring & regular editing fairly simple and intuitive. Haven't tried to video anything yet, but I'll post my results when I do.What has bugged me was how un-impressed I am with the battery. Coming from the Droid Razr, with a rather anemic 1750 mAh battery to the Nexus and a much larger 2100 mAh battery, I truly expected a great increase in how much I could use my phone...alas, I was mistaken. I really believe that I could get about 30% more usage on my Razr than with the Nexus. Pretty disappointing considering the difference in battery size. I've also owned several smartphones over the years, and heavy internet browsing generally heats up the phone to a certain degree. Some phones suffer from this more than others, but I have to say, the virtually all-glass Nexus heats up to an uncomfortable degree, enough so that I once placed it on my knee while wearing shorts and it almost burned me. Sorry, but this is unacceptable. Maybe a change will come soon with an update, which, thankfully with Google, should come fast and regularly. Otherwise, I may take it back to see what the deal is.I really like the position of the buttons. Not bothersome like on my Razr. I HATED having the volume buttons directly under the power buttons. The number of times I pressed the up volume instead of the power key and wondered why the phone didn't turn on (or off)...well, its enough to drive you nuts after the hundredth time, trust me.I am also impressed with how thin the phone is. Just barely thicker than the Razr (which is truly the thinnest phone around) and yet overall, no bigger. Set the phones side by side and I was very happy with the fact that my screen is a full half-inch bigger, and yet the phone isn't any larger overall. Nice.The screen--while true HD, well ISN'T nearly as vibrant as I expected it to be. I may be in the minority here, but I just expected it to pop more like a Super Amoled screen does. With that being said, the screen IS beautiful, and probably renders colors more natural-like than Amoled screens do, at least I can be honest with that. I just personally prefer the over-saturated colors I got with Amoled phones. Oh well.Call quality and speaker functions were exceptional, too. Didn't drop any calls, and I was impressed with the clarity and loudness of the speaker on the back. By the way, the phone has dual mic's so you have the noise canceling function that most high-end smartphones have been including for a few years now.All things considered, I am VERY happy with the phone, other than the small complaints I registered above. Overall, I have to say this is probably the best Android phone on the market (unless you MUST have LTE)...at least for the time being. I realize that will change any moment now, but such is life in the world of advancing electronics. Look for updates soon...***UPDATE***Totally forgot to include this in my initial review: the LED light which at first I thought was absent entirely, well, it turns out that the Nexus 4 really DOES have an LED indicator light...unfortunately, it isn't a bright one, and its at the bottom of the phone (in the center) instead of at the top as per most smartphones. I don't really care where the light happens to be, just that the phone has one. The original Galaxy Note didn't have one at all, which I felt was a GIGANTIC Fail on Samsungs part, but oh well. The LED on the Nexus 4 has to be enabled in settings, as it comes out of the box disabled--which I find a bit puzzling. On top of that, mine never really seemed to work worth a darn--until I downloaded an app which allowed me to access it and therefore adjust it for how quickly it blinked and what color. Again, it seems sporadic as far as how easy it is to get the thing to properly work, but at least it does. Honestly, the fact that it doesn't work ALL the time is a fairly big Oops on LG's part. This technology is pretty standard in even ultra-cheap phones and smartphones alike, so the fact that this one only works so-so is a problem with design. I've noticed forums online which speak to this in-depth so it isn't just an isolated incident, fyi.Also, I had owned an Android-based Bluetooth keyboard which I LOVE and used regularly on both the Galaxy Note & the Droid Razr without problem, but unfortunately, will NOT work on Jellybean 4.2 and above. It'll pair no prob--but there is no way to get the keyboard to actually WORK, and trust me, I've read as much as I believe you can on the subject and still nothing. Honestly, I believe a work-around will arrive probably rather soon via an OTA update, but in the meantime, I have this nice keyboard which is on my shelf now collecting dust as it is unusable for the time being. Another big Oops if you ask me.I really like the screen's responsiveness. MUCH better than ALL previous Android devices. Even close to the very edge, where I had noticed a lack of sensitivity on all other phones I had used. Nice going, LG.The Nexus boots up from being turned totally off in a remarkably short amount of time--easily 75% faster than any other phone I've used (with the possible exception of the HTC One X, which still may be the fastest available--at least that I have personally seen). Nothing was slower than the Blackberries, but this was a nice and VERY pleasant surprise. Maybe those extra two cores help in that matter...Camera is impressive as well. Clearly better than all other models I've used, again, with the possible exception of the HTC One X, which has an absolutely STELLAR optical device. Honestly, I'm not a photographer by trade, but the Nexus 4's camera certainly seems to be the equal of the One X in pretty much all areas other than color saturation. The addition of photosphere is just brilliant. You simply have to try it. I really love this feature, even though its more novel than anything else, it IS pretty dang sweet. And I REALLY continue to love the photo editing features which come with Jellybean. Nice touch, Google. I keep wondering when we'll start to see megapixels larger than 8 become standard on these phones. 8 has been around for an eternity (as far as electronics are concerned) and I'm thinking a 10MP camera really ought to be the norm by now--but what do I know, huh?***UPDATE #2***As I stated above, I downloaded Swype simply because in my experience, it has the best function which I prefer at understanding accurately what I'm trying to write. I recently tried Swiftkey Flow (trial) and found it to be pretty much just as accurate, and I even like the customization--however, I see no reason to PAY for the full version (because I'm a cheapskate, honestly) when Swype will do what I want for FREE. With that being said, let me admit that I like to change things up quite a bit on my phone, the background, widget layout etc. and once in a while, I like to switch keyboards just to make my experience varied. I tried to go BACK to the stock Android keyboard (which really IS pretty well done), and no matter what I did, I couldn't get it enabled. I spent the better part of 2 days trying to figure out what was wrong. I hadn't deleted it, so where was it? Finally, out of sheer frustration, I kinda gave up when it hit me. I went into settings, down to apps, and searched for it and voila! There it was. I have no idea HOW or WHY, but it had been disabled. Don't get that at all. I didn't do it, but at least it was an easy fix to re-enable it. The gesture typing (as they are calling it) takes a bit to get used to since as you trace along the screen a little box follows you with the predictive text it THINKS you're trying to write. It IS correct more often than not, but I have to say, it DOES take a bit to get used to that little thing following your finger around. You can turn it off, by the way, but once you get used to it, I found it actually kinda useful. Let me say this: if Swiftkey Flow was free, I'd keep it in a heartbeat. LOVE its layout and convenience. I dare say its the best Swype-like keyboard I've seen to date. Don't be fooled, there are a bunch in the Google Play store to choose from, but while some spend a great time in making the keyboard LOOK good, they spend much less time making it accurate. I won't name names because what I dislike, YOU might actually prefer. Everyone is different, and I recommend trying it yourself before making decision...don't just take my word for it.***UPDATE #3***The longer I have this phone, the more I really like it. I cannot stress, however, how important it is to get a case to protect it. Being virtually all glass, it certainly FEELS like quality--unfortunately, it also feels rather slick. I've noticed it slipping on the counter when I placed it on top of a stack of items that was slightly at an angle. Slippage that wouldn't have happened with any other phone I've personally owned, and definitely not with a decent case protecting it.Google Now is simply awesome. I've watched several video's and read many articles comparing it with Siri, and almost all have them neck-and-neck except for a few which were ridiculously biased towards apple. They each have their own strengths over the other. If you like snarky responses, Siri is your gal. But if you want a service which will (over time, of course) recognize your schedule, commute time and other things you do regularly, and offer you with simple solutions, such as knowing that you have an appointment at 5, but the busses in your area are running slow, or traffic is backed up due to an accident, Google Now will send you a reminder to leave a little extra early. Siri not only doesn't, but cannot pull this off. The honest truth is that the differences and preferences are pretty much personal, and in no way mean one is inherently better than the other. I found Siri to be a great novel idea which--after a couple months, very few people regularly used. However, Google Now (IMO) offers things to me as help even if I don't ask it to. I can choose to ignore them or heed the advice. Its up to me. Just points to ponder.I have changed my opinion on the clarity and color saturation of the screen (for the most part). I simply wasn't using a screen wallpaper which allowed the phones color to really shine. I also had the screen brightness as low as it would go. Turn it up and you'll see a world of difference.Screen responsiveness remains very good and while I've personally used Verizon's 4G LTE (as well as AT&T's) and I am VERY impressed with T-Mobile's HSPA+ speeds. I won't place it up with LTE, but I must admit (when I actually HAVE the service) that its mighty quick. With a good signal, I'd say its 85% as fast as LTE. VERY impressive, T-Mobile. Now hurry up and get those two other towers in town so I'll have a decent signal all over my small town. One other thing about T-Mobile's service in my area, its either their 4G or Edge service, no 3G at all. Talk about a MAJOR differnce. Holy COW! I may end up moving to Vegas before too long and I know my service will work great with the coverage they have down there.Google went to work on Jelly Bean with Project Butter to help with how the screen fluidly switches from one to the next, and no matter how tiny that may seem to you, the end result is pure bliss. It works...really, REALLY well. Not only do I have no complaints, but supreme kudos to Google for pulling it off and in VERY nice style. No longer can my iOS friends claim better screen transitions. In truth, this is something that Android has had to play catch-up on for far too long. It SHOULD have been worked out back when Froyo came out several years back. But at least its here and works wonderfully.Google Now just keeps getting cooler to me. It "Learns" your life and reacts accordingly the more you use your phone and the longer you have it. I have added a Google Now widget to my homescreen, and it just popped up to tell me my commute home would take a bit longer than usual due to traffic issues on the route I normally take. A few minutes later, the time was changed again as the traffic became even worse. I didn't ASK Google to give me that info, but since I allowed Google that ability in settings (you have to give it permission, otherwise Google Now is only a nifty tool, more like Siri) it just gave me that info right away. If I have appointments, it looks ahead to see if I need to leave sooner to make the appointment based on traffic, or if I take the bus it'll remind me to leave sooner based on those perameters as well. It LEARNS...Siri does not. For that alone, GN beats apple. No doubt that will change with the newest iOS update scheduled for later this year. But having a Nexus phone assures me that no matter how much iOS improves, Google will, too and I'll continue to receive the FIRST updates when they become available.Another cool feature of Jelly Bean is Smart App updates. In a nutshell, before when an app I downloaded received an update, I would have to re-download the entire app all over again from the Play Store, and within it would be the small update. Even IF the actual update was only 1mb in size, but the entire upate was 22mb's...you'd seriously use up bandwidth as well as precious data (for those not on unlimited plans). With Android 4.2 when an app needs upating, you download ONLY that part of the app which is new, therefore saving a great deal of bandwidth AND data usage. This is not only smart, but freakin' genius if you ask me. I'm kinda surprised that Google doesn't shout this from the rooftops because its a pretty big deal for those who have data limits and no regular access to WiFi like some people are fortunate to have.I've tried several different Home Screen Launchers since I got the Nexus 4 and always seem to just go back to the stock Launcher. Don't get me wrong, some of the newer apps are simply brilliant, and the 3D effects are just awesome. But truth be told, these days that just does't cut it for me. I just want my phone to WORK. The less stuff I add to it, I find it just works better. Thats just me, though. I understand that may not be for everyone. To each his own, right?One more thing: I've recently discovered the Tasker App for Android. Holy freakin' COW! The closest thing I'm aware of that is similar is something Motorola has started to add on their newer devices--but it can't do a tenth of what Tasker can do. It is TOTALLY worth the cost (and so far, the ONLY app I've ever paid for). You can set your phone to turn up the brightness when opening up Google Chrome, and it'll automatically dip down to whatever setting it was before (you have to NOT have it on Automatic Brightness for this to work, however). I've set my GPS to auto turn-on the moment I open the Maps app, and shut off as soon as I exit. It may sound less than interesting, but trust me, its amazing how helpful it can be. If I receive a phone call and I want to silence the call, I simply turn my phone face down, the ringer will automatically shut off. Now, keep in mind this app takes a bit to get used to and I doubt many will ever truly use it to its full potential (yes, it can do THAT much stuff), and I recommend looking at the YouTube instructions which will help immeasurably on how to set it up and give you an idea--it'll help more than you know.***FINAL UPDATE***After a bit of a struggle, I received and downloaded update 4.4 Kit Kat a few days ago. First off, I gotta say I'm disappointed. Not with how the phone is operating, but with what we were TOLD to expect, and with what this update actually delivers. I've watched several YouTube videos with early versions on the N4 as well as Google's official tour of what to not only expect from the N5 but the official reviews after it was initially released. A LOT was placed upon the new & improved Transparent home screen. Did that come to the N4? Nope. Also, the swipe to the left to get Google Now also wasn't included. Now why wasn't all that made clear from the absolute BEGINNING has been a real disappointment. At least we would've known instead of waiting this whole time only to find out AFTER the download instead of expecting it the way Google SHOULD have handled this debacle. And the fact that Verizon's Moto X got the update BEFORE ANY Nexus device was not only an insult, but a slap in the face, too. Yes I understand that Motorola now being owned by Google makes their products kinda, sorta Nexus-like. Yes, I know. But regardless, that doesn't make them Nexus devices. Period. Even if my phone had received it a day BEFORE they released it, I still would have been surprised, but a lot less perturbed. These are the reasons why people like me purchased the Nexus in the first place is because we were lead to believe that WE'D get those updates FIRST. Not so any longer. Also, after positioning 4.4 as for ALL--and bragging how it uses the least amount of RAM of most of the earlier versions of Android and yet NOT making it available for the Galaxy Nexus could be the biggest insult of all. It'll run on as little as 512MB of RAM and yet you won't allow the GNexus to update? WHY?? That alone makes it NOT the OS for everyone. Oh, I'm sure someone will make a modified version available for the GNexus probably soon, but the fact that it wasn't issued by Google itself is an Epic FAIL in MY opinion. Just sayin'.The icons are bigger under 4.4. Quite a bit actually. And I'm NOT a fan of that. Sure my screen is decent sized, but even with such limited real estate, I hate for too much space to be used up by simple icons which CANNOT be re-sized or moved. Some may not be bothered by this at all, but I felt it was worth mentioning all the same.For those who have the N4 and STILL want the N5-like experience without actually having to buy one, go search for the 'Google Experience Launcher' (as I write this, you cannot find it in the Play Store). It will in fact give you the transparancy home screen, the swipe to left Google Now as well as the ability to simply speak "OK Google" while on any home screen to launch Google Now. Keep in mind that by enabling this feature, because the N4 wasn't designed for this function, it WILL use a bit more juice than usual (fairly noticeable if you ask me). You can turn the feature off and retain everything else, but its worth noting all the same.Google Now is more fluid and the speech recognition seems greatly improved. Sure, some words are problematic, but that's life when using technology (and I might add aren't any easier to speak using Siri, either). I've noticed a nice improvement overall with it. VERY happy with that aspect. For me, the new phone functions are simply awesome. MUCH better than before. I'm really liking that part of Kit Kat A LOT. Still a lot to like about the N4--but the battery life is still pretty miserable. I WAS considering getting the Nexus 5 seeing as it was supposed to essentially be the G2 without all the LG bloatware and UI crap. But the battery on the G2 is massive compared to the rather anemic one they put in the N5. Maybe that was for budgetary consideration seeing as they are selling it for about the cheapest price you can purchase a first class smartphone these days. Oh well. I just may go with the N5 after all...if not that then maybe the Note 3--which I really like. I just want to see Kit Kat made available to that before I take the plunge. I just loved my first Note. Size DOES matter, and for me, it was awesome. SO hard to go back to anything else without that large screen. I miss it big time.                    I bought mine and being using it heavily for a month now.Cosmetics:The nexus 4 looks beautiful, the gorilla glass 2 in the back is just superb looking. It's slim, lightweight and you cant barely notice on your pocketconsidering it's screen size.The border is grippy, which is good, actually a very durable device from every angle, even tho you should be careful by the simple fact that it hasglass in both sides glass is glass, call it pyrex or gorilla glass nothing is unbreakable.OS:Jelly Bean 4.2.1 is amazing, such a huge improvement over older versions I consider it nowadays superior than IOS 6.To appeal every control freak out there you need to heavily tweak to your liking, for example I consider the OS mail clientrubbish. If you need a powerful mail client do yourself a favor and buy aqua mail pro app from the playstore, going now for$4.99 In my opinion google should fire the ones responsable for the native mail client and simply hire this developer.The cpu is absolutely powerful, best in class, quad core with 2gb in ram means goodness!To sumarize, Jelly Bean is amazing and CUSTOMIZABLE which you cant really do with IOS.Problems:I actually don't know if its a bug but my phone has trouble switching from wifi to wireless network from my carrier, sometimes it does sometimesI have to go into airplane mode for a second and back to carrier to obtain data signal.As you probably know there are several bugs reported such as problems with bluetooth, low volume for some alerts, weak vibration etc.Well it depends, some app notifications sound very loud but this probably has to do with native notifications.Anyway most of this stuff will be solved in next OS Update 4.2.2 expected soon.Desing flaws:The speaker is set in the back cover without any room left between the device and the contact surface, in other words if you leaveyour phone over the table facing up you will notice a huge decrease in the volume of your ringtones or notifications.May 27 2013 UPDATEWith the latest version of Jelly bean 4.2.2 all the bluetooth and switching through data network problems were solved.Really recommend this device.                    NEXUS 4 is rated 5/5.So a bunch of smart people decided to buy this phone from the Google play store for $387( includes tax) and resell it here for $600. Its an absolutely amazing phone and YES purchase it. Its probably the best smart phone(better than the iPhone 5 IMHO) but please purchase it on the play store. You're losing about $213 if you buy it from this Amazon reseller. Its a rip off so buy it from the play store!Look at the actual the price by searching nexus 4 on Google, you'll see a page like google.com/nexus/. (Amazon won't let me post direct links)Do note that the rating is 1 due to the Amazon reseller's crazy high price. The phone is rated 5/5. :D                    Software-wise, it is a great phone. Hardware-wise, the phone is extremely fragile. This new Corning Gorilla Glass 2 is easily scratched and breakable, as is the phone itself. Google support is awful, and will find every way to be unhelpful. The phone slides from every surface, and if you drop it, that's it. I think Google could have come up with a better phone, but LG Nexus 4 is not it.                    Amazing phone. Sleek and comfortable to hold. Really fast and super responsive. But the camera is a dissapointment. It doesn't take good pictures but its not a deal breaker for me since I dont use the phone to take pictures.                    ** Bought directly from GoogleI have been using this phone for 6+ months now and I think you get what you pay for. Voice leakage during telephone conversations and a third-class camera are what killed it for me. I compared this phone to Galaxy S4 and the latter just blew it away... into very small pieces.For the price, it's a good phone. But my suggestion is to get top of the line Samsung or Apple, you won't have that awful feeling during a vacation that I wish I had a better camera or get embarrassed with awful voice quality.I could go on and on about the different bugs, especially with switching audio sinks (between bluetooth, headset, speaker...) or the inaccurate touchscreen that will drive you nuts but I will give it a rest.For the record I've probably got more perspective than most people posting here -- worked on Blackberry phones for a few years, have most of Apple products at home and have this guy as my primary phone along with two Android tablets (they are even worse) and a BB Playbook (a level above Android tablets). I really want to diversify away from Apple... as good as their products are I hate the cage they put you in...
!###UPDATE: SEE BOTTOM OF REVIEW.I held off on buying the Galaxy S3 since I knew this phone was being released, and after tinkering with several s3 phones this is clearly the best Android phone you can own.Size: - I was a bit worried about the screen size moving from a 4.3" Galaxy S2 to the 4.7" Nexus, but the screen actually feels more accessible. The technical specs say that the Nexus is larger in all directions, but laying them on the table side by side, the Nexus is thinner, slightly narrower, and a bit longer. The back of the Nexus is not rounded, but instead has formed edges. When I pulled the phone out, I expected that to feel awkward but really it just made the phone feel more stable in my hand. It feels solidly built even if it doesn't have that smooth feel of an aluminum back like on the iPhone. Part of feeling that way is it's weight which you can definitely sense, but is not prohibitive.Android 4.2 Jelly Bean:  - Alright, I fully admit to being an immature child about certain things, and this phone is playing on those tendencies. I took 5 or 6 photo spheres of my living room just trying them out. You can see one here: [...] . As you can see, the stitching doesn't work all that well in a small, enclosed area. It's been a bit too cold to do a good one outside but I imagine it will look a little bit better when the objects are further away.  - Google Now is just asking to be messed with. The voice recognition is good as long as you enunciate. My favorite part is testing to see what it will answer back with (it will tell you how old Samuel L Jackson is but won't tell you when your next appointment occurs). I am sure this will improve.  - Beam is awesome, but so few people I know have this feature. You can instantly share things from an app. I used youtube and told my wife I had a video she should watch. Rather than hand her my phone, I put her phone up to mine and tapped the screen and she could watch on hers. Score one for selfishness.  - Jumping from 2.3.6 to 4.2 means a bit of a learning curve. Some things I like, some things not so much. The dedicated real estate for the softkeys means the 4.7" screen is really only like 4.4. There is also way too much wasted space on the "hotseat" aka the dock or launch bar or whatever you want to call it. You could probably squeeze one more icon in the bar, but even more than that, the vertical space between the top and bottom of the bar is too big. Regardless, Netflix and other apps nuke the softkey bar.  - The mail app is fantastic now. I was sick of searching around for replacements for the stock mail app. Now my mail is taken care of.Speed: - The phone is crazy fast. I didn't really think my old phone was slow until I used this. Instant app launches, fast screen transitions, quick photo processing, it's all just fast. Obviously there is critique about the lack of LTE, which you can read about in depth elsewhere. For average phone users and even above average users who aren't serious whiners, the HSPA+ speeds are sufficient.Misc: - Screen is beautiful and readable in daylight (read my note about the softkeys and dock about screen real estate). - Call quality seems good but I have never been a stickler about phone audio. - Battery life is great and the phone easily gets through a day of regular use. - It looks smooth as the screen reaches very close to the sides of the phone. - Could've done without the sparkles on the back. - 16gb storage should suffice as long as you stream things (use Play Music, it is fantastic).Summary: If you have read this far, you either want to start a fight or you want this phone. For my two cents this is a phone you need to get if you are a fan of Android and are at least close to the cutting edge in terms of phone purchases. If it's time for a new phone, do yourself a favor and head over to the Google Play store and pick one up for $350. If you are peeing your pants in excitement, pay $600 here or ebay.Massive change in opinion:  Still read the above for my impressions about using the phone, but note that my review is really defined by the following two paragraphs.  Despite the fantastic experience I have had with the phone, in 5 months time I have had two phones break. The whole screen became unusable on both when they were dropped from less than two feet. The second one was in a case and it didn't matter, same effect. There are serious build concerns with having an all glass front and back.If you do buy this phone: 1) you MUST buy something for the back or it will slide off the table/chair/whatever. 2) Make sure you get a case that will completely eclipse the front so that no part of the phone will touch the ground ever. I no longer recommend this phone, sadly, even if it was great while it lasted.                    I bought this item on the 18th and I loved it but unfortunately ... it was a Lieit says 16GP ,nop , it's just a sticker on the box on the original one that says 8GP.the basic programs juts toke around 4GP and no external mini memory access on this phone.i barely can add anything without thinking of the tight memory.                    Listen, I applaud you for coming to Amazon and trying to get a Nexus 4 before everyone else. However you are paying an unnecessary mark up here people! The phones are listed as having a 3-4 week back order but I can tell you they really aren't that far backed up. Don't pay any extra here, this guy is probably going to ship you a phone that won't have any warranty or return policy (look at the other comments/reviews). Go get this amazing phone over at Google's Play site now!                    Nexus 4 is the best android smartphone at the current time.I have used Galaxy Nexus around 1 year and I switched it to Nexus 4. I love it.                    The vendor states "List Price:  $799.99" which is a complete lie. The list price is $349.99 from Google when available. This vendor is a liar and a thief.                    Clearly Google is selling a defective product with buggy wifi drivers.Phone will detect and connect to wifi but will drop the connection soon after.There are 5 other cell phones  in my home that connect to same network without any issues at all.  It isn't a router issue.  Google is not doing anything to resolve issue....I gave up, the phone is defective and google ignores the issue and blames router manufacturers.After tinkering the whole weekend I decided to return this phone.I am back to My old htc Desire. It has been connecting to any wifi ,without issue, from the moment I bought it two and a half years ago.Why can The N4 be just as reliable? why is  google ignoring their customers complaints, ignoring the issue, and yet continuing to push  the sale of a product that is defective? .....Googles arrogance shows, a promising but dissaponiting product( ...ultimately no Product support) you will be stuck without wifi or wifi issues for a very long time.If you are happy buying  'nice' defective products go ahead and buy it.                    Ni 24 horas de uso y el tel&eacute;fono se da&ntilde;o, no volvi&oacute; encender.Not 24 hours of use and damage the phone, she did not turn.                    t-mobile blames a defective phone, amazon will not replace it.  constantly dropping calls, does not maintain a stable network (bars continally change) cannot stream music due to instabilities,  being a lite internet user, this thing is junk to me because it does not work with any consistancy.  unfortunately the short return time frame to figure this out between provider and phone has passed... recommend to buy a different phone; especially if your with T-mobile.                    I just got the phone and haven't started using it yet, but 2 things are troubling me. The battery is not removable. That means the life of the phone is basically tied to life of the battery. I called tech support and they expect the battery to last at least 2 years and then work at 80% capacity after that. To extend battery life they said charge the phone between 40 - 80% most of the time and then completely drain it once/month.Also the SIM card is difficult to access. There is a tiny tray on the side and you have to use a tiny tool that they send to pop it open, so now I will need to carry this tiny tool in my wallet and try not to lose it in case I need to get the SIM card out.                    Not a review of the product as I don't own one; just a general complaint.I was all ready to buy one from googleplay and was disappointed to see that there is no microSD slot.  REALLY?!!!So, will not be ordering one now.  I'd like to know who is on the design boards of these Apple alternative products.  It's like they don't even care to try to give people a REAL reason NOT to buy apple.
!###It basically just came down to a point where I told myself this during a vacation:"I am not a professional photographer. I am just a serious hobbyist who likes getting quality pictures during family vacations. I do not shoot sports or fast action, I do not shoot weddings. What are you doing walking around Las Vegas with a Nikon D7000, big/heavy Nikon 17-55 F2.8 around your neck, along with the other lenses and your flash inside your camera bag which is hanging on your shoulder???"No more. To be honest, it was taking the "fun" away from photography. After a few hours of walking around during trips (wherever I would be), I would just feel tired and desperate to dump my camera bag somewhere and leave it there forever. At certain times, it started to feel more like a "duty" to crouch down and get this certain tough shot.Do not get me wrong. I am aware that with DSLR's, among other larger cameras, you are able to get magnificent results and shots that I may not get with my RX100M2. But you know what? It's vice versa. There will also be shots I get with my RX100M2 that I would never have gotten with my DSLR.The RX100M2 is plenty sufficient for what I shoot, which is 99% landscape/scenery, family portraits and some low light.....which is what this camera is made for. It has AMAZING image and video quality for a camera this size. It is as close to DSLR as you can get. VERY well built, not plastic cheap stuff. There is NO better traveling camera than this, period. It easily fits in my pocket, while giving me superb results.I plan to use this little gem like crazy.
!###I originally loved this camera as a step up from the RX100. The Wi-Fi is an amazing feature that I hope they include in all future models.However, some things have really disappointed me with this new model.1) Auto-focus is absolutely horrible (compared to the RX100). If I have a person in front of my about 2 1/2 feet and they take up 80% of the frame, the RX100M2 will &#34;focus&#34; on the background instead of the person taking up the bulk of the image. It's absolutely horrendous. I seriously hope they can release a firmware update as 50% of my (video) footage is out of focus because it seems to always want to give priority to the background instead of the object in the foreground.2) Whites throw off blacks. Sony's reason for this is &#34;The camera may judge a white subject to be bright and a black subject to be dark even if the subject is not actually bright or dark, and set the wrong exposure.&#34; - There should be an option to prioritize blacks and/or de-prioritize whites. If you take an image in auto-mode with a bunch of people wearing black pants and white tops, they look like they have no legs because of this problem.3) The wi-fi is really choppy. I'm using a samsung galaxy s3 so I'm not sure if it works better on an iPhone but you can't control the zoom well at all while recording. You tap to zoom in, it doesn't, so you do it again, then it lags and finally catches and zooms in 100% because your previous commands were registered but were lagging.Overall I think the cam is excellent and in some ways better than the RX100 but the image quality difference is negligible and they really have to fix that horrible, horrible auto-focus problem.                    When you realize how good the images produced by this camera are, considering the size of the camera, you know that you have something special, and likely the best compact camera with a zoom lens available as of now.  That being said, if you are a stickler for image quality, and many purchasers may be since this camera would make a worthy backup to a primary DSLR camera, you will need to experiment with zoom and f/stop combinations to get the very best that this camera can produce.  Personally, shooting exclusively RAW, I have found that for 50mm zoom and longer, f/8 gives me the sharpest images. For me, f/11 is LESS sharp. For around 35mm zoom try f/4, and for 28mm try f/5.6.  Your mileage may vary.  I get good results in Adobe Camera RAW by goosing sharpness and detail more than for my DSLR before bringing the image(s) into Photoshop CC.  Use your favorite sharpening in Photoshop (I like luminosity sharpening) and experiment, being a bit aggressive. Once you get that sharpness adjusted to your satisfaction, you will likely be quite pleased with this camera if you have ever used other (lesser) compact cameras.  I have searched for a very long time for a pocketable camera with excellent image quality for it's size.  This is the first one that I've found that makes the grade.  Bravo, Sony.                    I do fine art photography, and my regular camera is a D800. I got this because I wanted something to carry around all the time, not just when I was specifically on a photo shoot. This little thing is impressive, not just impressive for its size, but just darn impressive. While it doesn't have the flexibility that my bigger DSLR's have, when used properly the image quality is absolutely good enough to make big prints that are plenty good enough to show in a gallery.Now, for why I didn't give it 5 stars...For the price, it's missing a couple of things. I understand why something like the optical viewfinder or the filter adapter would be extra cost accessories, although I'm not sure I understand the pricing on the optical viewfinder. But no external battery charger? C'mon...The camera doesn't have enough battery life to last for a full day of shooting. A $750 camera aimed at advanced photographers should have a battery charger, so that I can charge one battery while shooting with another.The other thing is the manual. It's a useless pamphlet that doesn't really even cover the main features of the camera properly. The help button on the camera itself is useless as well. For example, if I go to the aspect ratio screen and push the help button, I get "sets the aspect ratio." If that's all the help you're going to provide, why bother with the button at all? Message to Sony...a good firmware upgrade for this camera would be to add help button messages that are actually helpful.The last thing is that when I'm using Auto-ISO, I can't tell what ISO I'm actually shooting with until after I've taken the shot. The display tells the aperture and shutter speed, and that I'm using Auto-ISO, but it doesn't tell me which ISO it has chosen. Since I print big, I'd like to have some idea how much noise is going to be in the image before I go banging away and shooting a bunch of shots that aren't usable because of ISO noise. UPDATE: A commenter helped me figure this out.  You have to hold the shutter button down halfway, then the actual ISO will display. I wish the manual said something about that.UPDATE 2 (Nov. 27, 2013): Now that I've had it a month and shot with it a lot, I'll add a couple of things. I still give it 4 stars, with pretty much the same pluses and minuses. It's small enough that I use it a LOT, much more than my D800, because I carry it with me everywhere. The ability to carry it everywhere has opened up whole new areas of photography that I hadn't really explored before. Image quality is still impressive for a compact. The poor manual is still poor. There are still features of the camera that I struggle with, like how to make the different autofocus modes work correctly, which are not addressed in the "manual". The other thing that caught me by surprise is how it behaves when the battery runs out. The display says that the battery is full until it is about to run out. Then, pretty much without warning, it runs completely dead and stops working, usually leaving the lens sticking out and the lens cap open. I've taken to carrying a USB cable in my pack so that I can get enough charge from my laptop to turn the bloody thing off when I run the battery dead.                    There is no such thing as the perfect camera.  In general, small cameras must sacrifice picture quality for convenience; most professional grade cameras must sacrifice portability.  I chose the RX-100- II as a possible compromise, choosing portability with the expectation that I would have the camera with me more often, and because of the relatively large sensor the photo quality would satisfy for most purposes. After about a month of use, I find the camera is slightly less portable than I thought.  At the same time the picture quality far exceeds my expectations.On the portability - it's a small point, but that was the rationale for getting a compact - it is just big and heavy enough to be awkward in my jeans pockets.  If the pocket is loose enough, like a jacket pocket, there is no problem, even if the power button is accidentally pushed and the lens extends.  But in my pants pockets, it's a squeeze getting the camera in and out, and if the lens extends when you reach in for the camera, extracting becomes a major operation.  After trying the pocket route for several weeks, I decided to purchase the beautiful Sony camera case that comes with a shoulder strap.  This is more convenient than digging the camera out of your pocket, although the camera is less concealed, but having the option works well for different shooting situations.The picture quality is much better than I expected. The main reason I chose this camera is the sensor size, which is among the largest of any compact camera.  Unsurprisingly, in my test comparisons of the same shot, it beat hell out of my older point and shoot, but I didn't expect it to run circles around my 5-year old Olympus DSLR.  SLRs are supposed to give better results than compacts, period.  Apparently not so.  Except for rare situations where an extended telephoto is needed, if picture quality is essential, there is no good reason for me NOT to use the Sony.  The resolution, color rendition, relatively low noise even at 1600 ISO and above, low light capability with its f1.8 lens, all this in addition to the extensive control features -- this is one terrific package.Some of the disadvantages (I've listed them below) were inherent in the design of a compact, so I don't downgrade it for being what it is.  I haven't tried all the features yet, including video, but overall for two main reasons so far I give this the highest rating:  1) The picture quality exceeds my expectations. I was planning to invest in a full-frame DSLR as well, but for my purposes, after seeing what this camera can do, I'm not sure I'll bother.  In the long run, this may offset the disadvantage of camera's expensive price; 2) There is virtually unlimited control if you want it, as much or more than most DSLRs.  But the two automatic modes quickly and accurately determine ideal settings if you're in a hurry or if you just prefer to leave decisions up to the camera.  In summary:The good:* compact - fits in jacket pocket or fanny pack, a bit of a squeeze for jeans, but beats an SLR for travel.* rugged construction, heavy weight (even though aluminum), doesn't feel cheap* Modest appearance for security: doesn't call attention to itself as an "expensive" camera.* fold down 3" LED screen - good for shading and angle shots.  - an upgrade from the earlier model RX-100 which does not fold out, and well worth the extra expense.* Superior quality photos for any camera, particularly a compact: -- considerably sharper, less noise and better color rendition than my SLR.* large sensor for a compact: close to 4/3 size* Good dynamic range:  ISO to 1600 with virtually no noise, higher when needed.* Fast lens: f1.8 max aperture (f4.9 at telephoto position). Great for low light situations.* Good resolution at 20 mp (RAW image), 6-8mp (.jpg).* sharp lens* Excellent macro position - as close as 2"* RAW capabilities (.arw) - see below* Flexible arrangement of dials and buttons, most are programmable to user's choice, a huge plus  (i.e., traditional "focus" ring can be used for manual focus, exposure compensation, ISO, aperture, shutter speed, etc.)* Lens cover closes when lens retracts - provides lens protection without having to place and remove cap.  A major convenience in my view.* Menu intuitive and extensive.* Good battery life.The bad:* No viewfinder -Difficult or impossible to compose shots in bright sun. This is a big sacrifice, but necessary for compactness.* Expensive for a compact, and expensive accessories (i.e.,case = $70)* Small size awkward to manipulate if you're used to full-size SLR.* Zoom only 3X telephoto, not extensive.* RAW files are proprietary Sony .arw - requires conversion to .dng for Lightroom 4, i.e., a slight inconvenience.* WI-FI doesn't connect to my iMac. Others have reported this problem.  I'm using Eye-FI instead, but the USB cable is fast and easy enough.  I haven't tried the NFC and probably won't have much use for it.* No GPS, but Eye-Fi memory card (optional) has WPS.* Some edge distortion at the extreme wide-angle position. Wide angle a good feature, but can be a problem with portraits -- may need to back up and use higher focal length to avoid distortion.* Slippery surfaces with no grip - danger of dropping, despite wrist strap.  Recommend grip accessory or Sony camera case (not included).* Sensitive power switch on top of camera, can activate when handling, i.e., when camera is in your pocket, extending the lens making it difficult to remove.*  No external battery charger included.  Recommend purchase inexpensive 3rd party charger with extra batteries, which works fine.EDIT:  I am about half way through "Photographer's Guide to the Sony DSC-RX100-II"  by Alexander S. White. Highly recommended if you want to learn the many outstanding, interesting, and fun features of this amazing camera. Did you know that in some modes the camera will take multiple shots and combine them to produce an image with less noise and camera shake in low light?  Who knew that dramatic panorama shots were so easy to take without a tripod?  Far from a crutch to avoid manual settings, the Scene modes are varied and great time savers.  Memory Recall mode, so you can program often-used settings that can be retrieved in an instant.  You probably won't use most of the features, but if you are serious about your picture taking, it will benefit you to know what this camera is capable of! There is no way you can learn all this intuitively.  I will write a complete review of this book when I am finished.                    Was thinking about buying a SLR camera but a professional photographer recommended this and it is excellent. The sensitivity in low light conditions is stunning. Highly recommend it.
!###I don't know about you but I like my pictures of peoples faces sharp so I can see the defects on there face!  Unfortunately I didn't try to return this product in the first 30 day so after 45 days when I called Sony support all they did was try to tell me what I was doing wrong and tried to give me suggestions on getting better pictures.  They wanted a specific situation where the picture quality was unacceptable, I told them all situations were unacceptable quality but they were no help.  They wouldn't take the camera in for repair so I am stuck with a lemon.  This is my 8 point and shoot and I have also had 3 DSLR's.  My current DSLR is a Cannon 5D MK2 with incredible picture quality, my current carry around camera is a Cannon G1X also with very good quality.  I purchased the DSC-RX100M2 because I wanted good quality in a compact size.  My former compact camera was a Cannon S90, a very nice camera and it looks like I will be purchasing a Cannon S120 soon to replace the RX100.  I take around 1,000 picture a month between my three cameras and cherish the pictures of family and friends.  My RX100 is unsuitable for any family memories or even pictures of scenery.  My suggestion to you before you purchase an RX100 is go to a camera shop with your own chip, take a few pictures, go home and view them on your computer screen.  If they are acceptable to you then maybe I just got a lemon.I tried shooting my pictures in RAW format and processing them using the Sony downloadable RAW software.  Don't bother it is the worst photo software I have ever used.  First It makes exposure adjustments in 1/3 of an F stop.  Cannon does in in 1/6 of an F stop, much better.  Also the Sony software is so slow that it makes processing RAW files unacceptable  My machine is a 6 core Intel with 9 GB of memory.  I tried it on my 4 core Intel machine and it is even slower!  Every time you make a exposure adjustment is takes approximately 15 seconds for the changes to display on the screen.  If you go back and forth between exposures like I do to find the proper setting it takes at least 3 minutes a picture to get the correct exposure and most time you must key in a value because it is somewhere between the 1/3 stops the use.  With the Cannon software I just roll the mouse back and fourth between three different exposures, one under, just right and one over exposed until I get the proper exposure.  Cannon does this in real time and it is a pleasure to use.  The Sony software is useless.For some reason someone at Sony thinks 1/30 of a second is proper shutter speed for taking flash pictures in the 'P' mode and 'A' mode??  I tried every adjustment but was unable to increase the speed in 'P' or 'A' mode.  Yes you can change the shutter speed in 'S' and 'M' mode but sometimes it is just nice in changing conditions to let the camera do the work.  I take mostly flash pictures so this was another bone of contention.This little camera has a real solid feel and lots of features, and real adjusters dream.  But for me image quality is everything and I see lots of camera's costing $200 with better image quality.  I have own lots of Sony products over the years, TV's, Stereo's, VCR's (remember them) etc but I figure this is my last Sony product.                    ..while it lastedmaybe a lemon, but of course i'll change this review when i get a better one.very quick shots and very clear with moving itemsseems to be good at night, but there is a very specific shot i need to try and see if this is good for.let you know of any updates
!###I purchased this camera about a month ago. The picture quality and versatility provided by this pocket-size point and shoot is simply amazing. Shoot raw, shoot jpeg, shoot raw + jpeg. Menus are more intuitive than expected. But, here is the real surprise--our town set this past Sunday as trick-or-treat day. I decided to get some photos of neighbor kids in costume as they walked up to our entry for their Halloween handouts. Best spot in the house, or so I thought, was a second story window overlooking the entry walk. I fixed the RX100m2 on a small Joby table top tripod (big mistake, the tripod is too light), opened the window, set the tripod/camera on the window ledge and backed off with the intent to be out of sight of the window and trigger the camera with my smartphone app. Before I could get my smartphone up and running, the tripod teetered, tipped and camera and tripod fell to a rocky garden two stories below. When I retrieved the camera, to my surprise, not a scratch or dent and it worked flawlessly. I would not try to replicate this fall, but from my experience, I will say this is one tough little pocket camera.                    I'm not a professional photographer and I don't know all the options or modes. However, the Superior Auto mode in this camera never disappointed me in taking astonishing images. Since I got the camera I didn't even feel the need to change the mode, just turn it on and snap. When you see that the results are wonderful you become encouraged to take more pics everyday. Now I became addicted to carrying my camera everywhere I go.Transferring pictures from the camera to my phone/desktop was a major hindrance in Sony RX100, when I heard the new Sony RX100M comes equipped with NFC & WiFi I upgraded instantly and wasn't disappointed.To be honest the NFC didn't work right away and I have issues to resolve for the phone to connect to the camera with a touch. However, the WiFi option is amazing and works just fine. Before getting the camera I couldn't confirm from the site or anywhere that I can transfer a bulk of images in one batch, all websites and reviews focused on controlling the camera via phone and not transferring photos. When I bought the camera I realized it's available as well and when you preview an image you just need to press the menu button and then choose "Send to Smart Phone" and follow the steps while you run Playmemories app on your phone. Again to confirm, this works for a single or multiple images and you get the option to mark what you want to be sent.I also read some negative reviews about the images quality in low light conditions is worse than RX100. For me at least This proved very wrong, I can't express how amazingly better the images are in low light, whoever used both cameras will notice the difference in no time.                    This review specifically pertains to buying the RX100M2 from Amazon Warehouse.  I bought the camera as 'used-very good' with the description that it was suppose to have minor cosmetic imperfection on the front .5x.5&#34; and item was repackaged.  When I received it, the only thing that I could tell after very close inspection was maybe a fingerprint on the front of the item. Other than that, the entire camera appeared completely clean and new with no scratches anywhere.  All accessories were present, and the camera functioned as it should for being turned on for the first time.  The box was original and appeared a bit dinged up.  I highly recommend anyone considering a used purchase to trust the amazon warehouse.                    What can I say... As many others have pointed out, this is pretty much the best camera in its class. Those giving it one or two stars have a long  way to go In regards to serious photography. Its behavior at the highest ISO ratings is simply unbelievable. Practically no noise at all. The active stabilization, especially intended for movie shooting, is outstanding. I placed the camera on my dashboard and started filming. You could see the car going up and down and the image stayed  rocksteady. It is really not a point-and-shoot camera, since in order to get the best possible results some human intervention is required. I mean, your wife would be disappointed. I have decided to leave my heavy DSLR  gear at home, except for special occasions, and only bring this one with me. I mean, I can put it in my shirt pocket! I am simply in love with this show of wizardry.                    Ohhhh! what a nice camera short of a DSLR but much smaller, so I like much better. The MII has a tilt screen which is ok, but not a necessity, also the hot shoe is no big deal as the EVF is way too expensive. Don't care about the wifi & other connectivity, but you may. I am a point and shoot, (like 7,000 pics in Tikal) not a pro or amateur enthusiast. But this thing can probably do all sorts of things for either type of person.A must is the Sony case as this thing is small, heavy, and slippery (and expensive to drop). Great pics and video.  Much better than my previous, a Canon A640 with a tele & wide angle lens. And it took very good pics.                    I began my prosumer photography only a few years ago when I bought a Nikon D40X with 15-200mm VR lens back in January of 2007. I would haul around that camera everywhere I went and got very good at setting and framing shots. But as time went on I noticed I wasn't taking my camera with me as much, then not at all. The issue for me was the size and the amount of storage space I required for my other lenses and accessories. I felt odd carrying all of that around.So at the of 2011 I made the plunge into mirrorless and sold all of my Nikon gear and bought a Fujifilm X10. The camera took some really great photos but in order to accomplish things like good dynamic range or a bokeh effect the camera did a little trickery putting two images together. The results were fairly stunning but the image size was cut in half, to roughly 6MP. This made large prints out of the question. This kind of bothered me and made me wonder if I had gone too far away from the DSLR lines.My next attempt was with the Sony NEX F3 camera in early 2013. That camera was fantastic and I was getting DSLR-like images at about half the weight. But I quickly understood that with the interchangeable lenses, I was going to run into the same problem I had with my DSLR. I bundled it up and returned it after only 1 weekend.I was so impressed with the Sony NEX and it's awesome flexible flash that you could point toward the ceiling or wall with your finger during a shot to get indirect lighting that I found myself looking at the Sony RX100. There was a lot to like about the RX100 and it checked off a lot of my needs. But I wasn't sure if it would be quite right so I waited. And I'm really glad I did because the RX100-M2 is everything I was hoping for and more. It's highly portable and even pocketable in a pinch. It has that flexible flash. The backside illumination on the sensor and higher ISO means I get great shots in low light. Incredible amounts of detail in every shot that I can zoom in on and crop thanks to the generous 20MP size. The camera performs so well that I actually used it to shoot my cousin's wedding and some of the shots I got look every bit as professional as shots you see from high-end cameras. All-in-all I believe I have found my every day camera (until phone cameras catch up and then the point-and-shoot is over).
!###I was about to buy  the Sony RX100 M2 today (Oct 29, 2013) until I did an online chat with Sony TECH Support. I asked if the WiFi on the camera is compatible with MAC OS 10.9 (the latest MAC OS). They told me that NO IT IS NOT compatible. Then I asked them when Sony would update their software to be compatible with MAC OS 10.9. The response was NO DATE AVAILABLE. This was very disappointing to me and my purchase has been cancelled until I have assurance that a very expensive (for me) Sony camera and my MAC with OS 10.9 are fully compatible.I wonder if anyone here has tried to use WiFi on this camera with MAC OS 10.9 would love to be wrong on this but the answers I got from Sony TECH Support on this were crystal clear!!!!!                    I saw many camera in this category and found RX100M is a good value for me. This camera is very good. There is no doubt in the functions, quality and technology. I found the bundle with this camera in the same price. You can see it.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DP22QGQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00DP22QGQ&linkCode=as2&tag=amzblf-20ORhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DUX3T3E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00DUX3T3E&linkCode=as2&tag=amzblf-20                    Sony has to rethink the whole Wi - Fi idea because as long as there is NO manual option to turn it off and this has been checked and true by Sony Tech Support - this camera is absolutely useless in many siutations.More and more hospitals put in the wireless connections between life support devices and more and moreof them absolutely ban any of your devices that need live Wi Fi... so you do the math.You got your new baby and want to take million pictures but you can't.Another situation - airplains and airports and other situations and areas that are absolutely restricted... while you can take pictures with cameras that do not have Wi Fi..By similar token some people are sensitive to Wi Fi and one can not use it around them thereforehaving the device that can't turn the Wi Fi.. that is just piece of junk.Why can't Sony add this option?In Europe more and more places bans Wi Fi... soon this camera along with all other NEX this and NEX thatwill be obsolete because of this.
!###The BEST thing you can do to preserve the lens & value of this camera is to order/use Mega West's MegaGear Multi-Coated LENS ARMOR UV attached FILTER Sony Cyber-shot RX100, RX100 II. I bought several so if/when my filter got scratched, I could replace it immediately.Having & replacing an inexpensive but excellent lens filter is much better than ruining your lens. The only flaw (and I cannot really call it a flaw) of this camera is that the lens is vulnerable.                    I have been looking for and pricing point and shoot cameras for quite some time. I had to decide should, I go in debt and get a full senscor camera or get something very good with a smaller sensor. Well full sensor point and shoot are more problematic then you would think it not just the price. A full sensor using average lenses can cause you to lose resolution out away from the center of your pictures. So to get a point and shoot with a great lens or lens system and full sensor, I would have to pay over $2000 and I just can't see paying that much. Also I did not want a lens system camera anyway, I already have a very good Canon DSLR (with a 4.3 Sensor) and I really wanted a point and shoot as a second camera to take with me everywhere. So After doing lots of research I decide to buy this Sony RX100M2 and I am very happen with my decision. First off the price was reasonable. Second the camera is very well constructed. Its made of metal and has a nice bit of weight feel to it. It can still be easily put in pockets purses etc., It is a bit thick but not bad (so probably not for a Shirt pocket). The Lens is a Large-aperture F1.8 Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T lens which is about as good as you can get for a point and shoot Zoom lens. When you take this good lens and combine it with 20 megapixals and Sony's New 1.0 inch Exmor R(tm) back-illuminated CMOS sensor you get supper good picture quality. The Back lighting gives you even better low light shooting (Which I have tested and found to be excellent, even netter then my DSLR), I will post some pictures later its amazing in a dark setting without the flash and all the pictures are very very sharp. The Camera is really idiot proof (speaking for myself hear) you can simply put it in Intelligent Auto, which will do everything for you or even into Intelligent Auto Plus which takes a series of pictures and interlays them into one super sharp picture. In these modes the camera picks what you need, Night Mode, Landscape, Portrait, Portrait Night, Sports, Sunset, Baby, etc., You can also use SCN (= Scene mode) and pick the mode you want, I find that in shooting sunsets the sunset mode is a help.  If you want to control the photography more, you can use Program, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, or Full Manual. You can also bracket and do just about everything a DSLR can do. I won't go crazy hear listing all the camera does Amazon has done a great job above listing everything. I do what to say if your computer is windows you can get your software at Sony's website (it comes up on your camera viewing screen the first time you plug it in to your computer), and you can also go wireless with the camera. While if your on mac your I Photo or Aperture will take over for you by downloading the drivers etc., for this camera. I have not tried every feature yet, such as panoramic (I have tried it but I get a failure when I use it I am not study enough, I will try again with the built in Level next time to see if that helps), I do not use the Wi fi so I can't commit on it (I still have a regular cell phone yes I am in the stone ages) and also since I error on the panoramic feature  I have not been able to see how it works with mac yet (I use aperture on mac). I will report back on how that works by adding to this review. So Far I love this camera. SO FAR, I am very happy with my choice, its really great for getting those quick shots when I am out around the state.                    this pricey new Sony RX 100M II had all the bells and whistles plus wiFi which makes moving pics from camera to other electronics possible. I am quite pleased with this purchase which arrived ahead of schedule.                    I just spoke to tech- they said it IS compatible with latest iOS soft wear . Haven't purchased it yet
!###Impressive. I wanted a dslr but was worried about the bulk on trips. This camera get most of the way there. Love it. And yes it has an amazing shallow depth of field.                    Simply put, the Sony RX100 II has the best image quality you can get from a compact point and shoot. While it has improved in some ways over its predecessor, there are still a number of refinements that need to be made in terms of autofocus performance, exposure, and ergonomics. Please note that I don't do video, so I can't really speak much to the video performance on this camera.The image quality, like I mentioned, is superb. The camera produces rich, vibrant, and detailed images right out of the box. Honestly, you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between it and similarly priced DSLRs until you get past ISO1600. It takes an OK ISO3200 shot. But I would shoot and process RAW at that sensitivity due to an excessive amount of noise reduction being applied to JPEGs in order to keep files clean (which smears fine detail). The camera still has a problem with overexposing, which is not a huge issue, but what is especially annoying is that you cannot apply exposure compensation while in Manual mode. Meanwhile, the Canon G16 has a physical dial right on the camera itself in which you can adjust the exposure compensation in any shooting mode. But overall, I think it has improved over an already decent performance from the RX100.While autofocus performance is generally satisfactory...it is not accurate at all in low light in its default settings. In a lot of instances, instead of pinpointing what you are trying to focus on, the camera throws up a big box for the autofocus area. It's better if you set the AF yourself when shooting in low light. However, the overall speed of the autofocus system is a bit faster than its predecessor.The ergonomics issues remain. I don't understand why Sony chose not to address what was one of the biggest complaints about the original RX100, which is the lack of any sort of grip up front as well as the slippery metal surface You can buy a grip for the camera, which is highly reccomended. The screen on back is excellent though, and it helps that it articulates out on this model as well.Image stabilization, which was an issue on the RX100, has improved and I can't think of an instance where I've had trouble with it. Battery life is suprisingly good despite its small size. But I would consider purchasing an extra battery for extended periods of use. The menu system works fairly well and isn't too overly confusing, but perhaps it could be a little more intuitive.The big question is, should you spend the extra money and get this over the original RX100? I think it's worth it. While I still have some gripes about the shooting design and some aspects of the camera's performance, the camera has improved in two critical areas (image quality and image stabilization) which make it worthwhile. And overall, while not perfect, the camera's operational speed is more than satisfactory. The more I shoot with the Sony RX100 II, the more I come to realize how Canon really blew it with their first large sensored enthusiast compact, the G1X. Had they produced something that at least matches the operational speed of the RX100 II, then that might have been a compelling alternative. But, for now, I think the RX100 II sits at the top of the enthusiast compact category.                    This camera really blows me away. Got it on a warehouse deal for over $100 off suggested Amazon price. No marks on it whatsoever (even though the warehouse said it had a few blemishes - I can't find them). The pictures are incredible. Clarity is nuts. Night shots are extremely impressive. Really am blown away by this thing. Still learning all of the functions, it is VERY powerful. The &#34;focus ring&#34; is okay. I had higher hopes but it just isn't quite there. Even with that said, this camera is a beast. I also got a dark wood grip for it from JB camera which is an awesome addition. I *can* fit this thing in my back pocket of my somewhat slim jeans fairly well but better take it out before you sit down. P.S. I'm a dude. Screen tilting is pretty useful and the Android app functionality coupled with the NFC is so awesome to use. Can't wait to take this puppy on my Europe trip this winter.5 stars.                    My wife and I purchased this camera for our latest trip to Australia. Boy are the images amazing! I have never seen such high resolution, crystal clear images come from such a little camera. We both remarked how the camera shoots like a $10,000 professional model. I think that I could shoot Sports Illustrated on this camera.                    This replaced my Canon S90 with coating that was peeling off the lens. It fits in your pocket (if not get some looser pants) and takes great shots.Pros:ResolutionopticsconvenienceCons:Not enough dials/programmable buttons menus suckNFC not seamless with Nexus7 2013 or Note Galaxy3 Why?Sony's insulting accessory PRICE GOUGING. The camera itself is overpriced. but the accessories are pure theft. I won't submit.
!###Like many of my generation, my photography interests started with smart phones.  Unlike many of my peers I was never interested in ruining my photos with instagram(it probably helped that instagram wasn't available for Windows Phone at the time).  I started with the Lumia 920 which was the first smart phone to introduce optical image stabilization; I enjoyed taking superior low light pictures with it and read up about the technology behind OIS.  These pictures while excellent compared to other smart phones still resulted in a lot of blur and/or noise especially with moving objects in low light(a limitation of OIS).  In good light the 920 was merely ok.  I then moved up to the Lumia 1020 which builds upon the 920 by adding a xenon flash, a 41 mega pixel 2/3&#34; sensor with OIS, and full manual controls in the camera app.  The 1020 was a definite leap over the 920, but it still wasn't enough; the slow shot to shot times, the lack of optical zoom, and the inferior optics were enough to convince me to buy a real camera.I researched DSLRs but was dismayed by their bulk.  I couldn't see myself lugging around a DSLR and appropriate lenses to the places I really wanted to shoot, concerts and parties.  I did some research and stumbled upon the RX100.  I read reviews and looked at camera sensors and the RX100 seemed to have a leg up on other compact cameras.  I saw the M II and read about the additional features such as NFC and WiFi which really appealed to me(even though there isn't a Sony PlayMemories app for Windows Phone).  After reading countless reviews I finally made up my mind to graduate to a RX100 MII.I am impressed by the quality, flexibility, and size of the RX100 MII. I have taken some amazing shots with the RX100 MII; shots that wouldn't be possible or at best lower quality on my Lumia 1020 and I am glad I have moved up.  I still use my 1020 as my &#34;carry everywhere&#34; camera, but I make sure to have my RX100M II ready for the shots that matter most to me.I wouldn't put it past me to one day &#34;upgrade&#34; to a DSLR, but I use the term &#34;upgrade&#34; loosely as I know a DSLR will never replace the portability of the RX100M II.  This is an investment in good, pocketable photography that I see myself using for the foreseeable future.                    I love this camera. I've been meaning to buy the RX100 but forgot about it and by the time I remembered to get it, this model had already come out&#8230; And I'm glad I forgot!This model is even better than its predecessor. I typically use my DSLR when I travel and want to take high quality shots but I found myself needing a lighter camera because taking my DSLR with me (with all the lenses I have) has taken its toll. But I wanted shots of like quality if not, then something at least a couple levels higher than my iPhone which I typically use for quick shots.This camera is the answer! I love it. I bought mine from a Sony outlet store a few days ago and have not regretted my purchase since. I haven't tinkered through it thoroughly yet but I did try the wi-fi features including the NFC and so far so good!Considering all that I've said so far, the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5? Because of the price. It's just way too expensive. Although the camera's features may make up for its hefty price tag, it still hurts thinking of the amount I spent on it. Yikes.                    This is the smallest camera for its class of image quality and the best image quality for its class of camera size.  I don't want to repeat what have been said elsewhere.  Just note a few features I found very useful:1. Flip-out LCD - Great for odd-angle shots.2. Panorama -  Great effect.  If you hold the camera vertically and set Panorama direction to Top, it effectively increases the wide-angle focal length to about 21mm.3. Macro lens - 5 cm focus distance.  With dSLR camera, you need to pay extra to get macro lens.  This opens up many new picture potentials.  Coupled with F1.8 at wide-angle, it produces macro images with nice blurred background.  Great effect.4. F1.8 - F4.9 - Nice max aperture.  Although it decreases rapidly as the focal length increases, it is still a good feature.5. Wifi - Send the picture to smartphone and share on social network instantly.  (Tip - Use the Sony PlayMemory Mobile App setting to set whether to send full-size or 2MP picture to smartphone.)6  Wifi - Use smartphone as remote control.  Note the camera automatically gets in Auto mode when you do this.  So I could not trigger some long exposure time with remote control.Wish list for features (besides better image, bigger aperture, smaller size :-):1. I wish the color saturation is more finely tunable.  The pop-color picture effect is too much.2. In-camera editing.  This is just software.  I think it is realistic to do.                    4-STARS &#62; Picture quality (both video and stills) is superb, outstanding.  MUCH better than my iPhone 5s, much better than my old Panasonic camera.  Controls and menu's are ok, not super complicated, but far from simple.Camera was pretty slick to hold, added after market &#34;gripper&#34; and much more comfortable with it.  Battery life is very good, easy to focus, very nice lens.Extremely small, will fit in the pocket of my jeans, or in a jacket.All in all I am extremely pleased with the camera, what held it back from 5 stars?The WiFi and the unbelievable lack of integration with any Apple product.  PlayMemories does not run on a Mac / OS X, period, you can't wirelessly sync the camera with a Mac, you can push / pull pictures, but it's not intuitive.So great camera, VERY happy with picture quality
!###I was a previous iPhone user, until I switched from the 4 to a Galaxy S2, and I loved it, but there were alot of things wrong with the S2, Samsung has listened to user feedback and used their experience to make this 4.8 inch masterpiece.  Why do I love this phone so much?1) Performance - Scrolling is buttery smooth, gaming is buttery smooth, even throwing NOVA 3 at it will not phase that quad-core Exynos 4212 and the improved Mali-400 beast (oh I mean chip) inside this phone. It blows the Tegra 3 and the Snapdragon S4 clean out of the water, sorry One X owners.2) Audio - The S2 has okay audio quality, it's Yamaha chip was fine for...most people, however it was a bit disappointing compared to even the iPhone's sound quality, so I always used software decoding for listening to music.  The S3 has seen Samsung's return to the Wolfson audio chip, and it is absolutely stunning especially with the new SoundAlive system which allows Bass Boosting, Clarity, and Virtualization out of the box.3) Camera - The S2's camera was good, the S3's camera is even better. It may be a 'measly' 8MP, but Samsung has played around with the software in order to create a camera with zero shutter lag, a definite plus.  Now it can take great looking photos, quickly.4) Battery Life - The GS2 has a notoriously horrible battery life, it was basically essential to root and install custom ROMs because of the battery life.  The GS2 had a 1650 mAh battery, the S3 has a 2100 mAh battery.  It may have even more power than the S2 but the battery life is definitely improved, I just watched over 2 hours straight of 720p video and the battery meerely went from 85% to 70%. If this was my GS2 it would have gone from 85% to 60 or even lower.  Battery life while using data has also been improved, an hour of internet browsing hit my battery only 10% rather than the 20 or 30 that would have been seen on the S25) The feel - The S2 was made out of plastic, very light plastic that felt cheap.  Of course I know better than to judge how "cheap" a phone is by lightness, but many other reviewers hated it for this very reason.  Samsung answered by making the S3 out of poly-carbonate, the same material as a One X.  As a result, it feels solid and light in my hand, amazingly it managed to be 5g heavier than the One X while feeling so much lighter.6) The "new" TouchWiz - I know TouchWiz has had alot, I mean alot of hate over the years.  I hated TW3 myself, and didn't enjoy the orignal TW4, only enjoying it's lock screen.  The new Touchwiz shipped out with this phone that has a nature feel to it feels great.  The ripple effect on the unlock is very enjoyable and I enjoy the Galaxy Nexus inspired app drawer.  As a plus I am so grateful to Samsung for removing the horrible Social and Media Hubs.Of course however...in everything there are things you don't like, and this is no different.  The HD Super Amoled screen is great, but, I really wish that for this phone they would have created the Plus version.  The Pentile matrix is just inferior to the RBG RBG layout.  The ppi is high enough however to stop the picture from being blurry, so its just a nitpik. The things like SmartStay and S-Voice are frankly gimmicks though, and while they seem to have potential they don't really...work. Frankly Iris is better than S-Voice.                    I got the S3 yesterday, since I owned a iPhone 4S here the comparison:DESIGN: Galaxy S3 design is stunning, the feeling on hands is incredible. The ergonomics makes all the difference. The iPhone 4S is very squarish and definitely more solid but heavier too (way heavier);SCREEN: Galaxy S3 screen is wonderful with vivid colours and sharp imaages, 4,8 inches vs 3.5 of the iPhone, after you make the transition you wont never come back, impossible.OPERATING SYSTEM: S3 usability is a boom. iPhone is good but never at the level of the S3, way way slower.BATTERY: S3 gets full day + 30% remaining battery, iPhone last till four or five PM;GPS: Galaxy S3 gets locked in less than 10 seconds inside a building, iPhone searches and searches with no success;CAMERA: they are very similar, S3 is faster and iPhone is may be a bit better in term of quality. No dramatic difference.S-VOICE vs SIRI: they are both very basic and more fun than usefull.USB-BLUETOOTH: iPhone only works with iTunes, no Bluetooth, no radio. Galaxy S3 can be usb-connected to computers and flashmemory, it has easy bluetooth connection and yes ... it has an amazing radio :)APPS: to be sincere, all relevants apps in iPhones are present in Android. They have better design but they are at payment while in Android are always free. No mayor differences.Galaxy S3 is an extraordinary good purchase. Recommended for all ex-iPhone users. You wont regret, there is a world outside iTunes :)                    This is without a doubt the best phone I've ever owned. I dropped the iPhone 4S for this phone. Didn't expect to like it more than the iPhone 4S, but kept an open mind and decided to try it out. Glad I did. The screen on this phone is amazing.I use Google services like email, calendar and docs. I wanted a more integrated phone and that's what I got. I switched from iTunes to Google Music, which is fantastic. I'm deep in the cloud now and I love it.Android is freedom. I am using the Swift 3 keyboard. I have a thing for great keyboards and I love how Android lets us choose the keyboards we want.Next, I went with GoSMS rather than stock SMS. Much better. Using TweetCaster Pro as my twitter client. Using Google Currents, Google Reader and Pocket for daily news. For notes I am using EverNote. For tasks, I went with GTasks to sync with my Google tasks.Using GMail, and Chrome for Android for email and browser. Google Music for music, BeyondPod as my Podcasting client, and Audible's own client for my Audible books. Google Play Movies for movies and TV shows, Google Books and Magazines for books and magazines.Google Maps and Places turn by turn directions and finding common places like coffee shops and so on. Facebook and Google plus for social along with the twitter client.There are tons of games. Cut the Rope, Amazing Alex, Angry Birds, Defender, FieldRunners and so many others. I have about 20 games on this phone. QuickOffice for office documents which ties into Google Docs and DropBox.There is nothing this phone can't do. And you get an amazing screen that makes my iPhone screen look like a postage stamp. With Apple, I got tired of the same design, same screen, same icons in much the same way. Hello widgets! I have HD Widgets and they are beautiful. My clock / weather widget is big, bold and beautiful. I can even adjust the color of the font!!All my banks are supported, and Mint is available as well.Lot's of GPS apps for running. FitBit, Loseit and so on to keep tabs on food intake and calories burned.I also found this super cool package tracking app called ShipRack. You email a tracking number and they add it to your phones Shiprack tracking app.Samsung gave me white headphones which have pause / play and forward reverse buttons. So I can control my music from the headphones. I also picked up a pair of UrBeats from the AT&T store, plus a BlueTooth sports headphones for when I run.This is a great phone for business and personal uses. It's stylish and fast. You won't feel lag and you add more storage capacity for about $30 for 32 more GBs.Soooo much better than my iPhone. At least I think so. If for no other reason than the email client. So easy to email anything. We have a full file system which makes attachments a breeze. OMG how much I wanted that one feature!                    First, this is a review of the US version of the phone. I tried to put a review up on the US version, but Amazon wouldn't let me. So hopefully this helps out people deciding to get the US version of the phone. In case people are wondering this is for the Sprint network.The US version of the phone differs as it has a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Processor with 1.5 GHz Dual-Core CPUs, while the the rest of the hardware specs are the same as the international version.I switched from an HTC EVO 4G to get this phone and so far it's been great! Here are the things I like about the phone:* The phone is a nice size, it's lighter than my HTC EVO 4G.* The processor is one of the fastest US released Android phone, and it comes with 2 GB of RAM.* I played around with the camera and video camera and the quality is great in my opinion. (I'll post some pics or a video later.)* The ICS 4.0 is really snappy and it opens up applications quickly.* It comes with Google Wallet. I signed up and got a free $10 to use. (I'm going to McDonald's to test it out!)* I've only use the S Voice application a few times, but it seems to be just like Siri on my wife's iPhone 4S.* It comes with a micro SD slot in case more space is needed to save pictures, videos, etc.* You can change out the battery if needed.* Battery life last twice as long compared to my HTC EVO 4G.Now for some cons:* This is carrier related and not the phone itself, but there is no 4G LTE on the Sprint Network. Other networks such at AT&T and Verizon should be better, but I'm stuck with 3G speeds for now.* The phone is so nice, that I baby it all the time!I was on the fence about getting this phone or the HTC EVO 4G LTE aka HTC One X. The main things that I like over the the Samsung Galaxy 3 over the HTC EVO 4G LTE is that it comes with the Micro SD slot and also the battery can be changed if it ever goes bad.I love this phone! :)                    Buyers beware the phone is not supported by Samsung US. My just phone died after 5 months of use and now I have spent almost 5 hours of chatting and calling different folks from Samsung and no one would take responsibly. The seller should have mentioned this while selling the product.                    I am amazed by the power of my Galaxy S3.It is as flexible as a PC Windows computer, you just drag and drop files to its directory, and run the appropriate apps to use it, music, movies, all work great. It is a perfect complement to my Windows 7 computer. In a Iphone, all transfer must be done using Itunes, and it is very limited and frustrating-One of the best uses I can do is using this phone to download movies, music, and youtube videos, then when I am back home, transfer the files back to my Windows PC using simple drag and drop with windows explorer. Amazing! You cannot do it with Iphone, no way! You have no limitations using Galaxy 3.Android is based on Linux, and Linus is based on Unix, its power is astounding and amazing in the Galaxy S3. I tried and ran the old DOS Foxplus and Microsoft Foxpro database program in it, using a DOS emulator, and they ran perfectly, no problems! Better if you download a transparent keyboard in the play store. Amazing!Sometimes I wonder why Microsoft does not allow us to run in fullscreen our DOS programs  in Windows 7 and 8 like the Samsung Galaxy does. In this way, the universe of programs you can run increase dramatically. You can have both worlds, Unix( Anroid) and Microsoft DOS.Almost all the apps in the Play store are free, you can download the ones to suit your need. The selection of apps are comparable to IPhone IOS appstore. However, there are fewer games for the kids. But for adults, there are more, because adult apps are allowed. I spent more than a $1000 for apps for my IOS devices, and $0 for my Galaxy S3. There are many outstanding apps, including an amazing app for downloading Youtube videos at a speed faster than downloading a mp3 in a desktop PC, incredible!There are more beautiful apps for music and streaming using the Galaxy S3 than Iphone, because they are allowed and legal, and not allowed in the Itunes environment.Apple also made money from you by storage upgrade. In S3, upgrade using a 32 g. SDcard is just about 20-30 dollar, you have to pay more than $200 for a 64 g. Iphone.The processing speed of the CPU is faster than Iphone 4S, my Flipboard program run faster in S3. Most apps from the same vendors run better in Galaxy S3 than Iphone 4S, noticeably movie and music live streaming apps. I used this phone in America to streaming live tv program from China and Hong Kong, watch live soccer games from Spain and Europe, and streaming and downloading musics from other countries. Downloading a song of 4 mega is less than 10 seconds, faster than a desktop computer.However, I am a computer/math professional. From my point of view, Iphone is better for the majority of people for its easier user interface, Iphone just plug and play, need to learn nothing, Apple has done it fantastically to the mass with almost zero learning curve. Galaxy S3 is better for the professional who knows and understands computers and programming to exploit its resources. I spent some times exploring and learning my S3 interface and capabilities, at the beginning I was confused and lost!                    I've never had any android device and at first I was a little apprehensive, coming from a blackberry the difference is noticeable. I'm very happy, tons of apps, low price, no exclusivity problems (like the nokia lumia 900 or iphone). I had the opportunity to handle an iphone for quite some time and I really don't get why people like it that much, this phone is way better, has a lot of functions and a real screen. I absolutely recommend it. And regarding the other review, probably that MORON is installing the SIM card backwards, the phone is fully unlocked and operational.                    Product &#34;international Version&#34; seems to mean no Samsung Support and no Samsung warranty. Surge Telecom is less than useless they seem to not care. Check blogs and check Surge Telecom site. A product on there site talks about a bad component in the s3 international and offers a product that they claim to correct it. After your 15 day return window closes then the 30 day A to Z insurance is over you are on your own.                    3 months after I got the phone it stopped charging.  We waited for more than 2 weeks while it was "repaired" in Texas.  When the phone was returned it still wouldn't charge.  After a couple more calls a new charger and battery was sent to us.  With the new battery it started charging, but would drop phone calls a few minutes into a phone call.  Once again we had to send it to Texas for repair.  We received the phone this morning and it is missing the SIM card and the back cover.  They say they've lost the SIM card and I have to go buy a new one.  I've had to call half a dozen times to get things fixed and each time I get transferred to 2 or 3 different departments and it takes 30-60 minutes or more.  It's been over a month and I still don't have a working phone--and all this time I've been paying for service.  I like the phone when it works, but the Samsung support model is such a disaster that I will never purchase a Samsung product again.  When my iPhone failed I took it to the Apple store and they replaced it in less than half an hour.                    Beware of buying this product, it's very likely to suffer the Sudden Death syndrome (Google about it), and no warranty is honored neither by the store nor Samsung for the International Version. I've been a Samsung fan for a long time, but this has been a huge disappointment, so no more Samsung products for me. Their warranty model is just a joke.
!###Okay, I was a bit skeptical when ordering this phone, for one I did not want to be ripped off buy the seller. overall I was just scared that I would be blowing $650.00 for the phone.I ordered the phone on the 9th of July 2012 and I received it on the 11th of July(express shipping of course) and I was so pleased with the delivery time, it got to me a day earlier. The phone is awesome. I was scared at first when my old SIM car would not fit but thanks to the help of youtube you can cut down your SIM card into a micro SIM card (no guarantees) but luckily it did work.I contacted the seller and within 10 minutes I got a response.( I contacted the seller cause I could not get my SIM card in the slot so I thought I got a bad phone but then I realised that is how the phone is made, just like the  Iphone 4s it requires a micro SIM card which you should be able to get from your service provider.)So if you ever doubt ordering something so expensive. This review is for youIt came neatly packed, with headphones, charger, manual and the phone of course.So far the phones performance has been spectacular, the S voice is incredibly amazing and much more improved from the galaxy S 2. The graphics is also very great. In terms of battery performance its okay for a phone that has high performance, but if you have a car charger and one at home you should be good to go.You wont regret it!!!!                                  The top of the page describes the phone as the i9300 international version of the Galaxy S3, however, in the description it says the processor is the dual core Snapdragon.  US versions have the dual core Snapdragon processor, while the international version has the quad core Exynos processor.  If the description is accurate, then this is NOT the international version of the phone.  By some of the reviews, it appears this seller just throws any old S3 into a box and ships it.                    If you buy this item, beware that Samsung support is REALLY BAD! Read on...I got a Galaxy Note about one year ago from Amazon. It broke twice in less than one year.Since I live in Brazil, I first contacted Samsung Brazil for support. Samsung Brazil said it is not their problem, as long I got the device from a US store.I then contacted Samsung support for the USA. Samsung US said it is not their problem, as long it is an international version of the device.I finally contacted Samsung Korea. Guess what. They said that, since I live in Brazil, it a problem for Samsung Brazil, not Samsung Korea.As a result I have a non working Galaxy Note in my desk for about 3 months now!!!What a lousy post-marketing strategy (if any)!!!!                    This item doesn't have any kind of warranty. I bought it just 6 months ago from Amazon.com, because I needed an unlocked phone as I use two sims from two different countries. And it just died for no apparent reason. I contacted Samsung USA, however, I was told that as it was an international version not sold in the US it wasn't supported either! They proposed me to contact Samsung UK. Samsung UK told me since I bought the phone in the US they couldn't support me with any warranty, and to go check witn US Samsung, which I previously asked and was told to go to Samsung UK, so I got in that loop, hence leaving my phone without any warranty no matter what country I am. I just lost my $700 usd I spent in this item!!!! Samsung Galaxy S3 has been having lots of hardware problems, to fix mine will cost $500 usd to replace the motherboard not worth it!!! WARNING!!!Check for "Samsung Galaxy S3 Sudden Death Syndrome" before considering to buy this phone.                    First of all, I bought from Wireless Everything. I was very pleased with them, it came sealed and great customer service as well.Well, I used have the HTC EVO 3D from Sprint. Which it was my first smartphone. I simply hated my EVO 3D, dropping calls... Keep rebooting all the time, and not built in great materials.So, I canceled my plan with SPRINT (terrible signal in San Diego), and I decide that I needed to have a great phone for the next couple years.Samsung Galaxy S3 seemed the right choice. I have to tell to you I have no regret about buying these handset for $699... Good point is unlocked... So you are free.The S3 is fast with Exynos 4212 Quad (CPU Quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A9) plus the great camera... Also, the GT-I9300 doesn't have bloatware from the carriers, which you can't uninstall but only if you root.I have T-MOBILE now, valued plan. And I know I am getting EDGE 2G, which I was thinking if was a good call. SO contact the T-mobile customer Service. and I got really good news!!!"T-Mobile's Network Modernization. New equipment will be installed in 400 GSM/HSPA+ sites by the end of June that will enable HSPA+ in the 1900 MHz band. Over 2,500 sites will have the new equipment installed by end of July. " From T-mobile specialist. Which means you be getting 4G on the Gt-I9300 very soon!! You don't need to ripped off by At&T!The reason that T-mobile are doing this only now, because At&T failed to buy T-mobile not being approved by the government. T-mobile wouldn't spend a penny... at that time they were going to use the At&t system.So, now T-mobile doesn't want to stay behind by the rivals. Which is great. Which means T-Mobile will announce the IPHONE as well working on 1900 mhz band.I am sure that S3 will be working amazingly fast very on T-mobile.Great phone! Great to keep for a lot of years for sure!                    I was always a fan of Android operated phones, but decided to purchase an iPhone in April of this year because I wanted to try out something different. Let's be honest, years worth of iHype had convinced me that the iPhone was where it's at, and I needed to "get with the times".Typically, I'll keep a phone for at least a year before I decide to upgrade. I believe it's preposterous to constantly waste hard-earned money for the sake of technological acclivity. But, over four months after my initiation into "Team Apple", I couldn't possibly handle any more. I just couldn't.The Samsung Galaxy S3 is wonderful in all definitions of the term. What I, personally, enjoy most is the ability to customize nearly anything and everything. Hate the default font? You could change it. Tired of the standard SMS theme? You could change it. And... brace yourself... you don't need to jailbreak it in order to tweak it to your liking. If you can't customize the phone as much as you'd like by changing the settings, there are many apps that can assist you... apps that the "App Store" fails to offer.Overall, the phone is very smooth. From the ease of navigating the touch screen (which is proven difficult with several phones) to the availability of awesome features and apps, Samsung hit it out of the park. Whether you've been a "lifelong" Android fan or if you've never even held a smartphone aside from the iFail, the Galaxy s3 is for you. At this point, I'll never turn back.EDIT (12/19/12):I've owned this phone for a little over three months now. Unfortunately, I was forced to demote this product  from a 5 star technological masterpiece to a 1 star piece of junk. This is the PV2 of cellphones. After about two months of owning the phone, the battery life gradually became shorter and shorter. Mind you, I have never downloaded more than 5 outside applications on this phone. I have never stored more than 50 pictures. I have never even dropped this device. I basically use the phone for calling/text messages only.Even if I applied the "power saving" option and kept the phone in my handbag for the majority of the day, the battery would only last 5 hours tops. Then when I went to charge it, it would take 8-10 hours to obtain a full (100%) charge. Are you serious, Samsung? My iPhone takes 30 minutes to charge. Last night, I left my phone on the charger (I have about 5 chargers, so it's not the USB itself) overnight and woke up to an 80% charge.I was a bit unimpressed with the frequent crashes, also. It seemed as if this phone would crash at least once or twice per week.With all said, I was becoming angry at how this phone functioned. I ended up calling Verizon and switching back to the iPhone 4, which now seems like a work of art compared to the S3.                    UPDATE 5/03/2013: Just read a post elsewhere where someone said Android was only good for web,email, and stupid games. I chuckled to myself and replied...Seriously? I'm not saying Android can do everything, but in the last three hours (while doing other stuff) I used my S3 to look up the current exchange rate for USD to GBP, updated an associate's excel spreadsheet to use the current exchange rate in several formulas, edited a professional four track audio file to delete an unneeded intro and shorten the song to the desired length and moved the key up two semitones and mixed it down to 2track stereo, then used it to drive from one part of Caracas to another using real time traffic updates to avoid the fabled traffic jams, here. If all one wants to do is web, email and games, why buy an Android product?+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++The unlocked international version that Yapper provides is just what I was looking for. I'll talk first about the not-so-obvious reasons why this phone is the best in the world. I love traveling and can't imagine being stuck with a stupid US model that only works with one US provider. This phone works great with TMobile and ATT in the US, and all of the GSM providers that the rest of the world uses... no roaming! Battery life is way better than my iphone, but even better is the peace of mind you get with being able to swap out the battery with a fresh one if you can't get a charge for a couple of days. (Yes, I can get a couple of days from the battery while the iphone can't even get one day!) The same USB cable you use to charge with is also the data cable that plugs right into the USB port of any computer (or tablet), allowing you to share files with the phone's memory or sd card. You can't do that with an iphone. Of course, you can also swap out the sd card, giving you yet another way to share files with others or simply add storage... can't do that with an iphone, either. I've only had this phone since mid June, but already I've helped out others several times by turning on the wifi hotspot feature that let them see my phone as a wifi hotspot and use my cell data connection for their laptops and tablets. These are a few of the not-so-obvious things this phone can do that others can't. The obvious things that make this phone the best include the big, beautiful screen, incredibly light weight and thinness, speed, buttery smoothness, availability of apps and no need for a computer or itunes! Finally, a real life example. We were driving near Seattle, trying to make three appointments in scattered locations that involved two ferry crossings (not realizing what that means in summer on a Friday!!)  While I was driving, she was using the the GS3 to check the web for ferry schedules at different locations, get upates on wait times, comparing alternative drive times, making calls, finding the nearest gas, and getting driving directions to three places we had never been before. As Friday traffic closed in around us (can you imagine how much traffic on a beautiful summer Friday in the Puget Sound?) we were able to avoid overloaded ferries, drive our way into reverse commutes avoiding miles-long backups, circumnavigated Puget Sound and made all three appointments. At the end of the day as we rode the last ferry across Puget Sound, she looked at her unused iphone, put it in the glove compartment and said, "Wow! That was amazing to use the GS3. I can't go back to using an iphone, now... I couldn't have done all that in time." After a beat she chuckled and added, "Just all the pinching and zooming would have driven me nuts!"                    This phone is fantastic. It feel great in the hand and pocket, despite the immense screen size. The software is incredibly fast and smooth although the "IOS rip off" crowd does have a case on a few of its features. Regardless, the phone runs great, is very powerful and battery length is quite good due to the large battery (easily lasts 24 hours of light to moderate use). The bootloader is factory unlocked and works without issue on multiple SIMs on USA AT&T. It is important to note, however, that the quad-core exynos chip will not support US LTE bands so beware before you buy.                    This phone is really great and coming from the HTC G2 to this was an easy transition. It's very user friendly. However with t-mobile, it will only work on edge not 3g or 4g; didn't know that. However, I returned the phone and I knew there would be a restocking fee applied, but $55 is unnecessarily steep and considering the return address is someone's house is a little ridiculous. Won't be ordering from this seller again.
!###This phone is great- I like the speed of pages loading on wi-fi.  It is a much better web browser than my old Droid X, because of the bigger screen and sharper resolution.  I love the camera- especially the burst mode.  Reviewers say it is not as bright as screens in other state of the art phones, but it is bright enough for me.  Be sure to put on a protective case right away, as this phone is very slippery and slim. In only  2 days, I have already dropped it 3x. It likes to slide off tables, too.  BTW, for the fashion conscious, the pebble blue is only blue on the outer rim- the back and front surfaces are a dark metallic pewter that favorably belies its plastic composition. It looks ritzier than the plain black or white.  I got the T-Mobile version and have not used the 4g much, so I can't comment on network quality.  The first full charge on the battery only lasted 12 hours, but I did have wi-fi on the whole time.  I got it for $99 direct from T-Mobile on a one day sale- they will probably run the sale again on their site.  Generally I prefer Motorola phones for their ruggedness, but for the price I could not pass this up (case will make up for it.)                    This is the best phone I have ever owned - of the six I have had over a lifetime (three Blackberry, three Android). I would be hard pressed to think of any serious complaints. If anything, it is a large phone. However, you know that going into it. As for battery life, all LTE phones suffer from less than stellar battery life. I don't find the S3 any worse than others. In fact, better than my Rezound.I bought this phone outright, out of contract. I don't regret one dime of what I spent. I doubt even the new iPhone will beat it (even though it will finally have an updated look, same tired OS).LOVE IT!                    I own a Galaxy Nexus - the Google phone - and love it. I'd give that one about 4.5 stars, but we are not talking about that phone.Anyway, my wife needed a phone and was upgrading from the original Droid that she hated and could never really figure out. I was tempted to get her another Nexus, but figured I'd splurge and try this one out since it's the big thing right now.Wow. What a great device. It does everything the Nexus does, with a little more pizazz.My wife, who was afraid of the phone going in - she thought it would be too techy for her especially after her Droid experience - absolutely LOVES it. Right off she was figuring out things for herself and settling right in.Now, I could quibble about the size of the phone. It's even bigger than the Nexus, which I find a bit large. However, if you are buying the phone, I will assume you know how big it is.The large size makes it solid for texting and browsing, but it is noticeable in your pocket.Still, the size is there for a reason. If you want a big screen, then you can't complain about the size, can you.The latest version of Android has petty much closed the gap with iOS. Dead simple and very intuitive.                    I ordered this phone a couple weeks ago as a gift for my boyfriend and I am quite happy. The package came on time and was exactly what it was supposed to be. And the phone, amazing! Super-fast, ridiculously clean graphics and just overall awesome. I had a really hard time handing it over and am considering getting one myself. People have been labeling it the iPhone killer. I wouldn't necessarily go that far as to say it kills the iPhone but its certainly giving it a run for its money! Definitely get this phone if you're considering it.                    First foray into ICS - never going back to IOS.  This phone is awesome.  Size can be a bit unwieldy, but it is FAST, FAST, FAST.                    This is my first Android phone and I've only had it 36 hours....I ordered the Samsung I9300 and was very concerned about how I would get the phone up and running with less time than my last unlocked phone.  As with all unlocked phones, internet and MMS require manual setup when not locked to a carrier. Took me two days on a weekend to figure the settings out with my previous unlocked phone, Sony Ericcson Satio.This seller included instructions on how to change the language AND set up a new APN. I was up and running after 5 minutes (not including phone charging time, of course). Two thumbs up for including the settings.Packaging was very complete and as promised, new. Never been opened. I went to the AT&T store to purchase a case and all of the reps there were just drooling over this phone. The weight, the color (pebble blue), the graphics, the response to touch.Definitely worth the price.All-in-all I would recommend this seller, products and shipper (Fullfilled by Amazon). Everything went very smoothly and I am a very happy customer.                    First, you sell this phone as a Samsung Galaxy S III (GT-I9300)... but that's not what I got. I received a package with a double precint, I mean two Samsung stickers. When I opended th phone and started to check it out, the battery cover has a scratch a the protective plastic cover was removed and re attached. Ok... let me check if the phone works... When it started up, and I started to check the apps, I saw a SuperSU and a Chinese app among others apps. Why this phone is rooted and have a chinese app? Also, It couldn't update via OTA. Just to be sure, I rebooted on download mode the phone, and WOW! a surprise, the Phone model is a SGH-i747 (AT&T exclusive SGSIII).This is just a joke as a seller, I bought two of this phones, and they both have the same characteristics.You should never buy a phone from On the Go                    I got an iPhone after a cheap Android and could not handle the switch.  The iPhone is attractive and has high-quality hardware and feel, but I really do think the Android software is better AS LONG AS you mind taking the time to get it set up -- and this will require you to be something of a sleuth to uncover all the apps and user forums that will enable you to get things running just as YOU want them to.  Once done however, that's the big draw (to me) of having an Android phone -- it will run the way YOU want it to,.  iPhones just do as Apple tells them and if you want something different, well, tough toenails!A few pros and cons about this phone:-- Setup and syncing are not perfect with an iPhone either.  You'd think that would be true, but it's not.  Having said that, like I said already, you will have to put a LOT of effort into getting an Android phone the way you want it.  Especially if you are technologically challenged like me.  I'm at two months and counting.....-- You can get an app that will back up your text messages to &#34;conversation view&#34; in Gmail.  This is great if you ever have important information in there that you need to look up via computer or if you have to change phones.  There is no way to do this from an iPhone.-- Ease of use, for example the &#34;back&#34; button is hard-wired into the phone so in any app it's in the same place.  You can also organize all the icons on your home screens any way you want them (iPhone snaps them all back in place on the grid so this cannot be done).-- Contacts' pictures show up next to text messages, when calls come in and in my phone address book.  (It's the little things, but still!)-- The size of the phone is really quite ridiculous.  It's not any heavier than the iPhone and although it's skinner, the length and width are so big that a number of accessories can't accommodate it (so far I have had that experience with car stereo hookup devices and non-armband pockets/holders for the gym).  This is due in part to my keeping it in a water-resistant Ballistic case, but let's face it, at $300+ you wouldn't want anything bad to happen to it so I don't feel like I have any choice.  At least you will always be able to find it in a purse, but just be aware that your iPhone friends will pick on you for dragging half a laptop computer around!-- By far my biggest problem with this phone has been how freaking difficult it has been to get music transferred from my mac computer/iTunes to the phone!!!!!!  I finally got iSync to work, but on some forums they claim that it is a known issue that the Galaxies unmount micro SD cards all by themselves and then the data on the cards is lost forever.  Yes, I can tell you that it took several hours to sync music to my phone and most maddening, when that was finally done everything would disappear if for any reason I had to restart the phone.  Also, some playlists would not sync so I would end up with about half the music I had originally wanted.  Then upon trying to actually play them, I would get an error message saying  that the file type I was trying to play was not supported, which is interesting because I converted all of the songs to MPEG Audio format before I put them on my phone, just to be safe.  Thank goodness I finally realized that all of these problems are probably stemming from the manufacturer, not by my phone itself, so now I can try to get things resolved through the seller of the $20 SD card instead of the seller of the $300+ phone.-- The phone supposedly has a known issue with some exFAT external ED cards unmounting themselves; it is not clear what, if anything, Samsung plans to do to fix this.  &#62;:(-- The Siri equivalent doesn't work too well (runs through Google), although I never could get Siri herself to do much either so I suppose this should be counted as a tie between the two.-- The battery seems to die a lot quicker, even from a full charge.I apologize for this review being so long and mostly pointing out the benefits and drawbacks only of Android vs. iOS.  However, I have never owned a smart phone before so I wouldn't be able to make a similarly detailed comparison between them.  I do know that the Galaxy and the HTC One are probably the top most popular choices and I'm thinking there must be some pretty good reasons for that!  Anyway, I am happier with mine than I was and I am glad the card problem didn't originate with the actual phone.  Wish me luck and try a Galaxy yourself -- you might like it too!                    absolutely the worst, ive ordered alot of stuff from amazon and this is the only product defective! i ordered a new phone and i received a used and refurbished phone. Not cool.
!###They ship the phone as if you bought it out the store. Hate the fact that when you buy it unlocked none of the guides (on paper) are in english. The phone itself is awesome works great I love it! NICE JOB                    The phone seems to be great.....but I have not been able to obtain a micro sims card for my factory unlocked Samsung Galaxy S 111, since purchasing. My intentions in paying full price for the phone was to cancel my current cell phone provider, going to a straight talk plan. Cutting my monthly payment in half made the expense worth it. At this time, all I did was get a phone I can not use to get onto a straight talk plan. I need a micro sims card and phone service for the Adirondacks area code 12032 for unlimited talk, unlimited text and unlimited data if anyone can help me please!!!                    The GIII was interesting to explore, but ultimately was of little practical use given its quirks and Android bugs! So I returned it and got an iPhone 5 from the same IP. JACKPOT! This is the phone the GIII should have been.                    ok.. . ..... ... ... ... .. .... ... .. .... .. ..... .... ..... .... . ... ... ..ok                    I bought this unlocked phone while overseas. I loved it at first. I'm a diehard BB fan. I've been using BB ever since it came out back in the days. I wanted a change and I chose the S 3. I've had it for a month now. But a week ago it started to charge slowly, I mean vey slowly approx. 3-4 hrs for a full charge. I was ok with that but couple of days later it started to take more time for a full charge 6-7 hrs from 15%. Now that is not ok because lets be honest who has that much time to keep the phone on charger. I also noticed that the phone sometimes get stuck at specific % for an hour or more. I looked up the issue on the web and apparently I wasn't the only person complaining about this problem. So many people are having the same issue with charging time.Samsung has done a good job with the big screen and phone shape and weight including functionality. But when it comes down to practicality they failed in my department. I honestly can't wait to go back to BB when the new BB10 is released sometimes next year.I'm surprised this phone is being praised so highly on amazon. It sure doesn't deserve the 4 stars.                    Hiya! One questions doyou really know if  the phone working in other country for example Argentina .Its really unlocked and  I'm going to be able call  here mobile phone company are movistar  and personal .If you can  research I'll be thankful.Nestor                    Even if you are the middle person you must still sell the product by telling the consumers all that they need to know do not just take the item as face value.  There were some things on this item that was not mentioned in the selling points that were important and with that being said is why this item was returned.  Liked it or not all of the information was not given before purchase.  And the restocking fees are ridiculas, any store still gets there money with the box open or not no moneies are lost.  I will buy this item but from some one else who will tell all that is needed to know not when i receive it.  So for this I give this company a low 2 stars                    I AM REALLY SORRY THAT MY SIM CARD DID NOT FIT THE SLOT.  MY SIM CARD IS LARGE AND THE SIII SLOT IS FOR A SMALL SIZE SIM CARD.  ALSO, THE PACKAGE ONLY INCLUDES A UK ADAPTOR, NO OTHER ADAPTERS, LIKE FOR U. S. OR EUROPE.  I EMAILED THE SELLER AND REQUESTED A REPLACEMENT SIII THAT WOULD FIT MY SIM CARD.  THEY REPLIED FOR ME TO CALL FOR TECH. SERVICE TO FIX MY PROBLEM.  I HOPE THAT I CAN HAVE A SMALLER SIM CARD MADE TO FIT THE SLOT BY MY CELL PHONE SERVICE PROVIDER.THE SIII DOES APPEAR TO BE A GREAT PHONE.  I HOPE THAT I CAN GET THE SIM CARD PROBLEM RESOLVED.                    I got this phone in September. I had a blackberry with the raised keyboard but thought it was time to upgrade. I use my blackberry for everything. My to do lists, memos, calendar, contacts-personal and my business contacts and some pictures. The only thing I have been able to transfer over were my contacts-which are now copied twice and my pictures. All my calendar info did not copy over. I went on line with the goggle calendar & wasn't able to sync my outlook calendar that was perfectly on my blackberry & desk top. I have tried 3 times. My calendar included my yearly to do list, birthdays, household maintance tasks -like recycling. My memo list had wines I liked, books I want to read, books I read, business ideas, info on clients. The verizon store person told me I have to re-enter the info by hand. Someone else told me to try Radio shack & they might be able to transfer the info... I just need to find the time. The picture quality is good but I have 2 great cameras so I really don't care about the camera. The size is much bigger that the balck berry and I realize I prefer the smaller lighter black berry. Also the key pad had the automatic speller- it took me one week to decide to change that setting to off. I do NOT like the touch key pad, I spend more time retyping the entire sentence in order to correct one letter of a mispelled word. I can't get the cursor to go in the position I want. I had someone tell me this phone can open my garage door-that's what I have a garage door opener for. Just give me back my calender and memo's that made my life run smoother.  I am seriously considering getting a different phone. For me it doesn't match my needs. So my advice to others is think about your needs before purchasing this phone. Ask what transfers over at the store where you buy it.
!###I feel totally ripped off, the phone is repaired and sell it at a high price, the phone I received powder gets to the screen, you will damage the load pin is totally an abuse because in any momeno specify that the phone is repaired.This seller should get out of here because it leaves very badly amazon.You do not respond or give guarantees, is a total abuse.                    I had bought this phone used from a seller called &#34;Sale_MS&#34;Although it does work, the phone I received was no more than a Chinese clone of the Galaxy S3. I discovered this when at first it could not be detected by my computer and only had 2GB of storage space. Second, the dead-giveaway was the Android version. The phone I received was running Android Version 4.1.9! This version is not a real licensed Android version! Make sure you don't buy a fake phone and have to waste your time *trying* to get it returned. If you are buying used, make sure you contact your seller beforehand!                    the galaxy s 3 phone that I received was not working, does not take a charge and the screen was cracked. that is to much money to spend on a defective product like that one.                    This is not a GT- I9300, this seller it's taking us for fools!(No es un GT-I9300, este vendedor no est&aacute; tomando por idiotas!)Don't buy this if you don't want to have issues and problems! I'm an engineer and I assure you all that this is not an original GT-I9300, it's just a SGH-I747. This guy is selling this as a I9300 because he wants to sell more.. IT'S JUST FALSE ADVERTISING!!No compre esto si no quieres tener problemas! Soy ingeniero y puedo asegurarles que no es un GT-I9300 original, es simplemente la versi&oacute;n americana SGH-I747. Este tipo est&aacute; vendiendo esto como un GT-I9300 para tratar de vender m&aacute;s - ES S&Oacute;LO FALSA PUBLICIDAD!!).                    It was for the first time that I did not pay enough attention to the reviews for this seller and &#34;was happen also to me&#34;.I received a fake product. It did not work ok from the start but did not realize that is a fake samsung. The serial number on the telephone was different from the serial number on the case and I saw this only after a personel from a service point from one of mobile carrier show me.I send back and the story has a happy end - I received back all the money from Amazon.                    This Samsung Galaxy S3 on the Verizon Network was my 3rd smartphone I've used and I chose this over 2 other competitors phones and I regret it. On the surface, professional reviews and many personal reviews don't cover this phones shortfalls. I'm sure you can read all the gush and glory elsewhere so I'll just get to my issues with the GS3 that I've used for 6 months now.1. Erratic notification sounds. You think all is normal but oops, you got a message and did not get a sound notification. Happens all the time with this phone. I use the one, basic, general notification tone for all my notifications, nothing complicated but you just can't trust that you'll get that sound every time.2. DTMF tones are a joke. Ever have to do phone banking or place an order, maybe call customer service and push buttons to answer questions before you talk to a person? This is also hit or miss with the GS3. I even called samsung customer service once for another product and their own IVR would not recognize the  poor quality tones produced by this phone. Wondering what was going on one day, I called my home phone from the GS3 and typed in a few numbers and there it was, the sound quality of the tones are very poor - like a worn out cassette tape recording from the 70s, really. Talk about a massive failure of such a basic phone function is really just not excusable.3. Lock screen behavior. I use the pattern lock screen for some basic security but what a hassle. Get a call, the screen locks, go to hang up, the screen locks, go to hit a button for input, the screen locks, I mean, don't you think if there is ANYTHING going on with a call that the lock screen would be, like, disabled? Noooooooo, it's gonna pop up when you least expect it to really make your life miserable. Now I'm using the Samsung lock screen and have checked and adjusted all the possible settings to keep this behavior from happening but it still does.4. Automatic Network switching. may sound complicated but it's a basic smartphone function to minimize data charges, the phone will use wireless networks within range for data transfer. Problem is, this phone won't let go of a poor wireless data connection in favor of a 3G or 4G connection. Samsung keeps saying they're gonna fix it but it's been about a year now and it's still an issue that slows or stops data transfer and literally leaves you hanging.5. Kies and car mode. I read reviews how great these are but in reality, they just don't work or require more work than the benefit. Kies is Samsung file transfer. It's not intuitive and complicated to set up. Car mode worked once where it read a text message after I tinkered with it (while driving), Thank Samsung for making driving safer! Just turning it on/off doesn't do it.6. Samsung Techtiles, These are little Near Field Communication stickers (that you can actually purchase anywhere for a much lower price) that manipulate many settings on the phone. yeah, in theory it's a nice idea but in practice, half the time it doesn't read the tile, sometimes it miss-reads a tile. A prime example of technology that just doesn't work properly. While we're on the NFC topic, the commercial showing that you can "bump" two phones together and transfer data is outright misleading. In short, that bump is at least 2 seconds and then it can take upward of a minute or more to get the file transferred.7. Battery life. Yeah, I'm going there! I'm not a heavy game player but I do use the calendar function often. That big fancy screen and whatever else is drawing the juice, puts the battery in the red zone certainly by the end of the work day.The GS3 does have a really nice camera.That's it, if you can live with these shortcomings, great, if you think you can't then I would say don't take my word for it, go test it out for yourself and see what I'm talking about. Good luck!                    I purchased my phone through "Open Group Wireless" fulfilled by Amazon. I have an Amazon store card and with that comes interest free payments on certain monetary amounts. I believe (not looking) that for anything over $300.00, there is a one year interest free payment plan on that item, or that particular purchase. If you purchase other items post, that transaction, they will not be included in your previous interest free deal, so keep that in mind if you choose to use the Store card and make sure to double check card conditions with Amazon on purchases over a certain amount.On big ticket items, I only buy from a vendor that Amazon backs, because returns are less of an issue and I believe the company is safer and more legitimate when fulfilled by Amazon. I once bought a sheet set from a vendor not fulfilled through amazon and everything stated about sheets online was a lie. The actual packaging said "LIKE- 800 count Egyptian cotton" but the vendor neglected to put "like" in the description and when I wrote a "buyer beware" review, I received lots of nasty gram emails demanding that I remove my unflattering review. I believe someone even called me and was nasty to me. I now choose very carefully,who I do business with on Amazon. They cannot police every company or individual who wants to sell, but the ones they do back, I have never had a problem with. I have read reviews about Galaxy 3 phones (not backed by amazon) having been opened, seal broken, because seller stated they needed to put the unlock code on the phone. This is not true, if the phone is a legitimate International Unlocked cell no one needs to "add the code", and avoid these sellers if you read anything about them needing to "add unlock code". I've purchased 3 unlocked Samsungs and never has there been a seal broken. The phones are unlocked, brand new, never used, from factory and only reason someone would open phone to "add" unlock code, is because it is a used phone that is specific to a particular company. For example, If the phone was an ATT phone and you want to use Tmobile, Tmobile needs the ATT code in order to provide service to that phone. All of the non contracted start ups allow for customers to bring their own phones and in the instructions it states that the unlock code from the previous phone company is needed. That is why a seller is putting the unlock code on the phone.OPEN GROUP WIRELESS has true, unlocked International, warrantied, phones and when you are paying more than $500.00 for a cell phone, that is exactly what you want. I read reviews about bad batteries, movie data already loaded on the phone (that means it was someone else's phone before you got it), batteries that were not even factory issue, bad chargers, inability to switch language, advertised as an International unlocked, but was not, and a plethora of other issues. If you receive the phone and seal is broken, taped over, don't do anything to it, except return it, because you will have an issue with that phone, it is NOT brand new, and it is not what it was advertised to be. If you go with the companies that Amazon backs, you will be fine. I paid a little more for that security and I have no regrets. My phone arrived by the date it was promised, It was not opened, box was completely factory sealed and changing language from German to English was as easy as instructions stated.I have purchased unlocked International cell phones before, so I knew that they were adaptable to contract and non contracted services and I've used them on both plans. After researching and reading that others went the Straight Talk route with the Galaxy 3, that was my plan.The cool thing about non contracted services is that you pay around $50.00 for a month of unlimited, everything service, and if one company does not serve well, pay another $50.00 to check out another company, until you find the one that provides best service to your area- it is still cheaper than being stuck in a contract.In the Straight Talk start up kit, there are 3 sim cards, a larger one, then ATT and Tmobile . ATT (as I was told by rep), has a mini sim  for the Galaxy 3, but  having already read that others trimmed the card down that came in the kit,  I did same and have no problems. I put both ATT and Tmobile sim cards in my phone and should have went with the Tmobile because I get better service in my home, but when I was speaking with the rep, I could not get the sim card to stop popping out. She said it may need trimmed some more. She also said if I was able to get it to stay, all I needed to do was call them back, switch sim serial numbers and then go through the process of APNs, in order to get data. Here is where some aggravation may come in. There are not enough categories on the Straight Talk APN webpage for the Galaxy 3 to get internet working, so I had to call for help, this could require patience. No matter what time of day I called, or that I tried again the following day, it took me half a day to finally be able to leave a call back. Just about every time I called, the recording said,  "there was an unusually large volume of calls" and they could not take mine, then click. When I did get through, the recording said  call back was 30 minutes, it was nearly 2 hours, but when I finally got a warm body around 8:30 PM, she stayed on the phone with me until I had internet. It took some trial and error to finally get it. I complained to her, that the website was not well equipped and about the long time in which it took to speak with someone, and she apologized. She said that the company was aware and they were taking steps to improve customer service.  The one thing I wish I had, that didn't come with phone, but which is downloadable, is a users guide. A quick start, manual was included in phone packaging, with details on how to access owners guide and I will take the time to do that, for I am not savvy in the smart phone world to know the full capabilities of this phone.The phone uses like a tablet, so I am familiar with how to obtain apps etc.. I love the large screen, the options, and the camera takes great pics. The one thing to remember is that if there are apps continuously running in the background, that will suck battery incredibly fast (learned that in one day). As for factory issued battery- I text for a couple of hours in the evenings, post pics, text off and on during the day, access internet, and check my email. At end of  an average day I can be anywhere from 67%-40% available battery usage. I charge it every night. The better battery will be a future investment.The key to a happy phone experience, is to buy from the right vendor first and foremost. What I discovered about the reviews, is that they are all grouped together and it is difficult to know which vendor a review is about, unless author mentions it. One can click on vendor, be directed to their page and then see reviews specific to them. That can take a very long time. There are also vendors who operate under more than one company name. BEWARE of these vendors. Amazon is my favorite place to shop and I do a lot of business with them. I may not be a savvy smart phone user, but I am a savvy, well informed shopper and do not jump for the cheapest price on amazon. Do the research, know what an unlocked International cell is supposed be before you buy. Contact seller to see if they need to add an "unlock code" to the phone you are considering to purchase. I wrote a vendor to ask why they operated under more than one (at least 3) company name. No reply. It is as simple as this, International unlocked under warranty, does exist. I have one, love my galaxy 3, got exactly what I was told I was getting- a brand new, straight from the factory cell phone. I got it from Open group wireless, fulfilled by amazon.                    My SGS3 was very good, but all of sudden I got the Sudden death syndrome, I'm having problems with the warranty, since I live in Mexico and Samsung wont help because I don't have a receipt with the IMEI on it.Dont buy this product because the warranty dont works                    The Galaxy SIII is a direct competitor to the iPhone 5. It is in many respects superior to the iPhone but because of the many versions of phones using Android OS, the Android OS lags behind in apps that do audio like guitar amp simulaton software. I expect that it will catch up soon. The larger screen is a big plus for me. It's sharp, bright and the colors accurate and well saturated. The 8 Megapixel camera is as good as many point shoot stand alone cameras. This thing is solid and can take licking. I haven't tried it myself but if you look up the torture test on Cnet's "Always On" program with Molly Wood. You'll see that this thing can take a beating. All in all, it is an impressive phone.                    This phone is very good! I have the international version and it's really amazing! I highly recommend this phone! Cheers!
!###Please, before you buy this phone be aware that when (not if) it fails, you are left with a $455 paper weight. There is a very, very common charging port issue with this phone. Do a search on the web, the online forums are bursting with people with the same problem. I had it for exactly 57 days, not even a scratch or a ding on it. I loved it, took great care of it, but it failed anyway.Not Samsung nor World Wide Distributors will do any help whatsoever. I didn't even want a new one, I wanted this one to get fixed. World Wide Distributors says it's Samsungs problem, since their 30 day warranty its expired and I'm SOL. Samsung says it's World Wilde Distributors problem, since they sold the phone on the US they are the ones that should fix it. After going back and forth for about 7 days they want the phone shipped to the UK, to see if it can get fixed.Say what? Spend another $100 and ship the phone to the other side of the planet? Wait 3 to 6 months and they're not even sure it will get fixed? I'd rather have them be honest and tell me to shove it up my rear end. Plainly put, there isn't and won't be support for this phone, ever.You're better off buying a phone from a major brand name store, whichever you prefer. Don't make the same mistake I did. Serves me right for trusting Samsung and World Wide Distributors.                    I bought a ORIGINAL  samsung  SIII and  you sent me the Samsung SIII Chinese version so I need the return of my money!The ORIGINAL samsung SIII is made in Corea not in China.                    Review from Mike's Wife:I've had this phone for 6 weeks and wish I had gone with the Motorolla.  Eveyone I talked to said that this phone had the next best camera to the iPhone and that is pretty much the only reason that I didn't go with the Motorolla Droid Maxx HD (which does have gorilla glass).What I do like about this phone: the talk to text for text messaging and email is awesome! You dictate the message, including the punctuation, which has saved me so much time.  The swipe to type is okay but not great (the talk to text is better).  The camera and videos are nice.  The phone is fast and has a nice, large screen.Now, for what I don't like: the screen broke from a fall of only 3 feet!!  I practically threw my old Motorola Droid (first edition) and dropped it from multiple heights onto tile, concrete and macadam and the screen NEVER broke or scratched!  My Husband has the Droid three and same story, dropped many times without problems.  I also don't like that this phone doesn't always auto rotate.  When I have it in the car mount, the home screen does not orient to horizontal but most of the apps will when they are open.  The phone doesn't have a "driving mode" like the Motorola and does not "play" as well with all the Google functions as my old phone.  when you are in the text mode, if you turn the phone horizontally you can barely see the a single line of the text message that you are trying to replay to.  The email app that comes on the phone, sucks and even the wireless guy said "don't bother".  I use the yahoo and gmail apps instead.If you get this phone be sure to get insurance on it from day one.                    Screen is large, but too bulky for pocket. Battery life has not been that great. Bluetooth seems buggy at times. The good is that it is reasonably fast browsing.                    I want to make it clear that this phone is technologically AMAZING. It has so many awesome features, the screen is incredible, the camera is top notch for a phone camera, and the software... while sometimes a little laggy... is easy to use. I'm not going into specifics about all the cool stuff you can do with the S3 because there are tons of reviews here that do it for me. I agree with them! All of them.MY issue with the S3 is something I wish I had been told before I purchased the phone. Had I been told, I probably would have opted for something different... aka the I5. (Even though I freaking hate all things Apple... they make repairs affordable and easy!) My S3 made it less than a month before I shattered the screen. Typically this would be a time where I bemoan my timing (my otterbox came in the mail about two days after this incident) and curse my clumsy nature BUT the fact that I was sitting in a fully carpeted room (it's actually extra padded carpet because it's a classroom designed for toddlers under two year of age) in a chair designed for a preschooler... it might not even be 12 inches off the ground (not very comfortable but HEY! I needed to sit down to paint with the kiddo's!)...the fact that the screen was completely shattered from top to bottom after taking a tumble of maybe 14 inches onto a padded carpet... WELL! I mean what do you say? The salesperson at Verizon told me about this "gorilla glass" stuff and made it seem like the designers of the S3 had taken the fact that screens break all the time into account. I just want to know what kind of gorillas Samsung is basing their strength tests off of. I mean honestly?So anyways, I didnt have insurance (yeah I know.. boo and hiss to me for not being prepared) but I didnt have insurance because I A. Treated the thing like it was a newborn baby B. expected to have it protected by the big bad otter box and C. I haven't ever dropped/broke a phone so I didnt even think about it when I was researching which phone to upgrade to. So I call Verizon and they're pretty much like "Sorry, you're SOL." I call all around the Atlanta area looking for an independent repair shop... every quote I get is over $300... for a SCREEN! When I dropped it, I was upset, but I figured since the touch screen still worked that it was just the surface glass that needed repair and it wouldnt cost much at all. Wrong. Samsung has made it incredibly easy to replace the screen of this phone by selling the LCD/glass/digitizer as a pre-attached piece. Aka... even though just the glass broke, you can't replace JUST the glass. I mean maybe some super hi-tech adrenaline junkie could do it with some super fancy tools... but no professional would. Being friends with a few tech savvy people I think to myself "I'll just go buy this silly hi-tech screen part and have someone smart fix it! Parts are always cheap, right?" Wrong. Amazon, ebay, ect ect... every screen replacement part was either a blatant rip off or cost over $250. SO I finally call Samsung (I waited to call them last because I figured their repair would take forever and it would be super expensive... it ended up being $180 so not SO bad but still...) and I get the order processed and all goes well. The repair is awesome and everything is just like new. However, I feel like this phone was made to make Samsung's repair technicians jobs easier and they didn't take the customer into account at all. Surely a screen breaking is the most common issue with all cell phones so I dont understand why any company who has the consumer in mind would make it so expensive to do what should be a simple repair. It kind of blows my mind.Not a week later, a friend of mine also broke her phone. Only she had it in a case! And it broke IN her pocket. She had insurance and had to pay $90 (not including tax or shipping)to get a whole new phone. Sigh...I don't know. I just feel like they either should've made some gorilla glass that lives up to the name or they should have made repairs more cost effective for their customers.End of story, awesome technology... but I'm not sure if it's worth it for the super flimsy nature of the phone! I shall be wrapping this newly fixed phone in bubble wrap in addition to the otter box and praying that the next time I'm due for an upgrade that they have made bullet proof/shatter proof glass screens. Dreamers will dream eh?                    The product isn't the one as described. Actually the phone is the model AT&T SGH-I747 instead of the international version I9300, as described!                    Everywhere I looked people were carrying or using the new Samsung Galaxy S III phone, so when I went looking for a new smart phone I picked this one for me.  While the phone is stylish and filled with lots of new technology, my experience was disappointing to say the least.  The phone was unconfortable to hold for longer phone calls, too thin along the edges to grip comfortably for me.  The screen was beautiful, put in spite of contantly killing tasks and shutting off wireless, bluetooth and GPS the battery would drain extremely fast.  I was constanly looking for the charger to plug it back in to top the battery off.  Just seemed to be too energy hungry.  Then to top it off it kept locking up and after repeated trips to the cellphone carrier, rebooting it, reactivating it and resetting it to start over from scatch again - 15 minutes later it was locked up once again.  Finally the store ran a diagnostic test and decided to give me another phone to try.  Connectivity on this one seemed to be a bit sub par for both the network and for wireless, maybe it was just my bad luck, but I gave up and got a Motorola Razr Maxx. So far I have been very pleased for all things that smart phones are supposed to be able to do.  The battery life too of this phone is phenominal compared to the Samsung Galaxy S III doing the same things that were draining the Samsung right down.  It is a bit bulkier, but I like the feel, it feels sturdier and with the thicker edge it is easier to hold even though it is a bit heavier with the more powerful battery onboard.  Maybe the looks are not as sleek, but I do not feel like it is going to slip out of my hand as easlily either.  Yes the picture quality is not the same, but if I want to watch HD movies I am not the type to do so on my cellphone either, when there are so many other choices that are so much better than any cellphone.                    hi, i have a simple question?Wich version is this mobile you are offering?1.5 or 1.4?? Dual- core? or Quad-core??ARE YOU SURE? BECAUSE IN THE DESCRIPTIONS IT SAYS THAT IS A DUALCORE, AND I NEED A QUAD CORE BECAUSE I'LL MOVE TO LATIN AMERICA, THANKS                    Both phones freeze, turn off, kick you out of programs, open random programs, internet freezes in a white screen, speaker eco, etc.I have replaced both phones twice now! They are faulty phones t-mobile will only reboot it several times until they send out a replacement. I would stay clear of this phone.                    Because it was not announced that I had to pay 75 Euros custom taxes. Such high costs must be announced in advance.
!###if you arnt a fanboy of apple and actually know much about anything about phones the samsung galaxy s 3 is for you, blazing freaking fast, beautiful screen, great camera, incredible internal specs like 2 gigs of ram and a dual core snapdragon processor running at 1.5 ghz a awesome battery life and all the great features it comes with who wouldnt want this phone.                    Awesome Phone!!!!It is actually unlocked...but...why if it's FACTORY unlocked it comes with Deustche Telekom (German T Mobile) content on it?                    I upgraded to this phone from a Galaxy Nexus, which is also a fantastic phone.  But the S3 is plain sweet!  If you can get this for a good deal, do it.  I got it from Costco for 390 with the value plan.  Overall extremely impressed and happy with the purchase.                    Nice phone, very fast.  I love it, Android operating system is very nice and so fast.  Also the price was good. Arrive on time!                    The phone is very good. Fast, and everything worked as advertised.The only problem is it only worked for 4 months.Went dead for no apparent reason, and there is no procedure do bring it back (doesn't even go into download mode).Neither Samsung Brazil nor USA will honor the warranty, so I am left with an expensive paper weight.Think twice before shelling that much money into a phone with no warranty.                    The included battery in the sealed box doesn't fit in the phone!!! The battery's part number it's correct. so Is the phone or battery counterfeit? There is no back cover protector, and the speaker grill on the back appears dented. The seal sticker on the box was over another sticker. Are these units refurbished or counterfeit? And the only instructions were in Portugues. Is this what they mean by an "international version"?I thought I could buy with confidence since this is fulfilled by Amazon, but obviously there is no quality control and Amazon just stores and ships what ever junk they get sent.                    When I purchased the Samsung galaxy s3 it supposed to have been unlocked, when I received the phone and attempt to have it actived by my carrier they explained that they could not active it because it may have been stolen. So I contacted the seller to report what my carrier (stated that the phone was stolen) the blubell sales wanted me to go into the phone to the unlock the phone because they claim that they missed the unlocking. The reason why I purchased the phone because I wanted a unlocked phone for traveling. I returned the phone, now blubell sales wants to charge me a restocking fee. This was fuse advertising the phone was not as advertise and I don't think I should pay a restocking fee. (I had to purchase another phone because I couldn't active the phone that I purchased from blubell sales) my tips do not get involved with them!!!!!!!!                    Buy this mobile exactly 5 months and a day like any other stopped working. Bring it to a repair center and was told that the main board was burned. Research on the internet and it turns out that the Galaxy S3 have a hardware defect, at 5 months were burning main board. I tell them not to buy this mobile, because it has no warranty, and lose their money, as I now have to buy another, and pay only 5 months ago more than 500USD laying burn that has no warranty. If I had, samsung knows the problem and they changed to a new one, but since it does not, just lost my money. Thanks to this sale. Not lose their money, do not buy this mobile.                    In the title of the publication they said this was a I9300 SAMSUNG GALAXY SIII, but they sent me a SGH-T999 SGS3 in a fake box without the headphones.Is not the same phone, not the same processor. The phone is really good, but even so i'm disapointed.
!###Inside the package was not Celular Commercial invoice, send a picture of it to: inmortaly1990@hotmail.comrequires the purchase invoice to process the shipment please post the purchase invoice                    Phone is fine, but guess what? I can't get it to sync my yahoo mail, and I've tried reinstalling, choosing POP3 or IMAP, etc. It just won't do it. I called Samsung, and they said you have to call the country where the celll phone was made if you want support. That means Europe on this phone. A $600 phone you can't get support on. Good job, Amazon.                    Just buy the product if you really want to loose your money. The phone its a good camera. A lot of bugs.

Read this forum before purchasing a Samsung phone. I have been given the run around by Samsung Support for two weeks now - spending several hours on hold and having 1 Supervisor tell me that "Maybe a software update might come through in the near future to remedy my issue" (Really Samsung??)[...]After weeks of dealing with Samsung they finally replaced my phone.  I think there was an issue with certain phones, so far the new phone has not cracked.  I would still be cautious.                    I've been frustrated with this phone since I bought it in September due to spotty coverage and streaming capabilities.  It will frequently show low or no signal in places where my Blackberry (on the same network) does fine.  Last straw occurred yesterday when it died because a small amount of sweat seeped into the case while I was running with the phone in an armband.  The phone was completely destroyed.I've owned this phone for less than two months.  It should not have allowed water incursion in the first place, and the drop or two that did get in should not have caused a complete meltdown.  Terrible durability, and I now find that it's worthless for one of the primary reasons I purchased the phone.Strong recommendation against.  I should have bought an iPhone.                    I just got the phone and it doesn't charge at all it did at first and now nothing . and the product was stated new but the box was not celephan wrapped. and looks kind of old looking. the phone it self looks great but if I can't charge it. it does me no good
!###I already had some pretty high expectations when purchasing the GS3.  I had heard great things, but I had never used a Samsung phone.  I previously owned an iPhone 4 and was simply tired of Apple trying to disguise lack of innovation with their typical marketing gimmicks.  Here's what I thought about the GS3: The screen is bigger, it already can operate on 4G networks, the operating system was just as fast (if not faster) as iOS and the camera took great quality pictures.  The Android system sticks with Google Maps, which Apple decided to abandon this time around, and you see where that got them.  And here's the kicker: The international unlocked version of this phone was nearly $200 dollars cheaper than the iPhone 5.So far I have only discovered one shortcoming.  When using S-voice the phone's data plan needs to be enabled or you must be connected to wifi.  I'm not sure why this is necessary as some of the voice commanded functionality does not require Google.  For example, 'Send message to Steve: Why doesn't S-voice work when I'm not connected to the internet?' This message would elicit the automated voice (from the drone woman living inside the phone) saying 'Network unavailable.'  Again, this is the only disappointment thus far.Overall I do not even slightly regret my purchase decision.                    Hi,After waiting for a long time, i bought samsung galaxy s3 when the rate was below $600. I bought unlocked mobile without checking the model. (thinking that there is only one model). My intend was to buy QuadCore processor but ended up buying dual core processor. When i enquired it, i learned that there are many models in S3 and i bought SGH-T999 which is dual core and locked mobile. Mostly, mobile manufactured in China, seems to be not working correctly. Looks like this product is not genuine if it is manufactured in China. Hence i returned back the mobile.My suggestion is to buy this mobile after checking twice or thrice with the seller. There are lot of models of S3 out there in market. Buy the correct one.                    after 1 month use it constantly restarts in french instead of English like i set it up it should. I don't know why...hey, at least it shutdowns and powers up in English and at least its still functions as the description said it wouldits a real phone which is good, i can update, i had updated to 4.1.2 but recently 4.3 came out and I don't want to update because it was reported the 4.3 OS decreases battery life for the s3. So this shows that this product is update-able which is good.This was my first purchase in Amazon, I am looking forward into doing Business with this seller (shopebest) again.                    I love this phone for its size and features. I have to charge it every night, usually will last me a whole day and be just about empty by night. My biggest problem with this phone is the reception is terrible. My neighbor has the same phone and his gets excellent reception, I think some of them are just lemons when it comes to the reception part.                    I bought this phone but the battery is too large. Does fit the phone. Later I discovered it is from Korea.                    -after 4 months the usb port stop working and the phone is not under warranty by Samsung and is really hard to get it fix                    My wife is asking for a Samsung Galaxy III or IV, however, from reading these reviews it appears we would be making the same mistake that we made when we bought their HDTVs--zero support when the item dies due to poor-quality internals.My wife's 40-inch Samsung HDTV in our bedroom died just after the 1-year warranty expired, and neither Samsung nor the vendor would help.When our 52-inch Samsung HDTV in our living room also died about 3 years after we had purchased it, the repairman asked over the phone,"Does it make a clicking sound when you try to turn it on, but no picture appears?""Yes, how did you know""Samsung is infamous for using cheap but poor-quality capacitors. We get calls for this type of repair every day. You're lucky you got 3 years out of it. Most die just after the one-year warranty expires, like your wife's did.""How much to come to our home to replace the capacitors in the 52-incher?""$350, including the 4 capacitors that need replacement."                    Truth is, phone works well, but it came with a preloaded video, disgusting and degenerate, not even porn, worse, unhuman things, some people may find it funny, i don't know, but i bought a new unused phone and instead, i received a loaded phone, with disgusting videos, and i wonder everyday what would had happened if the phone was a gift for my daughter and she saw that disgusting video of nude people doing disgasting things i should not explain on this review. And i am not speaking about pornography, or sexuality, its a unhumain video.                    I have enough with this phone! It keeps rebooting every single day! I just had for 1 week! The phone keeps rebooting, restarting, and remaining in the starting screen. I got sick of this phone! I really want to return it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                    This is a very fast cellphone, works perfectly and has an amazing camera. totally recomended!!!! Great HD Screen. BUY IT!
!###This smart phone up to my expectations exceeded.It is light, handy, nice, with countless applications and resources.I would have to write an article to express the many facets and the multiple facets of this extraordinary smart phone and I have no time for it                    It's sluggish. maybe cos I have 5K contacts. but damn sluggish. the brightness is too much most of the time.otherwise great.                    The phone is OK I guess. I bought it as a gift and was delivered abroad to Colombia, was broken and samsung refuses to fix it or replace it hence the 2 stars rating. Be careful.                    EL EQUIPO LLEGO EN PERFECTAS CONDICIONES TOTALMENTE NUEVO, LO UNICO MALO QUE EL VENDEDOR NO ENVIO LA FACTURA COMERCIAL Y LA EMPRESA QUE LO TRASLADA A VENEZUELA LE HACE FALTA, SUGIERO SIEMPRE ENVIAR FACTURA COMERCIAL (AUNQUE SEA UNA COPIA)                    I have to pay $80 to unlock the phone. Tengo que pagar $80 adicionales para liberar el telefono. &iquest;Quien me los reembolsa luego?                    Probably not a bad phone, but due to radio frequency issues with T-Mobile in Southern California, data is limited to 2G "Edge" data rates which is unusably slow for this sort of device.So Beware!                    I was on the verge of buying the new iphone but just couldn't stomach the price for the unlocked version. add the fact that Apple keeps changing its adapters (and the fact that it has become a me-too phone) and my attention started to stray. a colleague had just bought a new Xperia using Android 4.2 and i was amazed. Ultimately i decided on the S3 and I am in love with it. The speed, versatility, app selection, screen, storage, extra features, Samsung software - everything is amazing. I do like it better than my colleague's Xperia - the S3 usability is a bit better. I can't believe people are still buying iphones. Apple started the smartphone craze so they were the first, granted. They have great marketing but just a good product. Samsung S3 has good marketing but a great phone. Runs circles around the new iphone.                    The Samsung Galaxy S III is by all means the best phone on the market. I will say however, there are some things that could use some improvement. Overall, awesome phone and would encourage all to buy it. Here are a few things I like, and a few that I don't:Battery Life (4 Stars) Just need to learn how to adjust your settings to maximize.When I received my shiny new phone three months ago after signing up with Sprint, I was a little disappointed with the battery life right off the bat. When I get a new phone, I spend way too many hours learning the new device, trying out all its cool new features and downloading countless apps. It didn't take long before I realized I was doing something wrong when my battery wouldn't last me through the day. The S3 advertised better battery life and talk time than any other smartphone on the market. This was one of the main reasons I bought the thing, so it was very frustrating to have it dying on me so quickly. Luckily, the S3 has a handy feature that allows you to easily look at what apps are draining your battery life. I found that my charge was draining before my very eyes because I had my personal and work email accounts syncing way too frequently. Now I set it up so that refreshes at specific times, which change depending on time of day and day of the week.Android Version (4 Stars) Outdated, but so is every other phone on the market.In my opinion one of the biggest fall backs of them all is that the machine is still running Ice Cream Sandwich (v. 4.0.2). If the S3 really is the phone of the future, why isn't every phone company jumping at the chance to get Jelly Bean (v. 4.1/4.2) on this device. It is important to note that there is a very small percentage of Android users currently using Jelly Bean, so it is not old news just yet.Text Identification (3 Stars) Inaccurate and causes errors, latest update helped some.The text identification features are not what I would expect from a phone like this. My 1st generation touch screen phone did this better than the S3. Things like capitalizing the letter "I" when it stands alone seem obvious, but the automatic changes do not take place on this phone. Other examples include auto punctuation of conjunctions and capitalization of proper nouns. The auto correct is shotty and does not catch much of anything worth while. The latest update has helped some, but still much room for improvement here. It would be nice if they had an easy way to put in punctuation without switching back and forth between alphabet and numerical text entry screens all the time.Talk-to-Text (4 Stars) Awesome feature but struggles at first, betters with age.The talk-to-text feature is incredibly helpful for texting on the go. You can use this feature anywhere you would type text. It is a little difficult at first, and it may not always pick up your words, but it will get better with time and practice. The machine just needs to learn your speech patterns and it will get better at learning how you talk as time goes on.S Voice (5 Stars) Galaxy could kick Siri's butt any day of the week.Just hit the home button twice, and up pops S Voice, Google's retort to the Siri function on iphones. Her name is Galaxy and she is just as good as Siri, if not better. Ask her to do anything from setting an alarm for you to citing the capital of Michigan. Just visit one of the helpful forums that give a lot of tips and tricks.Motions & Gestures (5 Stars) Cool new ways to easily complete tasksMake sure you check out all the cool motions and gestures that you can do to easily navigate and complete tasks. They found an innovative way to make shortcuts with ever dwindling buttons. The tutorials when you first get your phone do an excellent job of introducing you to these nice shortcuts.                    Very light and great performance.  Good look and high quality videos & photos, free apps, and much more...The only weakness: Battery life                    If you're buying this phone, you have to have in mind several things:1. It is a big phone. I myself find the screen size very useful, but if you have small hands or don't have a fancy for big phones, this isn't for you.2. Operating system is fast; if you have previously owned an iphone you will find it quite easy to shift toward an android platform.3. Headphones have a good sound to them as long as you are standing still. If you're a jogger, you will find that the cable transmit EVERY little tapping sound right back to your inner ear. Solution? yes, run the cable underneath your clothes.4. On screen keyboard is not always accurate.5. Excellent camera: takes beautiful pictures and comes with several different shutter modes, including a panorama software.6. Many of the apps are free on the google play store.7. Battery charger, unfortunately, is european standard. You'll need an adapter.Overall, it's a pretty good phone. And once you get used to the size of it (which takes only a couple of days) every other phone will seem toy-like.
!###This is an awesome Cell phone. It was delivered on time. The box was sealed properly. I hope i can buy the samsung galaxy S iv very soon...                    Excellent phone, great performance and quality of the materials. I haven't got any problem with it and it's been 6 months that i have it.

Brazil - Gramado - Rio Grande do SulWas this vendor, I never got the phone as well never answered e-mails, Do not trust the vendor
!###At first, I thought this phone was great.  However, with every update, it becomes more and more useless.  Free apps disappear, only to be replaced with ones that will cost you money every month if you wish to use them properly.  Oh, sure, they offer "free but limited" use (which means you can't use it as you'd like.  For THAT privilege, you have to pay.)  Do yourself a favor and find something that isn't a Samsung.  I have 18 months before I can dump this piece of junk.                    the phone is a Chinese version similar to S3, not like the truth and sell it at the price of the original. not specify the type of phone, I need to return                    too slow! Not what u would expect from Samsung! My 3rd Galaxy, loved the others, but this one is defective and my money is wasted! Bummer                    My GT-I9300 displays an error when opening the camera &#34;unknown error occured&#34;.No entry in the internet solution to solve the problem.                    I thought this was going to be a protection to the body of my phone. Nope. I ended up buying Asmyna SAMSIIICASKCA602 Premium Slim and Durable Protective Cover for Samsung Galaxy S3.It looks nice and it covers my screen... but that's all.... and not a good value for the price.                    I was using this phone around 10 months after that the phone started to freezing.. can somebody tell how to claim the warranty.?                    Excelent!...this Company was very professional and the product was in excelent conditions...we received it on time and everything was OK...                    EL producto llego al timepo estimado, sin ningu problema, nuevo y con los sellos de nuevo, que garantiza lo original del producto                    This is a very good Phone with lots of features and is the top notch in terms of technology and usefool tools.
!###This phone was supposed to be factory unlocked, but is not, i have tried with 3 different simcard and still getting the NO SIM message.                    First off i only gave it one start because you are not allowed to give it a 0 rating.  Which is exactly what is deserves.  I hate Apple with a passion for it's canned, forced nearly communistic package.  But i should have never have switched from the iPhone to this junk.  One grace of the S3 is its screen.  Big, crisp, good resolution.  That is where the positive ends.  Texting - By default you have to turn off 3 'built in' apps just to get it to act like a normal phone.  And even after that you still cant stop the 'slide'  on most phones if you hit a button that is what the phone takes as the input.  On the Galaxy S3 it doesnt take the input until your finger leaves the surface.  You can slide all day long and it wont choose a character till you let go.  Secondly if you turn the phone horizontally, you cant see any of the previous messages.  So if you are replying you wont be able to see what was said before.  Calls - Yes it is the 7th used function of a cell phone yet it is probably one of the S3's worst functions.  Call clarity is sub-standard, currently my S3 wont answer until someone calls me twice.  the first time goes right to voicemail.  when i call out half the time it rings once and then disconnects.  Verizon Wireless says it has to be some software as the network is operating properly.  If you want to use the keypad after a call connects you have it on speaker or use a headset or the phone goes blank (dark) after one key.DO NOT BUY THE GALAXY S3.                    Gets hot, battery life is dismal, poor Bluetooth stereo signal (about 5 feet) and poor Wi-Fi signal. Specs are sweet but performance is seriously lacking. Trust me the IPhone 5 will crush this. Touch screen is not very accurate or responsive when using Internet. My battery is almost drained while typing this. Have you ever heard of Gorilla Glass? Well this phone has Shatters Glass instead. Drop it once from any height and it shatters!!!!                    The 2 handsets available at present are the: International and N.A. models. The SK model(s) will be tomorrow. I bought the marble white N.A. model and it's crap. Let me tell you why:* You HAVE to buy this from a carrier on a contract favoured to the carrier without 100% insurance. If your credit is not on par then you will have trouble.* IF you buy this somehow from a reseller without a contract, read the fine print regarding their return policy.* The N.A. version is dumbed down, period. This phone is for dummies if not on contract. Why? It is over-valued as price and risk of loss are higher than over-all value.* If you drop this thing and it breaks, GAME OVER. You will have lost your money and then have to spend more to replace it.THIS THING IS PLASTIC and GLASS. THE PRICE IS HYPED AND OVER-VALUED!!! I cannot stress this enough.Now, if we lived in a World where You and/or I could buy this phone anywhere, anytime for any provider AND easily purchase rock-solid insurance at a very reasonable price, then I'd agree that this is a keeper. BUT IT ISN'T. Sure go buy an Otterbox brick-sized case for more money just to protect it. Not from water though, nor from loss/damage or being stolen.If this thing was backed by Samsung with these sort of common-sense, simple, cradle to grave considerations, or at least a map to where this exists, then they could be very consumer-friendly, BUT they're not so don't be a dummy and get sucked into the hype before you truly THINK about how your earnings are help putting who out of business.I support Android, but these handset makers easily detach themselves from product responsibility when crazed cellphone consumers see tunnel-vision.Look for a company that insures any cellular phone with rock-solid fine print and commitment to consumer justice. If one does not exist, there you go, it's an entrepreneurial cash-cow waiting for your inception. :)
!###All I have to say is if you buy this phone, BUY A CASE.  This thing is as fragile of a phone as I've ever seen.  Mine fell on the carpet, TV remote landed on it and the screen cracked all over the phone.  This happened less than 12 hours after I bought it.I owned an HTC EVO before this and that thing was a brick.  This Galaxy S III is more like a thin cracker.  I did love the phone for the 2 hours I actually got to use it.  Just beware and BUY A CASE.                    this is an excellent product, the best cellular than i've ever hadthis is another world. bye BB100% recommend                    Basically this is my first smart phone, so for me this phone is like out of this world.I just enjoy the android apps on this and also the web surfing experience is truly amazing.                    Love this phone! I switched from a Droid 2 Global with slider keyboard to this phone because I have been using my phone for tv-viewing on HULU plus, Netflix, and other apps like those daily. I wanted a bigger screen size and better quality resolution of the video image. I was not disappointed. The camera is fantastic too! The photos come out great and anything I view looks clear and bright. One let down was that they kept advertizing that you can minimize your video and txt, email, browse, while continuing to watch. Don't be fooled: it is only videos you watch in their native viewer and does not work with Hulu and Netflix, etc. Oh well. Small sacrificed on my expectations for a great phone. Oh, and the Google Play Music Cloud is AMAZING! I uploaded my 3,000 songs to the cloud and can now listen to them anytime from anywhere without taking up storage space on my phone.Seller was also very responsive, helpful, and quick!                    I did not buy this phoine for me. I got it for a Cousin. Anyways, he's very satisfied with the phone. It has great reviews all around the web as one of the best cell phones in the market. It looks great too. The screen is quite large and the resolution is very good. The processor is very fast and the connectivity is great. I especially like the fact that you can expand the memory, unlike the iPhone in which you can't. This is a very nice product. Highly recommended.                    Delivery was lightning quick. The phone is beautiful, feels great In my hand and fun to use.Bought this phone to use with Straight Talk so far no problems.I have the Samsung Galaxy Tablet 10 so was already familiar with the icons etc.I know this phone does so much more than  I have been able to figure out.I hate predictive words takes me longer to write because I have to go back and delete. Uggh                    This is the BEST cellphone i have ever owned. The internet is super fast, takes beautiful pictures, and is super light ! The only downside is that the battery life is not so great... but i can manage.                    Excelente compra, es garantizada, posee todas las funciones que un smart phone debe tener. Fue una buena decisi&oacute;n. Lo recomiendo.                    Great Phone!!!! Best Galaxy ever, best phone in the market! I was between this and the I5, I decided for the S3 because of the Screen and the SO. I love my phone                    I have the T-Mobile version and got it the week it was released. I've been using it for a few months now and I'm still totally in love with it. I love how fast it is and the pebble blue look. Customization is great on it and the tricks (like screenshot by swiping the side of your palm on the screen and moving icons to different pages by tilting the phone) are awesome. I've even gotten that free Cee-Lo Green song download from one of those NFC phone booth billboards lol Haven't really beamed much as sending pics in texts is just a habit now and having my friend and myself turn the beam feature on and off in order to share something is kind of annoying. Have successfully converted 3 of my iPhone-loving friends into getting the S3. :) Still discovering new things about the phone, hope we get Jelly Bean soon!
!###-Definitely this Samsung Galaxy S III/S3 GT-I9300 Factory Unlocked Phone - International Version (Pebble Blue) is way better than iPhone, with a perfect price !My daughter loves it and took it to Brazil, where is working perfectly FINE, after we cut the SIM card with the tool we bought on Amazon.com ;The Samsung Galaxy phone is beautiful, full of options and applications and the seller was wonderful - congratz !                    I was concern about if this handset was a real factory unlock or not, but after test with two. diferent carrier .it work perfectly. it seems is a "corean version" of the phone, but not problem with it. intructions in several languagues and the phone defaul is english so.. it was perfect. the international version work on most of the bands for other american countries... my phone got one automatic firmware update but still is working perfectly...THe only GSIII issue is the weak logic control between Wi-Fi and 3G/HSDPA... it doesn't switch smooth as the iphone 4. i hope this issue samsung fix it on next software release.regarding the seller everything was ok.                    Met and has exceeded my expectations; especially being a previous owner of a blackberry. Application space is significant! Easy to use. Takes beautiful pictures. Though it is a bigger phone than the blackberry, it is light and still hold in a pocket. You will need a microsim.                    I had the iPhone 4, which I unfortunately lost. I thought I'd hold out getting a new one due to the rumors that an iPhone 5 would be coming out. When the time came, I found myself so unsure of whether to go for the new version or try something new, like the S3.  I have to say that I love this phone! It does so many great things, the screen is beautiful.. I'm obsessed with the maps and navigation feature. It blows my GPS out of the water!                    amazing screen on this beauty. im keeping an eye on the battery though, i think its draining too fast. so far so good though                    This is probably the best phone out there. iPhone 5 is nowhere near the GS3. Been using it for a month now and i'm still exhilarated by it's display. Worth every penny..                    I have been really confused between iPhone and Galaxy S3 and did lot of research before making final decision. I am very happy with my Galaxy S3 it is just amazing phone. My biggest worry before purchase was its size but actually I am very comfortable with its size, size is just right for me.                    This mobile is amazing. It is factory unlocked and it's the international version due to having so many languages installed. I received the French packaged version, and everything was in French, which is amazing as well. Works with my vodafone UK, has great screen size, and is fast. The package itself says it all on what type of mobile you can expect out of the box. Overall it's a phenomenal device. So far so good.                    Hi guys. I am currently 14 days into using this phone and I have to say that I am loving it. I purchased the SIM card from Straight Talk and had the phone dialing and receiving the day I got the card in the mail. This means I am on a gs3 with a 41$/mo Unlimited Everything plan. In case you're worried, you will not see problems with overages because this phone does wireless so well you will almost never use data mbs. Love this phone, and it can be had for a reasonable amount, with no contract. Even if you can't get into this phone for the full 600 and have to go with a carrier for a cheaper phone, do it. This is the phone that will get you through the next 3 years without costing that much more and with everything you need to be cool and informed. 3 years at this price is a steal.Things I don't love:camera should be 12 MPs to really make this phone shinethe manual should have something about how you shouldn't put a screen protector on a gs3 and whyOverpriced, Samsung should be offering this phone with 64 gbs not 16 for this price                    Amazing cellphone, but I didn't know that this t-mobile phone only have 2 cores (1,5 ghz :/ ) If I knew that I would bought another model with 4 cores (1,4 ghz).. at least, this phone has 2 gb of RAM
!###I buy a GSM phone unlocked and sent me one CDMA. I can not use it in my country. and yet I had no response for the solution of the problem. I will continue waiting before the respective legal procedures. I would not recommend you buy from this store. due to their failure in their operations.                    sometimes is hard to connect internet by wi-fi and sometimes impossible. Battery turn-off saving, mostly, help me with this problem in United States. I hope this does not happens when I come back to Brazil!!!                    I TRIED TO ACTIVATE THE PHONE BUT I CAN'T CAUSE IT IS REGISTERED WITH ANOTHER PHONE LINE AND IT IS NOT NEW, IT IS USED. I WANT TO CHANGE THIS PHONE                    I went from a G2 to the galaxy S3. First off this phone has so many annoyances it's sickening. Firstly, it gets ridiculously hot. I have had to send it in twice because the temperature was reading 120 degrees (F) when I wasn't even using it. The phone runs so slow I almost want to throw it at a wall. The keyboard takes on average 15 seconds to come up and load, EVERY time, WITH power saving apps turned off. Battery life is abysmal, I use power saving mode and juice defender together. And you know whats even more convenient, when you have a low battery and you cannot even open the camera app, it's really great. The capture button on the camera app is so inconvienently located that it's impossible to get a clear, non blurry picture. Avoid this phone at all costs.                    i love the phone but was not verizon comparable. i wasted a lot of my time trying to conect and dint work. there was not enough information all fine prints. it sucks.                    this phone is encoded with European frequency which is different than U.S. frequency used to receive internet signal. Therefore, where you can get 4G or 4G LTE with T Mobile  service (for example) using a U.S. phone, you will only be able to get 2G or 3G on this phone due to the frequency coding being different. For the additional $60 for the phone plus $40 of sales tax for $100 total more, it was worth it to me to get the U.S. version of the phone from T Mobile instead.                    This piece of hardware is awesome. I choose this on basis on price difference with its successor S4.S4 has slightly more horse power which is not very vital for my use and the difference between the two , saves me about 200 dollars.  So far I havent had any issues with this phone.                    I am not really a cell phone person and prefer to communicate with people face to face.  Well the phone has the ability for me to achieve this.  Is is lightweight and easy to use.  Glad I made the purchase.                    i was user for another brands and samsung exceeded my expectations by far. the best phone that i have had. highly recommended
!###I have been a huge fan of Android phones for some time now and I recently upgraded from a Samsung Nexus S to a Galaxy S3.I absolutely love the S3. It is almost the perfect phone. I just worry about the screen breaking as I have heard it is quite fragile.I purchased a screen protector that fits very well and makes the glass scratch proof.Great job Samsung                    The phone, with the European version, arrived as planned. Sadly, during the use, it fell and the supposedly indestructible gorilla glass screen cracked completely. Also, it's very slippery to grab on the hand.Bottom line, I recommend to stick to SGS2                    Ordered the phone on Friday and it arrived on Monday.  I had to wait until Wednesday for the mini to micro SIM cutter to arrive before I was able to use the phone on T-mobile network.  I have purchased Apple phones since iPhone 3G was introduced but changed to Samsung Android phone last year.  I have purchased both Palm products and various Windows mobile variants prior to Apple OS.  I have purchased at least one, sometimes 2 phones every year since the early 90's both in USA and Japan.  I have purchased 8 smart phones since 2006.  This is the first time purchasing a mobile phone from Amazon.Pros:I agree with most of the posted positive reviews so I will not repeat the great features of this phone.Cons:1.  Data speed on T-mobile network is EDGE, same speed as iPhone 2G (2.5G technology; 200 kbps download and 100 kbps upload).  If I use Samsung phones sold in USA by T-mobile I can get >8 mbps download and >1 mbps upload at same locations.2.  Gorilla Glass 2 easily cracks.  I have multiple cracks across the entire screen after dropping the phone from approximately 3 feet, less than a week old.  Touch screen and LCD is working fine but I must deal with very visible cracks.  Unfortunately the glass is fused to the display, and the display to the Galaxy S III's frame.  I must purchase the entire display module including the glass, LCD, backlight, touch screen and the metal frame.  The cost of this module is $300 plus shipping.  I have dropped my previous phones many times (iPhones and smaller size Samsung phone) and never damaged the screen in the past.  I may consider paying $7-$11 per month for insurance even with a $200 deductible for my next phone.  I will most likely purchase a new phone from Amazon with a contract (Less than $150) and use my international unlocked phone with many cracks when I travel outside USA.3.  Japanese language support still requires loading an application.  Apple OS supported Japanese and other languages since its introduction.  Single button in all applications to change language.  I noticed Korean language is supported with Samsung keyboard.                    justamente lo que esperaba, el articulo llego tal cual lo describ&iacute;an en la publicaci&oacute;n, lo recomiendo 100%, es una empresa responsable                    There is a known HW problem with this phone. It can result in Sudden Death. The phone will die and not restart. Mine worked for 6 months......Because this is an international version, Samsung USA will not support you and point you to Samsung UK. They in turn will also not support you because the phone is not an EU phone. So you are left in limbo. I have been trying to get a straight answer from Samsung for weeks, no one knows where to service the phone. Samsung's support model is abominable. No one takes ownership or responds.So be forewarned in buying Samsung products, support is BAD                    No matter what you read, or what anyone tells you, the screen on this phone is absolutely terrible.I mean its a total lie. It scratches, cracks, and shatters extremely easily. They advertise this as gorilla glass, but no way.Get a case from the get go, and you will be fine, but you shouldnt have to worry about a phone like that.The actual phone besides the screen is ok, nothing insanely great but it works fine. Some bloatware and such, but still a nice device when its working.                    This is probably the worst phone I have ever owned. It's a combination of the unintuitive android and the horrible battery. It's really not worth it unless you don't need to use the phone after 5pm. That's when it will die on you. Even though you've only used it for a few phone calls and a few text messages. Very poor power management. The os is not very smart, basic options are hidden underneath multiple levels of menus. And good luck doing anything fast on it.. Bottom line its a piece of crap. I hate to say it but stick with iOS or windows. It'll make your life easier.                    Hello,I purchased a supposedly unlocked samsung galaxy 3 and now have found out that it can NOT be used due to the new AT&T & T-Mobile rules. Please email me to resolve this issue.                    My apologies this review is going to be a little scattered because it's 7AM and I haven't been to bed yet ;)So I pre-ordered the iPhone 5 about a week before it was due to be released and like most of you I saw all the Samsung adverts: the next big thing is already here, blah, blah, blah and I started to waffle a bit: was I being an Apple fanboy/girl?  I mean I've always wanted a bigger screen and I'm a chick so keeping something in my pocket doesn't matter to me - so when the e-mail came from BB that my pre-ordered iPhone 5 would not be arriving I decided this is God's way of telling me to get the Galaxy S3 :)Drove to BB on "iPhone 5" day and picked up my brand spankin' new S3 and then straight to the mall to get ripped off of $40 by Zagg because I just can't get those darned shields/skins to go on right myself.Turned on the phone and was floored by the big pretty screen although I have to say I must really be spoiled by the Retina screen because while everyone talks about the great screen the only thing great about it is it's big.Battery life was initially terrible until I downloaded this battery juice app and while it improved it I still have to charge the phone everyday (unlike the iPhone 4)Now while I'm a long time Mac user (I'd estimate since about '98) I always thought the whole Apple love fest was a little over wrought UNTIL I would try to go back to Windows (last time I made that mistake was over 8 years ago) and then I'd remember that I just really appreciate the whole Apple aesthetic.The same goes for the whole "Apple just more intuitive" meme - but I guess I've finally learned that (for me at least) it's true and darn it the apps are just "prettier".  You can actually Google why are Android apps so ugly and get lots of hits.Little quirks that are specific to me but may also matter to you:I prefer the way the home screen on the iPhone alerts you to missed calls.I like my push notifications.For some reason my Optimum app (cable company) finds both of my DVRs but the Android version only finds one and the iPhone version lets me watch TV on my Phone and the Android version does not.The only thing I prefer about the Android is the widgets.Bottom line is I paid $199 for this phone with no sales tax in New Hampshire - now I am home in NY and I am going to pay $218 for the iPhone 5 and flush the $40 I paid to Zagg down the toilet and pay another $40 to get my iPhone 5 wrapped - so I'm essentially going to shell out and/or lose almost 100 bucks because that is how much I just cannot stomach this phone in comparison to the iPhone.Now I wrote this review because a lot of the reviews I read about people who switched from the iPhone to the Galaxy were overwhelming positive and really gave me the final push and I wanted to add a disenting voice to balance those reviews out.  I'm not going to get into an argument with Android fan boys who are getting just as bad as Apple ones.                    My husband wanted a small cell work and practice so that you buy and qye mimi is practical and important for me is that my husband and I feel good buy
!###Purchased because my iPhone screen turned all psychedelic on me with multi-changing colors and nothing else for two days straight. Not very useful What's a guy to do when the iPhone 5 is not here and EVERY ONE else appears to have an iPhone? Do Droid, go droid in a big way and never look back. This latest version of Galaxy is great for many many reasons but most of all b/c it is not an iphone :)I still have all my apps from iphone, enjoy blazing fast 4G speeds and love the fact that this phone is totally customizable (widgets, tiles, etc.) Two days after activating the GS3, my iphone came back to life- too late buddy :)  side by side, the iphone is just too heavy, and too small.                    Excellent product, all I wanted, is the best phone that I ever bought. I had the galaxy II and this is a very huge advance. Is a good recomendation for any one that loves google, android, and samsumg.                    Samsung Galaxy S3 is an awesome phone and has really nice video quality .Camera is superb the only problem i faced that it uses micro SIM card instead of the normal SIM card we generally use but thats easily resolvable..                    After 4 months, this phone decided to stop working. I called Samsung.com and they said they don't cover the warranty for international phone, so I later contacted the seller, Worldwide Distributors. They told me to contact Samsung.uk, even though I live in the U.S., but Samsung.uk refused to repair my phone since I live in U.S. They only offer assistance to people living in one of the EU countries. In other words, this product didn't have any warranty, and now Amazon cannot do anything to force the seller to offer me any kind of support. I spent countless hours trying to get my phone fixed, but I made the huge mistake to spend a lot of money on a defective phone without any type of warranty coverage. Wolrdwide Distributors is a a fraud and their team is very rude. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE FROM THEM OR ANY EXPENSIVE ELECTRONIC.                    Great disappointment ... Buy the Samsung Galaxy S3 GT-I9300 Quad Core again and they sent me a different model the Galaxy S III / SGH I747 Dual Core no box no accessories and no manuals. Do not recommend.Gran decepcion... Compre el Samsung Galaxy S3 GT-I9300 Quad Core nuevo y me enviaron otro modelo diferente el Galaxy S III /SGH I747 Dual Core sin caja sin accesorios y sin manuales. No recomiendo al vendedor                    Ok so I received this phone this morning and I expected to get a phone exactly like the one I have...NOPE! I guess the international version has a lot less features than the american version. Front camera is horrible and the OLED screen it claims is not OLED. Its obviously LED. it doesnt even have NFC as it claims. I really feel like I should have only paid 200 bucks for this fake thing. It doesnt even have swype or S-voice. I actually think its rooted because the Kernal version says ubuntu...SERIOUSLY? I was expected to latest Andriod version but instead I got Gingerbread! WTF?!! The only reason I am keeping this is because im tired of looking for phone but I advise you not to buy this phone from this seller.                    Original Review: August 8, 2013I didn't even buy the phone, I'm just looking into it for my girlfriend.If you read the specs of this phone, it's clearly not the GT-I9300. The GT-I9300 has a Quad Core 1.4 GHz processor. The specs on this page says it has a dual core 1.5 GHz. This is probably the Galaxy SIII I747 or the Galaxy S3 T999 that comes with a 1.5GHz dual core snapdragon processor.Know your stuff people!Update: August 15, 2013So she decided to try her luck and purchased it. I don't know what's going on with this seller and the specs he posted on this page, as well as the many bad reviews that this product has been getting. Way too many people complaining about phone being Chinese version, or not being the i9300 galaxy siii...or even saying the product is used, or the cables won't work etc....but she is having none of those issues.I inspected the phone thoroughly when she got it, made sure everything was okay. Turns out she actually received the international one, with the quad core processor and everything. Seemed brand spanking new, all seals were unbroken and it came with all the accessories needed for use. The phone came packed with Jelly Bean 4.1.2 and everything that it should have. The phone also has no branding on it(no T-Mobile sticker or anything).The only thing that alarmed me a little was that the phone, when turned on for the first time, came up in French. It was a simple work around though, I just changed the language in the language and input settings. All the pamphlets and manuals were primarily in French as well, which is inconvenient for some people as they read that stuff...not us though so all is well.I uploaded a couple pictures, just check the customer uploaded images.                    First of all I would like to say Nothing wrong with this item as a phone and I am giving it five star, also nothing wrong with amazon, the only issue is with an amazon seller which is (abe-123), I contacted that seller around the past three weeks without any respond although amazon is confirming every sent e-mail just few minutes after sending. I purchased this phone for $680.00 on July 2012 here at amazon and I understand that there is no warranty for this international version, but it I understand that it is covered by factory warranty. This phone stopped working and died on January 2013 after just five months without any mishandling or misuse, Samsung USA turned me to Samsung UK where international versions can be repaired, The guy in UK gave me The number that I shoul write on the package in order to be accepted by the repair center, but Samsung UK refused to accept this phone for repair and they returned the phone back to me after paying another $100.00 for shipping by FEDEX. I came back to amazon trying to find a resolution to my issue, but amazon is terning me to that seller who is not responding at all, now I ended-up with a dead phone that costs me $680.00 for the phone + $100.00 paid to FEDEX. All what I was looking for is at least to hear from amazon if they can help in this case or not but I was not expect to take that silent situation. So I found my responsibility to give new customer my experience with purchasing an international versions, just be aware you may be in my shoes one day.                    Given the track record of the Samsung Galaxy S series, it is no wonder the latest edition to the line has been the talk of the Android town. With a recent international release and a US launch right around the corner, we took some time to get acquainted with the Samsung Galaxy S III and put it through its paces.The US version of the phone, which for the first time is identical on all major carriers including Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile, differs slightly from its international counterpart in the hardware department, featuring a dual-core Snapdragon S4 processor as opposed to a quad-core Exynos chipset, but despite the CPU swap, the phone benefits from 2GB of RAM and LTE/HSPA+ 42 (depending on carrier) connectivity.HARDWARE:If you are looking for top-notch hardware, look no further than the Samsung Galaxy S III. Its spec sheet puts it on par with recent heavy weights like the HTC One X and easily place it amongst the most powerful devices on the market. The phone's hardware is built up around two cornerstones: a 1.5GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 processor and a gorgeous 4.8-inch Super AMOLED HD display. Throw in 2GB of RAM and you are dealing with just about the smoothest Android 4.0 experience on the market.DESIGN:The Galaxy S III keeps things relatively simple. An 8.6mm profile appears all the thinner thanks to some well-place curves while a metallic bezel breaks up any sharp lines (the Pebble Blue color scheme seems apply named as the phone gives off the appearance that it has been gently shaped by nature, much like a rock at the bottom of a riverbed). You won't find many ports, only a microUSB connection for charging. With available adaptors it can also act as an HD video output. A power on/off/standby button and volume rocker are the only two physical keys aside from the standard Galaxy S III home button.Yes, the Galaxy S III home button is back, which means Samsung has opted to not go with Android Ice Cream Sandwich's software navigation keys.  The physical home button is flanked by two capacitive buttons, one that will call up the "Menu" functions and the other operating as the "Back" key. These keys are backlit and light up only when touched (the time-out can be adjusted or set to always on). We'll get to how Samsung has handled Android 4.0&#8242;s multi-tasking function in the `Software' section.An 8MP camera handles picture and video, which can be recorded in full 1080p HD. The rear sensor is equipped with a flash and auto-focus capabilities and supplemented by a front-facing camera for vanity shots and video calls.As benchmarks will attest to, the average person won't notice much of a difference between the quad-core and dual-core versions of the GS3. In fact, owners of the dual-core version get a few added bonuses in the form of an additional gig of RAM and the ability to utilize the latest 4G networks. Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T's versions of the phone are equipped with LTE while T-Mobile operates on HSPA+ 42, meaning data speeds will be top-notch no matter what network the phone is activated on. Quality may be influenced by the particular carrier, but the phone's hardware provides solid, clear audio during calls.SOFTWARESamsung has not only gone to great lengths to offer one of the most impressive pieces of Android hardware we have ever seen, but also to add a level or richness to the Android operating system itself. Based around Ice Cream Sandwich, a new generation of Samsung's TouchWiz interface has been enhanced with human interaction in mind. Not only are we introduced to new gestures such as the ability to place the phone to your ear while viewing a text message to initiate a call or to pan between homescreens by moving the phone left or right, but Samsung has also made using the smartphone a more social experience with some new sharing features.NFC is utilized to both network devices for sharing photos and video, but also to take advantage of new Samsung's new TecTiles, which we have covered previously. Group sharing allows one user to stream a presentation, video, or photo to multiple handsets, while AllShare lets users send content to a television set or share files between a PC and their phone. Sharing even extends into the phone's camera.If that's not enough, Samsung has also included the new S Voice application, which allows users to command their phone using only their voice. The service offers plenty of functionality and is right up there with Apple's popular Siri in terms of usefulness. S Voice can call up a weather report, perform a Google search, get direction, or compose a text message with ease.Add in a customizable launcher bar, lockscreen shortcuts, and toggle switches in the notifications pane to control WiFi, Bluetooth, Airplane Mode and more, and Samsung has just about covered anything. Well, except for multi-tasking, which, for whatever reason, is now accessed by long-pressing the physical home key. We can understand why Samsung might want to strive for consistency and keep the phone's trademark home button, but why they decided to forego Android 4.0&#8242;s new set of navigation buttons (back, home, and multi-tasking), has me scratching my head. Multi-tasking still functions as it should, but as one of the central features of Ice Cream Sandwich it is a bit surprise that Samsung has placed it on the back burner, so to say.CAMERA:You want great pictures and even better features from your smartphone camera? Again, the Galaxy S III has you covered. The 8MP camera provides excellent photo and video, while an new capabilities make taking and sharing the results even easier than ever.While I was impressed with the results, things like Share Shot and Buddy Photo Share seal the deal. With Share Shot a group of Galaxy S III handsets can be linked over a wireless network to automatically share photos between devices as they are taken. Buddy Photo Share uses facial recognition to tag people from your contacts list in your photos automatically, allowing you to easily share pictures with your friends in them.Video mode has a few cool new features, including the ability to seamlessly snap photos while taking video (something we first same in HTC Sense 4.0) and a focus lock mode that keeps the camera trained to a certain focal point no matter where you move it, bringing professional level control over the final result.CONCLUSION:Consider me impressed. Even with a bit of apprehension about previous incarnations of the TouchWiz interface, Samsung still managed to deliver an intuitive and natural Android experience on top of hardware that really has no comparison (other than perhaps the HTC One X).                    I got the S3 for business calls, separate from my old S2 (personal use) which I've had for the past year without any problems and singing its (the S2) praises in the interim.  The S3 is 'touchy', meaning, I had to handle it far more delicately than the reliable S2.  Often the main screen would lock up requiring a re-boot which got to be annoying.  I failed to see much difference in speed in various movements either.  The equally annoying pop-up advisories on the S3 telling of what I could do with tilting the phone and other procedures was not something I was wanting so they kept coming in spite of my telling them ENOUGH!Making a long boring story more palatable, I returned the S3 within a couple of days and have decided to get another S2 for business calls.ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS:  I do want to be fair.  In thinking about it, the S3 has some features I failed to explore like the view-video while checking emails & other activities.  That may be important to many users but not me.  Also, the transferring of data by keying in the S feature to transfer data while simply backing the phone to another S3 unit.  Again, I don't know anyone else having an S3 so that was not used either.  I wonder how many others have that issue?  Maybe many, maybe few?Also, the S3 eliminated two electronic movement keys:  The S3 replaces the electronic up arrow to go to the home screen with a button to push.  All well and good but I found the button on the S3 unreliable on the first push, reguiring two or three pushes to get back and then finding multiple screens to deal with about half the time to sort out and get the outcome desired.  I like the electronic S2 up arrow which works every time.  Also, NO search electronic (microscope glass icon) on the S3, unlike on the S2.  No big deal except you have to sacrifice a space on your home screen for the S3.I think the S3 has many advantages over the S2 in terms of its internal software ICS or JB over GB but as a user?  I will readily admit to not being skilled enough to know the difference or able to test the added expertise to the point of seeing a meaningful difference.  So, if that's you, then go with the S2 and be happy.  If it's not?  Leave the old folk in the weeds and go boldy forward with the new technolgy and enjoy.  I'm out.
!###At the time of this review this is the best Android smartphone. That's what I expected when ordered and when I got it, I was not disappointed. Those familiar with Android will find all usual features, in a fast responding hardware, a beautiful large screen and a very thin and slick profile. Also some nice Samsung widgets and apps that come with it make initial configuration quick. The phone came unlocked and I was able to use my SIM card without any additional steps, besides the fact that it had to be converted into a microSIM using my knife :)Only one surprise when I got it - the phone came pre-configured for the German market, including language settings and some local bloatware. Eventually it was not a problem, I just switched the language and removed the bloatware (most of it was removable).A few points worth mentioning:Speed - I have had quite a few Android devices, phones and tablets - this is the fastest and smoothest one by far.Camera - I was very surprised with the speed of the camera and the quality of the pics.S-Voice (Siri equivalent) - pretty much worthless at this point...Contacts - I liked the additional options in the Samsung version, such as merging various user profiles (Facebook, Google, Skype etc) into one contact.Sound - Seems that the sound quality and max volume in the headphones are better than other devices I have/had.It has a Barometer, it's nice to have, still trying to find uses for it.                    Before I ordered the SGS3 I owned a SGS2 what is really great.But the SGS3 seems to beat the band. It is much better as expected. More comfortable, bigger and clearer screenand...just smarter. It's too much of paean to tribute to this phone, I would burst this place here.You can't make anything wrong buying this phone. But the price...will come down with time.And watch for your warranty! I have got NO certificate for a guaranty! (I hope, I never need)                    I have been using a droid Incredible for two years now, and despite some quirks, it's a great phone.  It's 3G, and I'm due for an upgrade on Verizon, so I thought maybe it's time for an iPhone.  Disappointed with the iPhone 5 features (and hype), I decided to go with the Galaxy S3 4G LTE on Verizon.  I LOVED it....for about 3 days.  I now hate it and am bringing it back for either a 4G incredible or the iPhone after all. Maybe I got a lemon, but I'm not going to try another one because my final criticism cannot be overcome (size).  So here's the issues in the FIRST WEEK:Heat:  The phone gets absurdly hot and at the same time drains the battery in minutes.  I'll pull it out of my back pocket, and despite being locked, there is some app running that wasn't running when I locked it, the phone is really hot, and the battery is low/dead.Mail:  Gmail pushes sometimes, doesn't others.  Might be a setting, but a frigging Google device should have seamless gmail.  And yes, of course I made sure I was on the network, etc.  I'm good with droidsVolume keys:  The keys are far too sensitive, seems like every time I barely tap them, the phone is on mute and I miss calls.Phone DIES:  On the 4th day I had it... *poof*...phone died.  Had to pull the battery and do a re-set.  Yes, this happened with my Incredible a few times, but maybe twice in two years..not on the FOURTH DAY.Screen Freezes:  Screen has frozen up on me about 15 times in this first week, if I'm on a webpage, the links do nothing; or in an application the buttons do nothing...then 5 minutes later it works again.Brightness adjustment has a mind of its own: Even when I set brightness to manual and turn it all the way up, the phone will decide to go dim on me so I can hardly see it.  If this is because the +/- buttons are being inadvertently pushed, I don't care...it's happening.RADIO:  This phone does NOT have an internal FM radio.  I researched it, and the European versions do.  I'm NOT talking about iHeart or another streaming product, those use data.  I'm talking about a regular built-in radio. My Incredible has one.  The headphones work as an antenna.  It works even if the phone isn't connected to a wireless network.  This phone doesn't, and that's lame.TOO BIG: The one problem I can't get past is the size.  I'm a pretty big guy, so I figured I'd get used to the size.  After a week....I haven't.  I pick up my old Incredible and miss it.  Yes, the screen on the Galaxy is amazing, but it barely fits in my front pocket.  Also, I like to run with my phone so I can listen to the radio (that this phone doesn't have...had to use iHeart), but this one is so big I can't ever get it to feel right and I KNOW I'm going to drop it too often.  This one is a deal killer.  Think REALLY hard before getting one of these "phablets"; to me the trade off isn't worth it.Bottom line:  The Galaxy screen is amazing.  The phone is wicked fast, and I love all the widgets I'm used to. Web surfing is amazing (when it's not frozen), and I'm sure the camera is great (I've only taken a few pictures), but for me,  this phone has WAY too many quirks. If I'm looking at my screen thinking "now what?" half the time...then I have no use for the thing.I am within my 14 days and am going to bring this phone back.And before you Galaxy 3 nuts flame me and tell me everything I did wrong, please understand:  I am an experienced droid user who REALLY, REALLY wanted to love this phone. And if you need to go through a list of "fixes" that could make all these issues go away, then the phone obviously has major design flaws.If I could get past the size, I'd probably try another one (there's no way these are common problems, is there?), but it's too darned big so I'm moving on.Now the problem is what to get.  The iPhone 5 supposedly has horrible maps and that stupid new charger or I'd probably just give up and go that route, but I'm thinking trying another droid....maybe the Razr or another Incredible.                    When I first got the Galaxy S3, I really liked it.  At the same time, my wife got the Motorola Droid Razr Maxx.  Within a few days (setting up both phones), I noticed the Motorola was on the 4G network and the signal showed 3 bars.  But the Galaxy S3 showed "searching for service" or had 1 bar.  It also rarely shows that it is on a 3G or 4G network.The other issue I noticed is that the volume key (left side) and the Power/Reset/Lock key (right side) very sensitive to a light touch.  Thus holding the device, it was easy to accidentally press the volume keys in such a way as to turn off the sound, or accidentally touching the power key (turning the device on and off).  Putting the device in a leather pouch on my belt, I found the device could turn on and off (or change volume) just from my movements.Despite all the great things about this phone, these two issues are enough to make me return the phone and select something else.                    Give it three stars cause of delivery was on time and packaging was ok, could of been a smaller box doh. But beware cause the Samsung Galaxy S III/S3 GT-I9300 Factory Unlocked Phone - International Version is not unlock. To use any other sim in is totally not possible cause it is region lock to the UK. A note from Samsung Germany that the Note 3 along side some other Samsung phones is region locked only until activation. Once activated in the European market on a European carrier the lock is removed and users can use the phones without any restrictions but nopes that ain&#8217;t the truth peeps. The region lock has appeared on newer versions of Samsung Galaxy S4 and S4 mini also so I just want you guys to be aware with this factory unlock stupidness with Samsung phones. The phone would only ask for Sim Network Unlock Pin, note that this is the region lock and not your actual sim card pin, if enter too many wrong numbers you are looking for more trouble with the phone. I give it three stars also cause I had to pay $50US for it to get unlock which was nearly impossible to unlock, after unlocking the phone the phone works great. It Is a really cool phone to have. Oh and am not from the US am from the Caribbean in Trinidad.                    It's my first android and so far its working perfect, i was a little nervous because i'm in Venezuela but it's working just fine!                    The Galaxy SIII was my first ever smartphone, and I acquired it last year, 2012, in August. I was moderately upset at first that my carrier did not offer the iPhone, but I quickly began to overlook that as this little (but really no so little) phone began to amaze me.It can do essentially everything an iPhone can do and more! The operating system is user friendly, intuitive, easy to navigate. There were so many different things you could do with it, open app market and all. I had no difficulty learning how to use it to its fullest potential. Even my boyfriend, who had an iPhone 4S became jealous and seriously considered switching to android when his phone kaputs. My only qualm was that the screen was a touch too over-saturated - and the greens were much too harsh. Still, not too bad, and samsung screens are typically very excellent. The glass protecting the phone was excellent, Gorilla Glass. Very sturdy, and even after a complete year, only light surface scratches were visible.Fast forward to March 2013, and everything began to slow down on my S3. It still functioned, but it was no where near as zippy as before. Come April, it constantly crashed, it couldn't manage basic functions, such as texting and calling.I became very frustrated and questioned some employees at my carrier about it. I was informed that a lot of the S3 devices were slowing down, and apparently that's normal for Android phones. After doing some research, this isn't some anomaly either. S3s out of the box were just as slow. Conveniently the employees reminded me that the S4 was coming out and was faster than ever. Yes, of course, it comes out a month after my phone essentially became unusable.Considering that after all expenses were met, I paid over $600.00 for this device, and it only has a life of less than a year, I don't feel it's worth the investment. Yes, the operating system, app store, and overall customizability of the phone is excellent, and I would wager that it surpasses what Apple has to offer, however, does it really compensate for a device that lasts only one year?Sadly, you can't have it all. Come August my phone completely broke down, and I had to purchase another one. Despite the pressure from the employees to purchase the Galaxy S4, I went with the iPhone 5. Less friendly operating system, app store, and impossible to customize, but I feel that trade off might actually be worth it, if the device lasts over a year. My boyfriend's iPhone 4S is reaching two years old, and functioning essentially as it always has right out of the box, hopefully the 5 will do the same.                    I have had no problems with this smartphone after 3 weeks of use, It works really well, met my expectations in terms of battery life camera functionality, size, fit etc. The phone was delivered as was promised  . However is was advertised as having 16 GB of  built in storage but  the product came with only 11 GB and  this was very disappointing .                    After one month, my phone keep on restarting for every 5 mins. i took it to repair shop they told motherboard needs to be replaced. which costs almost half of the phone cost.. I just took a chance even by looking the reviews.. i am screwed                    After a 7 year commitment to Apple, my sister talked me into trying the Samsung Galaxy S3. I bought the phone and have been HOOKED! The possibilities are endless!! I feel so unlimited with this phone. I'm not tied down by most apps and the android app store is amazing. I was a little worried I would be less-than-impressed with GooglePlay but its just as great as iTunes. And did I mention the screen is bigger? This is so helpful!
!###I bought this phone a few day ago, and was thrilled when it arrived. so crisp and clean. I took it to the local verizon store only to find out it is not compatible. Super upset about it, i only give it three stars for not being compatible with verizon.                    Am satisfied from the product and the shipment. However, the exchange rate used by Amazon was far higher then the official exchange rate.Amazon has charged me E. R. of 3.87 Shekels per 1 USD while the official E.R. was 3.62, which means almost 7%(!)higher!Why??I hv purchased : Smasung Galaxy S3 and Battery for Dell LapTop + some accessoroes.Thanks,  David Emunah.                    I purchased my phone online through my wireless carrier. The phone arrived 2 days later. The first thing I notice was how thin and fragile feeling it was, which immediately set up a red flag in my mind. As a result, I paid close attention to how I handled the phone and made plans to get a cover the very next day. I activated the phone and fell in love with it instantly. The next day, I pulled the phone out of my pocket as I walked into the wireless store to buy a cover and found the screen had broken while in my pocket. I had not bumped into anything, I had nothing else in my pocket. Additionally, the pants were not tight, so the phone moved around easily in said pocket. My wireless provider would not work with me on getting the screen fixed (told me my only option was to use my insurance) and at the prodding of some friends, I contacted Samsung directly. They told me a cracked screen voids the warranty so any repairs would be chargable. This burns me for two reason: 1. my carrier has a 15 day love or return it policy, which I now cannot use if I discover this phone doesn't meet my needs b/c the screen is cracked. 2. If any other functionality fails during the original warranty period, I have no rights b/c the screen broke and the warranty is now void. I would LOVE to be writing a glowing review of this phone, but instead I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth regarding this so-called "warranty". I will likely steer as far away from Samsung as possible in the future. I had an LG that fell from a 6 foot high railing onto a concrete patio and the only thing that happened was the battery falling out. This fragile hunk of plastic broke in my pocket. I think I'll stick with LG next time... in the meantime, I get to spend the next 18 months with a phone that makes me angry every time I look at it. It's going to be a long 18 months.                    The camera quality is breathtaking. Too bad I can't share them with my friends.It's impossible to upload pictures to Facebook. Uploads fail 90% of the time, especially if I try tagging friends, adding a location, or posting to an album instead of to my own wall.I even tried using Bluetooth to transfer photos to my laptop so that I can upload them from my computer, but Bluetooth doesn't work at all. I can't even transfer photos through Bluetooth to other users.I have to plug my phone into my laptop with a USB cable if I want any chance of sharing photos.The texting application is embarrassingly undeveloped. Until recently, I couldn't even receive group texts from non-Android users. I could send out a text to multiple people at once, but the responses would come back in separate texts. When I try sending more than one photo in a message, the texting app compresses it into a slideshow that non-Android users cannot open. Likewise, when non-Android users send me more than one photo in a message, I have to open the slideshow but cannot zoom in while it is playing. I have to download each individual frame and THEN open it.I was looking forward to the Galaxy S3, since my tech savvy friends were touting its customizability as a benefit that trumps the iPhone's convenience, but I should have gone for convenience.                    I bought a Samsung galaxy S3 I9300 unlocked, but what I got, after they had to resend the package using fedex because apparently usps "lost it" on its way, was a galaxy S3 SGH-i747 on an I9300's box, without manuals nor headphones, just the phone, which came with the home button loose and kind of as if it's always pressed, and (at least) the charger.                    Based on the battery life along, this phone is not worth buying. I installed a program to monitor the battery life. Even with this activated, the battery can die in less than 10 hours. My iPhone 4 never had this problem. Watching videos is great on this product, however, with low battery life, this doesn't equate to much. If the phone had a decent battery life, I would still give it about 3.5 stars purely based on it's constant freezing and shutting down applications.                    We need the PIN code to unlock the phone that was purchased as unlocked.The Sansung GIII number FCC ID : A3LGTI9300ARATSSN I9300GSMH; IMEI 354244/05/377139/6 S/N:RF1CA4TP36K. After I give this mobile as a gift, I discovered that my dauther couldn't use it in Brazil by it is blocked. Please forward the procedure to use it in Brazil                    Unfortunately anyone considering this device should Google-search the term "Issue 36993:  wifi no longer working in ics 4.0.4 " or simply "galaxy wifi authentication failed".  Essentially at this time you may find yourself without any option to connect to the internet. In other words, a pretty useless paper weight.The various forums have several threads on the topic where users, including IT professionals, who own android devices are reporting the problem and not finding a solution or work around. Typical posts from the above read:* "just signed a 2 year contract. Had I known about this issue I never would have committed my two years to this device. Now Im stuck."* "I am too extremely frustrated that for $700 i have a piece of plastic doing a half job... simply unaccceptable.  Google needs to push some kind of update ASAP and start treating the android project seriously..."* "Huge problem!!!! Bought 2 galaxy 3's and a galaxy tab 10.1 2 all with no ability to connect WiFi!! This is unacceptable!!!"A bug in Android, introduced in v4.0.4 and persisiting through the latest Android v4.1.2, prevents android devices from connecting to many, mainstream, wifi routers. If your home/office router is one of those, tough luck.  Users have these routers working fine with all non-android devices (ie iOS, Windows...). Also, many Galaxy devices (including mine) worked fine up to the v4.0.4 upgrade.Personally I had been an advocate of the Samsung Google product family.  When first activating my S3 I thought apple does not currently offer any phone that can match it. However the lack of networking functionality, and lack of communication by these companies in the several months of this issue persisting should be unacceptable and potential consumers here should be aware and beware.                    It's all they say about this cell.Ithink it's too much tecnology for us in Brasil.Great buy. I recomend it for all Amazon buyers                    You people have no lives...and probably work for Apple. Seriously one stars for the S3? Right. It is way worse than any phone you have ever owned....and it is just aweful. This phone is awesome....flat out. Please, do us all a favor and go buy an iphone. Congrats!
!###This was my first smartphone other than my trusty Blackberry.  After much research, I settled on the S3, as it was advertised as already superior to the upcoming (at the time) iPhone 5.Now I am not a techie, and I have not installed any software or gimmicks that would mess with the programming.  My apps are pretty basic, including pdf reader, document reader etc.The problems:1. the phone restarts automatically without a warning.  My wife has the same problem, yes I was so impressed with the advertising that I had got her one at the same time.2. the phone takes time to respond.  If I want to make a phone call, I press the "Contacts" or the "Phone" icon, and then wait up to 5 seconds for the phone to respond.  Irritating.3. the phone goes to sleep and doesn't respond.  Just now, the screen went dark (it was fully charged so that so battery was not an issue), and the phone refused to wake up.  So out of curiosity I dialed my own number on my office land-line.  The call went through, and my land-line indicated that the S3 was ringing, but it wasn't ringing in my hand, the screen remained dark.  Then I took the battery out and restarted the S3.  This is not the first time that the screen went dark and I had to restart the phone to get it to work again.The battery life sucks, but that is entirely another matter.  This device just doesn't function as a phone.I know most people are happy with it, but I don't like it, and my wife is disgusted with it, as are a few of my friends.Now I am thinking of moving to the iPhone, I hear it is much more reliable, even though it is more expensive.                    I loved this phone, but about seven months after I started using this phone without problems I suddenly stopped having access to internet or internet based apps, I could only work with wi-fi. I contacted my provider, we tried troubleshooting, different configurations, etc, nothing worked. I went to the store, the SIM card was changed, it still did not work. Since it was unlocked I had to contact the manufacturer. Because it is an international version, Samsung US said they could not fix or repair. I emailed Samsung UK and they said that because I was located outside the EU I should look for a local repair center. I finally went back to Amazon and they had the best customer care service and I returned to the seller for a refund. I am still buying my new phone from Amazon because of their fabulous customer service.                    Is there any guruntte ? what should I do? it just happaned suddenely without any thing happaning. Very frustrating. Only 9 monthes                    I dont know what is wrong but the phone keep on shutting down like after every 5 mins. This is my second s3 and this is the first one to give me problem. Im not pleased at all. feeled ripped off                    I bought this Samsung Galaxy S3 as a new phone. I initially got a phone that didn't work properly, phones were always dropping as well as I could not navigate through the internet because it lost signal. After the phone was changed to a &#34;NEW ONE&#34;, I got a used phone, the screen was popping out, the USB port didn't work properly and the battery was not even Samsung original. It was obvious the phone was used even though it came sealed inside the box. The worst experience I've had with an Amazon supplier                    I actually enjoyed my galaxy s3 immensely.But after eight months it simply died without warning. Look it up: it's the galaxy sudden death syndrome.This is especially common in this specific model with 16GB.NO ONE IS TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS.Not surge telecom. Not Samsung. Not Amazon.Money down the drain.I'm never buying Samsung again.                    promptly responsded to inquiries before and AFTER SALES and GUARANTEED the product also.... Before and after the sale.The phone is great. I had iPhone from the first to the 4S and always had issues. The latest was an APPLE UPDATE which made the iPhone useless.... the Samsung so far if GREAT... can't say that I will ever go back to Apple now that I've tried ANDROID/ SAMSUNG. had other androids before this one, none were good.... Till the Galaxy SIII.Definitely buy!                    I'm using it for almost 8 months and just don't see any issues or troubles with the phone. The functionality is just what I need, screen resolution is enough for email reading and Internet browsing. Battery is strong enough to hold energy for a day of extensive use and charging with standard charger is fast enough. Gorilla Glass works as advertised - no scratches after usage in pretty severe conditions.The phone was also used during very cold season (average temp during winter minus 15 degrees, sometimes 20-25 below zero) - saw no glitches and battery also hold it's power.                    Great phone. In fact it is more than a phone it is lik a mini tablet computer. Switching between apps can be slow sometimes but understandable. The speed of processing though, isbawesome. This is definitely not a "single hamd control" phone, so driving and using is particularly hazardous....so dont tect and drive with the SIII.                    Really nice this device. I am just waiting for the android 4.2.2 notify by samsung. Very nice camera and screen quality
!###I was wondering if you can use this phone for T-Mobile prepaid company , because it doesnt say that on the title so i would like to know                    Producto lleg&oacute; s tiempo y en buenas condiciones y si lo pudee ocupar en mi pa&iacute;s lo que quiere decir que si esta desbloqueado para utilizarlo con cualquier opersdoforavde telefon&iacute;a en cualquier pa&iacute;s                    excelente equipo l&aacute;stima que en mi pa&iacute;s aun no funciona 4g (VENEZUELA), es tan potente como dicen, muy superior s la competencia iPhone 5                    I absolutely LOVE the Samsung Galaxy S3. I have had it for about a month and a half now and it is a great phone.The Camera is phenomenal. It takes pictures quickly and the quality of the photos is amazing. I had the HTC EVO before and that also had an 8 megapixel camera, but the s3 camera is just so much better. the evo camera hesitated, but this one focuses so quickly and takes the picture the second you press the button. Also, there is a burst shot option so you can take action shots. I think its a great feature. I have used it once (i haven't really had many action shot opportunities), but i did enjoy having it as an option and i thought it worked really well.Some people complain about the phone's size, but it doesn't bother me at all. Compared to the HTC EVO, the screen itself is bigger, but the phone is only a tiny bit taller, and about the same width. the s3 is also significantly lighter than the evo and easier to hold because of the rounded sides. The design is really chic and modern. I love the look of it.The graphics on the s3 are also gorgeous. The screen is so clear and the graphics are really defined which really enhances the experience of using the phone.I like the battery life as well. It lasts more than a full day, however you probably couldn't go two full days without charging it. The evo had terrible battery life. I would leave my phone in my backpack at school all day and barely even check it and i would get home with 20%-30% battery. With the s3, i do the same and come home with 90% battery. The battery actually lasts surprisingly well when i play games and am constantly checking twitter or texts, while on the evo, playing one game for a short time practically drained the battery.Overall, the Galaxy S3 is a great phone. It is easy to use and figure out and has some great features. I really like the widgets it comes with, and if you pull down the bar on the top, you can see your messages, emails, updates, etc, but you also have the major settings there. You can easily access the wi-fi, bluetooth, gps, sound, screen rotation, airplane mode, and even power saving mode. I love this feature because with the evo i had to go into settings and find the right category to turn certain things on and off. I especially love being able to access screen rotation so easily because i generally leave it off, but i like it on if i'm looking through pictures. I definitely recommend this phone for anyone looking for a new smartphone. I hope this was helpful, and good luck choosing your phone!                    Can someone who bought it tell me which processor comes with this phone right here?.. i just want to clear the confusion. I need the Quad-core version!"                    This is a great device.  Nice with powerful applications..  Bye bye I-phone.....................Welcome Galaxy S III.....  Android  is the Best                    This is not a review but a question for those who have the phone: How do you back it up, so you don't lose data if something goes wrong? I am looking to replace my ancient Treo 650 smartphone; it syncs with a program (Palm Desktop) on my computer. Recently the phone crashed and I had to do a complete reset, which destroyed all data and settings on the phone. I synced with the PC and everything was restored. Can you do that with the Galaxy S3? If so, how? One more question: Is this phone not-branded; i.e., no carrier logo?                    Muy Buen telefono, lo recomiendo. Ligero y potente. Mejor que el iphone 5. Tengo el blanco y el azul y son muy elegantes.                    I am appealing to all persons buying phones on Amazon from Worldwide Distibutors be careful.  They are selling phones made in Hungary with all instructions not in English.My experience after purchasing phone from Amazon (Worldwide Distributors) after 2 months the phone was no longer working, it just went off, after testing battery which was good, I realized I was sold a faulty phone.I wrote Amazon and Worldwide Distributors on three occassions and all Amazon did is to keep referring me to Worldwide Distributors.  Worldwide Distributors keep referring me Samsung.  Samsung couldn't help since they cannot understand how the phone count out so quickly.I am stocked with a phone costing me $534.00 US after just 2 months with no help from both Amazon and Worldwide DIstributors.  To this day Amazon never tried to help me or even apologise to me for selling me a &#34;Lemon&#34;.  I will not even think of purchasing anything from Amazon again until this problem is solved.  I am seeking a new authentic Samsung Galaxy Phone to replace the faulty one I now have.  I have informed all the persons I know not to buy on Amazon, because they do not take care of customeres when they are sold faulty products  Please heed this call customers.                    It was the product purchased, they sent me a different model while a Galaxy S3 is not indicating the publication is an i9300. I received a Samsung SGH-i747 which has a dual core processor direfencia lower than the i9300 has a quad-core, has no radio, is a model of AT & T. Do not agree with what is received as it is not what you buy.
!###This phone is excellent, great product, here in Venezuela is awesome, my espectavives was super, very thankfull for the service and the product                    Having owned a vast number of cellphones myself from different brands and using different OS I'm forced to recommend this one, not only because it absolutely met my expectations but because it shows how a great product, with a great design and a fantastic software implementation can be put out there for a fair price.                    I took this to Vietnam, bought a sim card and work out of the box.  I love it.  I would recommend to buy it.                    Phone is great, but Int'l unlocked version did not work well on AT&T in the US.  Problems with texts not arriving on several occasions. Phone worked well for demos.                    So far, I love this phone. I upgraded from the Galaxy SII I9100 and am thankful that I did so. I love the larger screen and added features. Do not regret this purchase at all.                    The Samsung Glaxy S3 is very good. The quality is good and have tools for day by day. The support of samsung is good.                    excellent product nice screen now i know what they call s,art phones battery last long and speakers are loud enough great value                    Got this for the GF and she is addicted. Only issue I have with this phone is the battery life, but with the quality that it pushes out it's somewhat understandable. Just get an extra battery if needs be.                    Well this was was definitely a great buy. Works great, completely unlocked.  Mine was originally in French but I quickly changed it to English using the menu options. Was even able to rot it in under 3 minutes. The phone itself has rather short battery life but that's a Samsung issue.  It comes just as advertised in immaculate condition.  Great phone and I'm enjoying it immensely.                    I have been using Galaxy Note II for several months and recently used for a comparison at a friend's place with S3. Both are running similar software and except for the pen capabilities, S3 is identical from a user's point of view. I used the Nike+ app with external GPS on both phones, and the routing and mapping shown were excellent.GPS locks on Google Navigation was almost instantaneous and spot on. With a 4.8 inch HD Super AMOLED(1280x720) display screen is awesome. Pictures are awesome Rear: 8 Mega pixel Front: 1.9 Mega pixel. 64 MB microSD card makes storage abundant with all of the Google Drive/Music/Amazon mp3/box/dropbox and all of these.In essence, phone is super speed and is nice. With iphone's 3.5 or 4" is looking too small compared to awesome phones Samsung is releasing. I wish they continue the upward trend and lose focus on design/weight/features/updates.
!###Nov 1, 2012 Update on my phone. When it worked, it was great & I loved it. Now AT&T & myself can't get it to work, even with new SIM cards. Won't recognize AT&T data signals. So my $600.00 smart phone is now DUMB & I hate that it doesn't work! I can ONLY make & receive calls (maybe). AT&T is unable to get my phone to work properly, 4 calls to customer service & 2 times at AT&T store with no resolution. Samsung US will not help because it's international phone. I did not want an international phone, just an unlocked phone. So buyer beware, you may have problems with the unlocked international phone on AT&T or T-Mobile.Oct 4, 2012 I'm being asked to review the Galaxy S3 GT-19300 international version Pebble Blue (which is ultimately what I received in the mail). HOWEVER... What I PURCHASED from Amazon (looking at my printed order as I type this) was, "Samsung Galaxy S3 Unlocked GSM Smart Phone (Pebble Blue). Sold by TRD-Trading GmbH." There was NOTHING in the title or the product description/details to indicate this was an unlocked international phone. SURPRISE ON DELIVERY... The package arrived on 9/5/12 after the stated delivery date of 8/31/2012. When I opened the package from GLOBAL MOBILES, I found European charger, US adaptor, German & English language instructions booklets, German apps, German voice recognition, and some typed instructions on how to get phone to work on US cell service. Well I'm not a techno geek, so this was a little puzzling for me to figure out quickly & easily.I have purchased many items through Amazon and have always been satisfied. However, I was disappointed in the representation of this product. I would have wanted to know before my purchase that I was purchasing an international unlocked phone. Buyer beware, a little more truth in advertising.It took myself & the AT&T rep almost an hour to get the phone working correctly & remove German language issues for the voice recognition. I was finally able to remove the pre-installed German apps after several days of attempts (they kept coming back), I think they are finally gone.  The ONE big drawback so far (aside from the initial stuff) the battery life is not so great & I have it on battery saving mode. I have to recharge every day. My old Samsung Capitvate went for days before needing a charge. Is there a solution for this battery issue? Otherwise, this IS a great phone. I'll take Android any day. Another BIG plus, I'm not locked into a contract & don't have all the bloatware that cell providers think you need & want.So far, I'm happy with the phone & when I figure out all it can do, I'll love it. I also think the unlocked international version is probably the better version.  Also, I have been unable to find the user manual for the GT-19300. The Samsung site does not show one & Google searches have not come up with any. Has anyone found the user manual for the Galaxy S3 GT-19300?                    If you get good Sprint or AT&T reception, then ABSOLUTLEY get this phone on those carriers.Would you buy a Verizon iPhone if it were inferior to a Sprint/AT&T iPhone?The Verizon version of the Galaxy S3 is crippled compared to the Sprint and AT&T versions.  Verizon will not allow software developers to update the software on the phone.  Meanwhile Sprint and AT&T Galaxy S3 users who update are already enjoying the latest version of Android (Jelly Bean).  It took a year before Verizon updated the software on previous smart phones.While the phone might look as good as the Sprint and AT&T versions, the instant you turn it on you will know you're on last year's model for a current model's price.I got bamboozled when I sign my 2 year contract.  My 2 week old phone is already inferior to the other carriers.                    I've had the phone for a few days now, here's whats up.Pros:beautiful design and giant screenblazing fast 4G and processorcustomize everythingbattery life is incredible. lasts all day with heavy uselight weightCons:camera sometimes seems to have trouble focusingvolume rocker and power button on direct opposite sides (who thought this was a good idea??)s voice is useless, but jellybean update will take care of that                    This will be long but for those trying to decide whether or not to get this between the iPhone 5 then hopefully you'll find the information useful.  My wife and I bought the phones together with GSIII for me and iPhone 5 for her.Overall impression after six months of use there are many good things to say about the GSIII.Galaxy SIII Pro's:- Gorgeous large AMOLED screen- The thin & curved design feels very nice holding it- Very fast with dual core (USA version)- Crisp videos* and photos that rival good point & shoot cameras- Customization is endless- Removable battery & expandable memory up to 64GB- Google products work flawlessly syncing- Lots of free apps compared to AppleGalaxy SIII Con's:- Battery life- The large screen may not be easy to one hand type or operate for a small hand- Not as stable as iPhone sometimes- microUSB is great but not as good as the iPhone's design- Home button is really in an awkward locationiPhone 5 Pro's:- Beautiful screen- Slim and easy to operate with one hand- Solid O/S and functions smoothly- The new connector is great with its flip flop design & secure- Tons of appsiPhone 5 Con's:- Too small for big hands and easy to fat finger when typing- Customization is very much limited unless you jailbreak- Many free apps on Android is generally charged for Apple- It feels a bit plain and boring after awhile playing with GSIII- Apple's own map app we all know was a complete failureWho should get the GSIII or the iPhone 5?  Galaxy SIII I feel is the phone for someone who wants to multi-task, do more than Facebook, watch videos and of course ADD like me who want to spice up the phone.  iPhone on the other hand would be great for someone looking for hassle free phone that's compact, solid performer and overall doesn't disappoint when it comes to getting the job done.More details on Galaxy SIII is below!AMOLED screen at 4.8" is THE screen to watch movies; not with the iPhone that seems a bit outdated when it comes to screen size.  Sometimes bigger IS better for watching YouTube, Netflix and other movie apps.  No argument there that GSIII is a great entertainment phone.  I've been a photographer for over 15 years and I find myself pleased with taking quick photos with the phone that don't need editing or fancy results.  It gets the job done, crisp and the videos in 1080p is gorgeous.  Sure it's not 60fps and the max 30fps isn't ideal for fast moving videos but unless you're very picky, again, it gets the job done.microUSB vs Apple's new connector has no argument.  Apple wins here.  microUSB is somewhat universal now with their phone and is great but it's not as secure and great design compared to Apple's that have a flip flop design.  I still find myself double checking at night or in a hurry to see which side is up or down with microUSB chargers.I'm currently running Android 4.1.2 and is rooted.  4.1.2 did give me few more options and 'seems' like it's stable compared to the 4.1.1 where sometimes it would freeze once a week or so depending on the app.  Don't get me wrong here, iPhone 5 does have lockup issues as I've seen it with my wife's couple times.  But that's the thing, 'couple times' out of six plus months we've owned the phones.Where do I begin about customization.  I frequently change wallpapers, icons and themes using "Go Launcher EX".  There are others including "ADW Launcher" and few I cannot remember but these launchers transform your phone into something much better than what comes with the phone.  It's rather boring without using custom themes on your Android device.  I've always said right out of box, iPhone/iPod Touch always had nice app icons that the whole world eventually started to copy including the Android.  Android on the other hand isn't like a fortress that limit you from changing things like Apple does with their product.  And often times apps are free if not cheaper so you get more bang for your buck.Customizing keyboard is one of the greatest option if you text, FB post and write emails often.  Swype is great but so are the aftermarket keyboard apps that give you more options in what works best.  This is where of course Apple fails and I don't like the iPhone's small keyboard as I have large hands.  It's right between large & XL for glove size so trying to type with two hands is a bit claustrophobic.  Holding it by one hand is better with the iPhone 5 of course; sometimes I cannot hold it with one hand try to complete a task with typing on the GSIII due to its size.Apps have grown tremendously and of course with the dual core processor, I can run the latest edition for Need for Speed on full graphics just fine.  I didn't think one day a phone could handle something that was limited to PC's and consoles years ago.  It's a blast honestly.  There's just too many reasons why we're glued to our phones and these little computers don't help the addiction either.Now let's talk battery life.  I always have it on power saving mode which does help but also I can recommend using apps like JuiceDefender Ultimate and if you're more tech savvy then Tasker would automate things you thought wasn't possible without an app.  For my use I generally have the phone tethered with USB using Klink (best tethering app that use carrier's DNS, not free DNS with other apps) so the charging isn't a problem.  But if I play Need for Speed, watch movies or do heavy multi-tasking, I can easily drain 30% of battery life in less than an hour.  Sat idle with some phone calls, the phone will last all day long without any worries.  It doesn't eat up a lot of battery even if you're on the phone for an hour.  It's known to drain more battery while browsing the net and like mentioned above, watching movies and doing something that requires the processor to work harder.No problem with heat issues; it does get pretty warm playing games, recording videos for long periods (20+ minutes) and watching movies.  But as long as you're not in a hot climate and beating the crap out of the phone you shouldn't have any overheating issues.  I've yet to encounter an incident where the phone shutdown other than a charging warning when I had the heat turned on during winter in the car and it was making my phone warm near the vent.If you're a Google product user like myself Android is godsend.  I practically use the calendar everyday, Gmail sync'd including Google maps favorites and sometimes use the voice feature.  Galaxy S-Voice is okay but nothing spectacular so I won't do much review there.  The technology is somewhat still limited and I do find Google's own voice recognition does much better in identifying what you're saying.Speaking of failed maps attempted by Apple, Google Maps is very solid on GSIII and using it with navigation.  GPS is very quick in the car and of course you have the offline option so download areas you drive often on Wifi and if for any reason you lose connection or in areas that have spotty service it'll come in handy.  I also use Waze and is very smooth.  In fact I have the phone setup to use a dash cam to sometimes which I forgot to mention; with the Anti-Shake mode on video you can record a very smooth video without the vibration from the car.  It'll help when you're shooting a video outside and get that annoying shake even though you think you're holding it steady, the option helps out a ton.And buy a 32GB microSD flash card if not larger memory card if you shoot a lot of videos and photos.  20 minutes of 720p video will easily run you close to 2GB of data.  If you're parents like myself definitely get a bigger card and back up those data.  But it's a great tool to capture quick moments of your little ones on the fly without having to take out a camcorder or a giant DSLR with lenses and flash.I'm done yet!  Flash...oh my.  The light on this thing is POWERFUL.  It'll blind you if you kept staring at it.  I have the free flashlight app and can light up an area better than most expensive LED flashlights.  I've ran it for 15 minutes straight without an issue.Of course there are tons of aftermarket accessories, screen protectors, cases, etc.  The options are unlimited.  On my car, I use Mountek MT5000 mount which secures the phone on the CD slot which works perfect.If there's one major complaint then it would be the home button.  Not sure why it's located so low to the screen; if it was moved 1/8" up it would make a huge difference.  I feel like I need to curve my thumb quite a bit just to hit home.  Maybe some may not find this a big deal.  Battery life is always going to be an issue with slimmer phones but it's not a deal breaker for me personally.  Overall design is breathtaking coming from HTC and other older phones.  Samsung did a great job there.It's a very fun device compared to the iPhone 5.  It can do A LOT more than what the iPhone offers.  Again if customization, multi-tasking and hoping to do a lot more for your phone then the GSIII is for you.  But if you're a casual or FB/email/text/browser user and don't care for all the fancy bells & whistles then iPhone 5 might be the ticket.  Rambling on it's 6AM now on Saturday so if you have any questions feel free to comment!                    Awesome. Can't keep it out of my hands. They thought of everything with this phone. What will Samsung come up with next :-)                    I've had an iphone and a couple droids and this beats them all hands down.I'm on Verizons network and get 40meg down and 20up with great reception everywhere.It's blazing fast, no load time for anything.The battery will last me 2 days with moderate usage.The screen is crisp and the colors are great.It weighs practically nothing.Pictures are great, good color even in darker rooms and the flash is really bright.If I had to complain about something, the back is made out of plastic which seems cheap, but who really cares about the back of the phone.                    I would like to express my displeasure with the Galaxy S3 (International Version I-9300 - purchased in China). I have had the phone since June of 2012 and in terms of performance the phone has more than met my expectations with one major flaw - this is the most fragile screen I have ever seen on a phone!In November of 2012 while in Norway on business trip I dropped the S3 phone from my pants pocket onto the floor of a bus. The distance of the fall was about two feet (distance from the seat of the bus to the floor) and the phone at the time had a screen protector. Regardless, this short fall led to the screen shattering in numerous places. Fine... My fault right, I dropped the phone. I called Samsung Norway and was told to take the phone into a repair center and repair the screen at my expense... Done.The phone was quickly repaired (entire screen and digitizer assembly were replaced) and the phone functioned well for a few months albeit I was much more careful with the phone which had in addition garnered the protection of a sturdy case (this takes away from the glamour of having such a thin phone but hey it was worth it to not have to deal with another broken screen).In January of this year, despite my increased care, the phone again slipped out of my pocket, this time falling a distance of about three feet while exiting a vehicle to land on snow covered concrete. Despite the new coat of armor, again the fall resulted in the screen shattering in numerous places. (As an aside, when this screen shatters the phone becomes very unusable as it results jagged pieces of glass being exposed, definitely not finger friendly).Once again, and with slightly more frustration, I called Samsung although this time from the US. I'm sorry to say that they were extremely unhelpful. As I have the international version of the phone they could not recommend a service center, and instead continuously referred me to the international long distance phone numbers for Samsung China and Samsung Hong Kong as they do not make or service the international device (far be it from me to think that when I call Samsung they would service their own products or at least have the ability to transfer me to someone that could).Now I am left again with a phone with a broken screen contemplating paying hundreds more of my own money to have the screen repaired. I have been a loyal Samsung customer for years (this is my fourth Galaxy Phone and I recently purchased the Note II) and while I will be the first to admit I do not treat my phones like fine China, I have never before experienced a phone with such limited durability (the Note II in contrast has demonstrated phenomenal durability). Google Galaxy S3 broken screen and you will find hundreds of similar stories! This is terrible and is clearly a design flaw inherent in the phone.All in all, this is a great phone as long as you treat it like fine China and don't expect it to survive real world conditions (and if you break it don't count on Samsung helping you out, at least in my experience)... I'm sorry to say I cannot recommend this phone even though I love everything else about it.Thank you for reading my review and please comment if you've had similar experiences. Perhaps if enough of us get onboard Samsung will make amends.                    The phone is large and after using I honestly feel like the iphone is a toy.  I have been using Smartphones since 92 with the HP ipaq and its nice that someone has finally put a decent sized screen on a phone.A major flaw with the phone is it will not Auto-connect with paired Bluetooth devices.  If you use a hands free system in your vehicle and you pair your Bluetooth to it, the phone will not auto-connect.  You have to go into Bluetooth settings every-time and click on the device (again that is already paired) BEFORE it will connect to it.Samsung support only apologizes, and offered no solution.  (I will update if there is a resolution)                    This phone is not compatible with a T-mobile sim card.(no 4g, will only perform at EDGE speeds) The description on Amazon says the 4G is "region based" and since I live in New York, my "region" does pick up 4G. I dont think the average consumer knows the specs of the phone. Now I'm being charged $65.00 just to return the phone (10%) plus shipping!!!! Very disappointed.
!###It was a att phone. Hat the AT&T logo on the back cover. If I had known I would have gone to the ATT store...                    Switched over from an iPhone 4 and like the OS...Love Androd flexibility, customization, etc. just not on this phone.After 2 days I bought an extended battery which made a large phone - large and HEAVY.I put the original battery back in, dropped it, shattered the glass, and bought a Droid Razr Maxx HD off of Craigslist.That's my experience.  I hope it helps people.Good luck out there!                    Really a awesome phone. I'm in love with it. Lot of functions are there, although much of those are not used in daily basis.                    hello, to use this phone in Latin America must have sim card, they? x x x xx x x x x x x x  x xx x x  x x x x x x  x x x                    Lost by UPS waiting for another one sent by dealer. Retailer should atomatically send another one when one is lost by the carrier.                    I have had many many other smart phones but this is so smooth and awesome phone yet. I am not a iphone user and never will. I have downloaded over 34 apps from the google play store and for free. I have downloaded over 15 apps/games for my son to play on and for free.  Don't know why anyone would buy anything else. Also, I downloaded the AVG antivirus app and WOW, it updates and scans everyday. Only once my son did something and it was stuck but very easy, I went to task manager and click to cancel that app and it was fixed. That easy. THE BEST PHONE EVER. Thanks Samsung. Please keep up the good work.                    De la tecnolog&iacute;a moderna.Muy lindo, barato y llega a tiempo. buena empresa vendedora, sigan adelante, ofeciendo productos de calidad, a buen precio y cumpliendo con los tiempos                    I broke My Droid Razr Maxx - So I figured I would replace it with the Samsung Galaxy S3.Loved the phone, hated the battery life.What I loved about the phone: Best user interface, software, performance, cell reception, display, light weight, replaceable battery, flap cover back (option). I just really liked it and wanted to keep it.However, I couldn't keep it. What I didnt like: The battery was only lasting about 4 hours of regular use - where same use I was getting 15-20 from Droid Razr Maxx. Yes, I checked the apps, yes I installed managers, yest I checked syncing and GPS and wifi, etc. Configured with even less functionality than Razr Maxx.  And I hadnt even installed most apps yet (Soundhound, Cardscan, etc) .Alas, keeping it plugged in all day is not an option for me - so I returned it to Verizon for the Droid Razr Maxx HD. I like everything about that phone, but cell reception is one bar less than regular Droid Razr Maxx.                    The phone could almost make coffee in the morning. After updating firmware to lattest version its even better. Only issue is that the usb cord which is also used to charge the phone does not fit very well so when plugging to it sometimes losses connection. Had to put a book on top of it so it would keep the weight and does not release the usb. I might buy a docking cradle for this.
!###I find myself in unusual position praising iPhone :-)  I bought Galaxy SIII for my brother overseas, who replaced his iPhone 4 or 4S. There are many things he likes about Galaxy SIII; however, he seriously considers changing it to iPhone 5. I don&#8217;t know why, but it is a fact. My wife is quite happy with Galaxy SIII, but she never had iPhone.                    Came the next day and worked out of the box.  I use it in china and works well. comes with European charger                    Nothing bad to say about this phone, it has all the features that I want, I usually use the hot spot, so far it didn't give me any headaches. I really do not understand the one review people, this is the best phone in the market, in my opinion better than Iphone 5 too.                    The phone is awsome i love it...they delivered as per my expectations but it will be great if i received a cover and screen protector..i have to buy it ...

I am very satisfied with Samsung products and their quality.                    excellent and very good product recommended, 100% quality samsung best, for now is a cell that is in competition with other telephony
!###a lot of features and a lot of bugs, the wifi keep turning off and on, doing bunch of researches and coming up with no solution to fix this issue plus a lot of other issues.                    I bought this phone a few weeks ago. It came in perfect condition, everything works wonderfully and I jus love it! There are so many things you can do with I. I would definitely recommend  this phone to anyone.                    Battery life much lower than advertised.  ALso, I had ordered two of these, and one fell on the ground and the screen cracked - is this covered by warranty?                    is the best cellphone i have ever tried. Its really fast and it takes really good potos. i love it                    The Galaxy S3 is an unlocked phone,  the box, cell and manuals were neat and in very good conditions. I guess originally for the french and italian market.                    Nice phone with a lot of features that fit my needs for entertainment and for business. I just miss a MX Office application                    I must admit for the time i had this phone, it was the best. Better than the iPhone in many ways, sleek, light, and above all fast. The large screen is bright, and beautiful to look at. Android yet again offers their fans customization that just isn't seen in other mobile devices. For all of this, it should be rated a 5/5.But, sadly, after just over 4 months of use, my Galaxy S3 shut off for good. No warning, no error screen, nothing. After searching for a solution to the problem on google, perhaps a hard reset, i saw that several people were having the same problems with their phones, and in most cases the only thing they were able to do about it was return it and get a new one.I will not be getting a phone that seems to just inexplicably stop working after a certain amount of time. Sorry Samsung. For as good as this phone was, the risk just isn't worth the reward.                    This would be an excellent, international phone if the 3G 1700 frequency band and the microSD card slot were NOT missing.                    Hi,I've been using this phone more than 3 months, and it performs well.Unfortunately, I dropped it on the floor few days ago, and cannot make it work anymore. I don't know where I can fix it. I lived in south California. Do you know where is the official repair store here? I've tried very hard for finding any resources online, and still cannot find it.Thanks!                    I choose good, because Now I have a trouble with usb connect and charge of the battery, I think  I have to buy a new battery and  a new usb connector.
!###There has been a huge amount off buzz for this phone recently, and it is not for no reason.Samsung Galaxy S III is the first real competition for the Iphone. There are several reasons for this:1- Aesthetics: Galaxy S III has a sleek and sexy design that can match up to the standarts of Apple.2- Functionality: In many aspects, this phone is as good as - if not better - than the Iphone.3- Android: The operating system has recently caught up with IOS. An important thing to note is that the popularity of an operating system is directly linked to its success. The more popular an OS gets, the more applications are released - hence more usability and features. I believe Android has just caught up with Apple in this sense.                    Recib&iacute; mis tel&eacute;fonos con las especificaciones descritas en los art&iacute;culos del vendedor, en perfectas condiciones,se los recomiendo a todos 100%                    It takes great pictures and great videos.  Beautiful big screen.  Easy to download games.  It is easy to hold and use.  It was unlocked.  I used a U.S mini sim card while there and in Central America a movistar sim card and I have had no problems.  I cannot find any problems with this phone.  I highly recommend it.                    I spent some time looking. I have to have an unlocked phone and since the quad version was only available in the international version, i gave it a try. It has definitely met my expectations and more. Fast versatile and good looking. I had to get use to the size but that didn't take long. The only downside is the price. Overall, I am very satisfied.                    Hi, i bought this phone with no problem. I have used it for 3 months and then the phone's motherboard gone bad. I have contacted Samsung but they did not help me at all. Because of the phone being international version, that's what i think, they asked me to contact Taiwan. Can you believe it, i am buying the phone from US and they want me to contact taiwan when there is a problem. Samsung did not take any responsibility of his product even it was under warranty. So i contacted Amazon and they have somehow solved my problem. Thanks to Amazon. But be careful when buying international version phone.                    I have to start saying that I am an Android fan. Before using this model I had a Galaxy GioThis particular model was everything I expected, the performance the upgrades, everything is a lot better than previous versions.I was afraid about the size, the last model I had was 4.1&#34; so I though 4.8&#34; was too much. The first time I made a call did feel weird, but  with time I got used to it. It fits great in my pocket even using a protective case.the battery improvement is great. I use my phones a lot, so I had to charge my phone twice per day. But now, with the same use I charge my Galaxy SIII every day and a half.The instructions came in English and Hebrew, and the main language for the phone was Hebrew, but don't worry. The first time you start the phone you get to change the language in the first screen.                    This phone is fast and light.  The screen resolution is great.  With the ability to add 64 GB of added storage to the phone, on top of the 16 GB internal (making a total of 80 GB), you should never have a storage issue with this phone.  Pretty much anything on this phone can be customized which is the main advantage of this phone over the iPhone 5.  The phone takes great pictures (for a phone) and the video quality is pretty good too.  The battery life is ok.  I charge it every night and as long as I don't play games on it the entire day it will usually last until I go to bed at night.  If you are just using it for texts and calls and the occasional web search then the battery should last you all day.  However, if you are constantly web browsing or streaming videos or playing games then you will probably run out of battery before the end of the day.                    excelente producto, el telefono se comport&oacute; perfectamente en Venezuela, no he tenido ningun inconveniente. el sistema operativo es de los mejores, vino con todos sus accesorios                    Before I bought this superb smart phone I did a lot of research and comparison. Then I read the smart phone ratings in Consumers Report and it helped me to finally decide on this instead of an iphone. You will not be mistaken in choosing this very good phone. It is very highly recommended.                    I totally loved this phone, everything in the package was seal, the only thing that i didn't like is the batery life but it isn't a big deal. I'm using it now in Venezuela and it works pretty well with Movistar.
!###I got this phone 3 months ago as a gift for my sister! She has no complain whatsoever with it ,,,                    good morningThe product this one good and in perfect conditionsAdo that refer says goodbye of youJose Diaz                    a great article, I to worked very well, is a product that meets the needs for which it acquired, and does not disappoint me, complying with each and every one of my needs.                    el mejor equipo que he tenido, supero todas mis expectativas, los accesorios son lo mejor, lo &uacute;nico que cambiaria es el adaptador de corriente                    Me gusto el tiempo y forma de entrega, cumple con las expectativas de comprar en linea, se entrego en domicilio bien embalado.                    Just received the phone today, took it to Verizon to get the smaller SIM card and was informed that this phone is not compatible with the Verizon network.  Amazon customer service worked with on setting up returning the phone.Kind of bummed, but off to the big blue box to pick up the phone.                    buen producto el equipo es totalmente nuevo funciona a la perfeccion es exactamente lo que esperaba y el precio es razonable                    THIS IS THE BEST SMART PHONE I EVER BOUGH. THE TOUCH SCREEN WORK GRAT. IS VERY EASY TO SET AND THE CAMERA IS THE BEST IN A CELLULAR.                    I bought the samsung with Hasslefreecell - and I was first not amused because I had to puy customs taxes for France. I told them I now they gave me a part back. So I think that's a nice gesture, because it's something the French government does :(:(:(                    was I fell from a height of 10 centimeters and is broke the screen, I do not recommend for anything this phone is broken very easily, I have a HTC that is me has fallen many times, that if it is a truth phone!
!###I was a little skeptical that samsung's usability design might be a little sloppy compared to the 800 lb gorilla they are challenging (apple).  I was not disappointed.  The large screen with the thin profile needed a grippy case to keep it from being too thin, but once I did that it's really an excellent product.  The OLED HD screen is very easy on the eyes.  I would agree with other reviewers that it's the best phone I've owned.                    Very Good! Works Excellent no problems / Todo Excelente tra&iacute;do a Venezuela, Funciona perfectamente, liberado, la entrega se hizo a tiempo.                    Pros: Lot of nice Apps and large enough screen. Unit is very flat and compact.Cons: Battery life sucks. Charge cycle to 100% ranges from 3 hours to a woefully turtle slow of 6.5 hours from a 15% battery power remaining capacity. Screen not bright enough when using the automatic brightness feature.                    came smoothly everything ahead of schedule. I recommend it 100%. all without any problems . . . . . . !                    Power button is not good. I have to check with service center and need to repair. it does not meet my expectation.                    Bought it for my Dad and he is enjoying using it. Good phone with many useful features and apps. will recommend it.                    ME ENCANTO EL EQUIPO, ES SUPER INTERACTIVO, UTIL, PRACTICO Y FACIL DE MANEJAR. ME ENCANTA MI TELEFONO NUEVO Y EL COLOR MARAVILLOSO                    I ordered this Samsung Galaxy S III GT-19300 Unlocked Brand new as the ad stated on the website urgently so I can use it when traveling Overseas. unfortunately, instead I received the item in an open box broken seal which assumed to be used. The item has some minor problems such intermittent flickering and I have to tap hard on the screen to execute programs which I can live with since I have to leave out of country and don't have time to send it back and get another one. The problem was reported immediately after I received unit, but the seller never replied back. The shipping was good and delivered on time.                    I love this phone. I have been an Android phone user since they first came out, so I may be biased. However, this phone is FAST! It is very light and thin. It does everything I need and everything I can imagine needing.The greatest thing about Android phones is the extent to which they are customizable, so your experience will vary based on how well you can customize your phone and which apps you download and install. Whether it is business, game-play, travel, internet browsing, social media using, whatever.... You will be able to find apps that will accomplish what you need.The biggest draw back to this phone is that it is SLIPPERY! It will slide right out of your hand and onto the floor if you are not careful. And the screen is so thin and fragile that it will shatter if dropped at all.I highly recommend a rugged case for this phone to protect it. (That it also why I don't recommend that you spend too much on the phone, it has been out long enough that you should be able to find it for around $100 with a contract, or less).                    Before getting this phone, I have been an iPhone user since it was launched. I liked the ease of using the iphone but didn't like the fact that I didn't have flexibility in terms of adding memory or replacing battery. I didn't want to pay 100$ for 16Gb of memory when I can get it for $20. Also, the only problem I had with my iPhone was deteriorating battery life but there was no way of changing it expect paying the high charges. The intent of review is not to bash apple but as I have been an user I will compare the 2 phones. I have used the iPhone 4S, so can make a more recent comparison.- ease of useI think apple is still ahead in the area but not by much, There is a bit of learning curve with Android and it took me a couple of days to get used to it. Having said that, my 1 year old can unlock iphone but can't do the same with galaxy. Also, answering the phone is more intuitive on iPhone. However, one of the best features of galaxy is the drop down notification bar. I love that I can switch to the airplane mode or disable wifi w/o pressing 4 buttons. Also, iPhone fits better in smaller hands but for me galaxy is not a problem.- typingIf you have a smartphone, you will type and for me Samsung wins. The best feature is that it doesn't force auto-complete down your throat. It gives you word choices including what you are tying. I am bi-lingual and this is a great feature when I am using my mother tongue. Also, in the swype mode galaxy does a pretty good job of providing context based suggestions.- display and soundI don't care for retina display, galaxy is the winner for me. same for sound- battery lifethis is a tie. My wife's iPhone lasts longer even though she is a more heavy user but I can change mine :)- memory: samsung (read intro)- appsthis is a tie for me. I get most apps on both platforms and to be honest I am not a very app intensive person. I have about 25 apps in all- softwareiTunes wins, this isn't even a contest. Kies is pretty hopeless- photos:iPhone does a better job with stills and galaxy does a better job with movies. Galaxy really suffers when taking shots in the dark. The flash makes the pictures look a little weird color wise.- call qualitygalaxy is clearer for meOverall, I am having been using google products for many years now and for me android integration with google is a big plus.
!###This phoen is amazing... greta tecnology, easy to use and lots of multi functions...it comparable to a iphone, with the benefits you won't find at appple products (when you are tide to use apps, storage cards, etc)                    awesome,  its a gift for my wife....Hope she will like it too.....Thanks Hasslefree cell.........thanks for your quick customer feed back                    I live in Per&uacute;, this unlocked international version phone works perfectly.

!###This phone is really good!!!!. Only problem is battery life. If you are an app person; make sure you delete the unwanted apps that are loaded in cache once after the use. Because otherwise it hangs and doesn't respond so fast.                    ALTHOUGH I LOVE THE S3  THIS VENDOR SELLS ME A PHONE THAT IT'S MODIFIED AND I'VE BEEN THROUGH HELL TRYING TO UPDATE THE FIRMWARE.BOTTOM LINE THE PHONE IT'S AMAZING, GREAT DEAL, NO ISSUES WHATSOEVER (EXCEPT THE UPDATE TO 4.1.2 BUT IT'S NOT A SAMSUNG PROBLEM).                    It emits a &#34;ding&#34; sound every time an e-mail is received, DESPITE my having set sound notifications to &#34;Silent&#34;, I just don't how to stop this thing making this annoying noise!!  Otherwise, it seems like a perfectly adequate phone - I still prefer to do web surfing on a computer of some kind. The camera is OK. Sorry I don't get excited about technology any more, all these devices turn out to be more of a nuisance than a help.

At this time I can't use data on it for straight talk because it is a 4G phone but hopefully soon, just use the wifi. Also had to get my sim card cut to use but but that is ok as well.                    The major issue is that the battery does not last long enough. Just got the phone about a month ago and the battery barely lasts for a full day even with turning off most of the applications.                    The phone works fine when all of it's parts are attached.  The volume control button fell off almost immediately after we installed the SIM card in Italy.  It has many features, but the more things that are attached to an electronic device, the more there are to go wrong.  I'm going back to uncomplicated phones.  The simpler the better.  I bought an old Samsung burner phone in Naples for &#8364;19.90, and a TIM SIM card for &#8364;10, and it worked just fine all over Switzerland and Italy.                    I bought the Samsung galaxy s3 the first week of May. The phone was functioning perfectly, but two weeks later the phone suddenly died. It was never hit or scratch, always protected with a case. I took the phone to the technical service and they told me the motherboard was damage, without any reasonable explanation. I am really mad with the decision I took of buying this phone. Fixing the phone almost cost me the same as the new one. The damage is apparently caused by a software problem.                    It's a good phone. still in the top. It has some problems and bugs and I've heard about sudden death...                    It is the best purchase I have made until now. Although should lower the cost a bit. I really liked the product.
!###I owned a blackberry before I switched to the galaxy 3 and I'm never going back.  This is the best smartphone out there. The thing that caught my attention first was the large screen, this phone feels great in your hands and is easy to use.The only complaint I have is the battery life  but that could be my fault cause I cant put it down ;)This phone is a great buy!                    es el mejor tel&eacute;fono que existe en el mercado no tiene comparaci&oacute;n me gusta porque es tener toda la informaci&oacute;n de tu vida en un solo equipo                    The phone I purchased works perfectly with the carrier I intended to use it on. (Straight-talk)... The company sent me the SIM card, It took a few seconds to install... contacted straight-Talk with the required info... within an hour, phone and data were in full operation.Now I have a top of the line phone with an unlimited phone/data plan at only $46.00 a month... ( half the price  of other carriers. )                    Equipo muy moderno con muchas aplicaciones dise&ntilde;o elegante colores modernos cumple 100 % mis necesidades, lo unico malo es la poca duracion de la bateria                    The spcet of the product its not fair. I suppose it was a 4 g device, i didn't find the the right spec when i bought, but when came the valuation  from Amazon, about the purchase It was absolutily clear.  Why it was not clear before???                    That's the main question I asked myself. Which is the best? I've had the iphone since the 3G and had become some what bored with the slow pace of Apple incremental changes. Frustrated with Apple locking the user out of everything, forcing the use of itunes with no alternatives and hitting my pocket every chance they could, I broke down and bought the S3. It was love at first sight with the big screen, the many choices, the eye candy and many options. It is really more fun than the Iphone I thought. However, I must admit that the overall experience felt strange and a little confusing to me. I guess one could write it off as just being used to iphones. But I am computer savvy. After a couple of days I realized I was struggling with the extra size of the S3. I have fairly large hands and made more errors when texting and generally had to use two hands to navigate it most of the times. I did love the expansion sd card slot and removable battery, unlike iphones. Viewing movies  on the S3 is a breeze and you can download mp3s and movies through various apps. Android  is more open source for apps and some of those apps reminded me of viruses on Windows. Crazy popups and redirects. I had to download Norton just to get one stubborn little app to leave. I have to say that I feel much safer with Apple when it comes to security.I soon missed getting podcasts or using the dreaded itunes I loathed but have become familiar. I really missed using my iphone as a remote for Apple TV, which also allows easy viewing of my photos and videos wirelessly to my big screen television. Google play offered a few remote tv android apps for the S3  but they were subpar. One thing that really stood out to me was the fact that though I was disappointed with the iphone 5s very small screen stretch, I missed how natural the size felt in my hand. The iphone is much easier to navigate one handed, the S3 is top heavy imo, and tends to want to topple out when using one hand. Then it hit me. There really is not a clear winner between the iphone 5 and the S3. I purchased the S3 for $149 with a two year contract extension and saw it 3 days later at another store for $99 plus a $50 google play gift card. I figured the S4 may be released in a couple of months so I brought the S3 back to where I had bought it. I'm back to my iphone 4 and not obligated to At&t  anymore. And am quite content. I will be watching out for the S4 release and the iphone price drop and may get back on the merry go round. Really like both phones actually, but would clearly have to say that the iphone is much simpler for the user. The S3 may be a bit much for those who eschew learning curves, but has much more wow factor. Samsung is however winning the innovation race!                    se recomienda muy buen producto, llego a tiempo, tal cual lo que pedi fue lo que me llego muchas gracias.                    excelente equipo estoy satisfecho, es la version internacional,  y cumple con todas las expectativas, el costo inconparable para venezuela lo recomiendo                    anda bien, ya he comprado esa marca y funciona bien....estoy conforme con la compra y la forma de envio, gracias..                    Almost flawless in that it has only German text assistance available. Love the FM radio feature. Switching between a Wi-Fi and network connection to the same web station can be glitchy.
!###the phone is really good. but the screen flashes sometimes , but the price is ok. i like it. i got it on the second day i ordered it. it's cool!                    The smartphone is a proven and excellent performance, just the right size to not be uncomfortable. The only unfortunate thing is that I get my hands to open box without memory 16 gb micro sd. I feel so disappointed and cheated.                    To insert SIM card and Memory card battery needs to remove.very low quality body (very sensitive)Its having good software features and technology. comparing to all features its expensive.                    This S3 is bigger (but don't heavier), faster than S3 I owned.I receive this item one day before that I hoped.                    This product with very good and much more features and a easy keyboard to send a text. I loved this product                    I am very satisfied with the product, Samsung GT-I9300 Galaxy S III/S3 is excellent, the product is very original, the package arrived in good condition.                    I am pleased with my phone. What was shown is exactly what was received. I  have a serious problem with the carrier's delivery. It was not signed for but left outside. If someone had taken it would I have been reimbursed?                    This is good!!! I love this phone. And I will readily recommend it to anybody. I think the price too is good.                    `Veryh great awesome perfect cell phone that is at the edge of the technology it's was all as described and went fine                    buy the phone to this store because I thought that is one of the best, but when I open the package with the phone I find that the cell's logo is missing a letter.if this does not send it back because do not know if this phone is new or notfavorable position for an answerfarewellmarceloattached photo link cellhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/838/91um.jpg/
!###I bought a Samsung Galaxy SIII yesterday. I spent hours on the phone with their technical support trying to get their software, KIES, to sync with Outlook. They could not get it to work and referred me to Development Technical Support which never called back. If you need to connect with Outlook, I suggest you try another phone. This is not worth the effort. Otherwise, it is a good phone, but a good phone with no phone numbers is pretty worthless.                    I have never broken any of my previous smart phones or had problems with them. This is my first Samsung phone and my first Android phone.  I bought this phone 5 days ago and already the glass over the camera has shattered. This happened without any mistreatment, dropping, or irregular use. Samsung and phone carriers are not supportive of replacing the device, and it is difficult to find the glass to replace it (it is taking 1 month to order this piece of glass from China). The software on the phone is great. I am a big fan of Android, but I would look for a phone from a company that values quality control if I had to do this again. Definitely not worth the price tag.                    Because the reviews on the website, i bought it. but next time, i wont do it again.it acts very slow, even slower than S2, HTC, Moto Razer,iphone.I also have an iphone and HTC, but I got HTC in Asia, which is 5 times faster than S3, but they dont sell here for the 4 core.the only good thing is the pic resolution is better than S2, and battery life is little longer, but more expensive.disappointed.                    I replaced an ailing Iphone 4 that was two years old for the New Samsung Galaxy S3 and found it to be very disappointing. Though it does many things more than the iphone, the few things that a phone should do, don't compare to the performance of the Iphone. A swiss army knife is a poor substitute for a tool that does a few things well. Despite having a larger screen, I find the clarity and pixle density on the iphone to be better. The porcessor and ram are also better on the Samsung but you wouldn't know it by using them both. I couldn't find an easy way to shut down programs without opening various menus and had horrible battery life because of it. I ultimately just like the structure of the App store and IOS on Apple so much better. I also found that Flash doesn't work on the New Samsung so the only supposed plus over the iphone is false. I really thought that the competition was heating up against Apple but with this newest phone it looks like Apple is still ahead.                    Sorta Ok for apps, but who mashes a pie plate against an ear to make a phone call? Maybe Apple should make the iPad an iPhone?                    very bad and slow the lg optimus t is a lot better and cheaper. one drop on carpet and screen cracks                    I nicely ask them if i can get the product before xxx date and without asking me they canceled my order.What a terrible customer relationship.                    do i get the phone only or do i get the full box with the battery and everything else? Plus does the samsung vversion of siri really suck?
!###I like this better than the earlier iPhone 4s we have. It does consume power, but if turn off wifi and bluetooth, when I dont need it, it lasts for more time. I love the all the device integration features to connect to other blue tooth or wifi enabled devices. Although the connection to my car's bluetooth keep failing every now and then and I have to keep removing and adding the phone back to make it work. I wonder a software update will fix it. Pictures and movies look good. ALthough I will still stick to my DSLR for serious pictures. The integration to gmail, gtasks makes my life more organized.All in all, I am enjoying this phone !                    Excelente los telefonos y vendedores.. compre dos y los enviaron super rapido y en tiempo record... en venezuela con Movistar que es con quien tengo la linea funcionan super bien...es un telefono muy rapido.. lo mejor que ha salido                    There was some confusion because the description describes the North American S3. I ordered from Global Mobiles and received a S3 GT-I9300 unlocked from T-Mobile from Germany (or other German speaking country). The phone works great. Just recently upgraded to Jelly Bean via Kies update (no flashing or installing custom OS required). Awesome phone.                    I wanted to buy an IPhone but I changed my mind and bought this one. I am happy I did                    I am agree with this purchase, the item came in perfect conditions,  at time, the specifications are according with the product in the page                    Got my first android phone the galaxy s3. They were some customers complaining of receiving the American version which have the dual core processor instead of the quad core one, but I got the correct one. By the time I had gotten the phone the update for jelly bean was ready to be download and install, since it came with icecream sandwich. Over all I like the phone the only concern is battery life and I have taken some steps to try and fix that.                    Es mucho mas que un tel&eacute;fono, sus aplicaciones son fantasticas, es r&aacute;pido, estable y tiene excelentes gr&aacute;ficos. Fu&eacute; una buena compra.                    you must buy it! go go go now! you will be very glad with this smartphone all the app works really good                    It's great phone. Very intuitive. Nice sleek design and responsive touchscreen. Very easy to transfer files from pc and mac.                    I had zero problems with my transaction with seller. My phone arrived exactly when I was told it would and in perfect condition!It is EXACTLY what I ordered, and I couldn't be happier! The Galaxy S3 is an amazing phone, with fantastic battery life. I practically live with my phone attached to me for e-mails, texts, Tango and Skype video chatting, Facebooking, and so much more. I can run my phone ALL day long, from the time I get out of bed til I got to sleep and it still has battery life. I couldn't ask for more than that.My only complaint about this phone is with picture taking... my old phone had a button on the side that made it easy to hold and click for pictures. With the S3, you have to click in the lower middle phone screen to take a pic, and it's awkward to hold and click if you are taking a front facing picture. I am sure there is a work-around for this ONE minor issue, and I just haven't found it yet.Other than that... LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my phone. I've had it for a couple weeks now and wonder how I ever managed without it before. :)
!###I have to say this phone is the perfect mix between fashion and power, it's just an Awesome Phone!!!Samsung Congratulations                    I absolutely love my SIII. . size took a while getting used to though because I have small hands but all in all it was worth the buy.. The only other issue though was that the SIM card from my carrier was too big for the micro SIM slot, so I had to cut it down to size by removing the excess plastic surrounding it..                    I did a little research before buying, and now I have the feeling I made the right choice. Is a good product  for the right price.                    For me it was the best phone I ever had so far, great graphics, excellent performance. I recommend to all who are in search of a good phone.                    After using iPhones for a few years I was a little leary of switching to an Android phone, but the conversion was really easy.  There are some cool features on this phone like a "swipe" login.  There is no locator app but the Android store has Cerberus which is easy to setup.  It could be my imagination but downloads etc. seem faster that my iphone, even though both are on the same network.                    This is the best phone i ever had, it's just amazing how fast it is and how easy to use. like they said it's the Iphone Killer!                    hi ,i just want to say that i got the phone on time and in perfect shapethe only problem i have was that the charger was not consist with my country (i needed a EU charger and i got US)thanksido                    many reviews for this product, so i am simply talking about after the 4.1 update:now with the update to android 4.1 jellybean, this phone just got a whole lot better and faster.jellybean does not support adobe flash, but just search xda-developers or google and you will find a flash file compatible with the galaxy s3 on jellybean that works quite fine.this means just about all of the ice-cream sandwich features have been retained and the jellybean features have simply been added.also, samsung always makes sure that the experience remains consistent, so the learning curve from ics to jellybean is minimal.differences since upgrading to 4.1:longer battery lifesmoother scrollingfaster web browsergoogle nowmore available RAMuser experience has been polished on a wholethe only negative point is when u open the menu, there is a lag if u hit the widgets tab and start to scroll immediately, hurts my eyes, but besides that i can think of nothing else.5 stars deserved, good work samsung.if anyone has any questions, feel free to ask                    I had a great purchase experience! Plus the product delivers what it promises! I always had iPhones, but right now things seems easier to do and also much quicker, due to its processor. Off course it has its cons against the other phone, but still very good product. Only real bad thing about it is battery life, it is almost short as the other phone. When used in full capacity, 3G, checking emails, Facebook, Instagram and etc. the battery life won't last a full day. But the great thing about this phone is that gives you the option to have an extra battery. All in all it's worth it.                    I love this phone. Prefer it over the iPhone and other android phones. Very fast processor and calls are clear and have not dropped one yet. Pretty much same functionality of the iPhone but not as pricey.
!###3 mounths after buying it just start the problems .... i just went dead and then start working again and keep acting like this (i almost go crazy) ....i sent to assitance and first they say it was virus, then it was the power cable, then was the battery problem ...... always the phone come ok from the assitence and then after a couple of days it just stop working. Can samsung do not for me ? (i want a replacemento phone because is not my fault). Anyway the phone is not working right now and i lost my patient and  i am buying the nexus 4 and try it.                    the phone is damaged, have problems with the software, does not work, can not be used since it performs the functions of the phone, the phone is hung, suspended, frozen screen.                    Best Phone I had so far. Great screen, light, so easy to use, really frendly phone. Really recomend it to everyone.Exeeded my expectations.                    Was listed as very good condition. I was disappointed when I received my phone. IT works good, but had a lot of dents and scratches, and the screen has a small burn in the center of it. This is not the definition of very good condition.                    The phone was ok but, I did not meet completely my expectations because its case had been opened already. I really thought it was a brand new one.                    its ok, it did not have a micro-sim card so unable to make calls. disappointed with my purchased. too bad love samsung galaxies                    THIS SELLER Sold by Phoenix Smartphone & Tablet Repair. ITS THE BEST SELLER I EBAY I LOVE IT MY NEW PHONE GALAXY S3                    Would not recommend it.Heats up after 1 minute of video or phone call.Not as fast as I expected it to be.                    I have had the Galaxy S3 for over a year now and I love it more and more every day.  I manage all of my business and personal communications as well as Facebook Pages.                    I am happy with the phone but it did not come with English instructions and I was not able to obtain any when I called Samsung.
!###I haven't found a single flaw with this phone so far. I'm not going to go through all the functions because they're easily searchable, but they all work as advertised. The screen is very big, some people say too big, which seems ridiculous because its not like Samsung hide the screen dimensions until you buy the phone, the exact dimensions are available to everybody. The size and weight are well balanced and it fits nicely in the hand.And for all the people that complain that the phone breaks when you drop it onto concrete. Phones are not made to be dropped on concrete, it's not Samsung's fault that you dropped your phone. If they were to make the S3 as big as it is with an aluminium case you'd be complaining that phone is too heavy, if you're clumsy buy an iphone.                    I'll only comment on the fragility of the phone -- a pretty soft drop from two feet high onto concrete shattered the thin glass completely.  Much higher drops barely scratched my previous phone, a blackberry bold.  Beware, it must be kept in a case.                    I love how this phone feels like on everything.The device is TOO Powerful for this generation of smartphones which has a Quad Core CPU if anyone doesnt know what that means is that the CPU might say 1.5 GHz but its not if you multiply it by 4 its gonna be 6 GHz thats like a mini laptop.If your thinking to get this or the Iphone You have to think about Android or IOS if you dont like Android than go buy Iphone its that SIMPLE I myself hate wars between phones and other electronics because everything is on peoples opinions....Anyways Im happy with this phone its like a piece of nature.                    I have had many cellphones. This is the best phone that I have ever owned. The best thing about this phone is I don't think I'll have to buy a new phone for a long time.                    After a few weeks using the phone i can say, that this is very nice, powerful and pretty. The motion gestures are very nice for lots os things very well thought. The eye monitoring is helpful, the battery takes 1 and a half day easily full usage for work, but it can take longer a full business day even if you are a maniac =)                    I was delighted to replace my diminutive iphone, together with Apple's quirks and irritating restrictions, with an easy-to-read phone that is just the right size: neither small like the iphones, nor too large to fit in a shirt pocket. In addition, the wonderful Android OS allows me to drag and drop files and download apps without having to go through Apple's itunes straitjacket. I can find no fault in the Galaxy S3's performance and it's no wonder that its sales surpassed those of the iphone in August 2012. I simply can't wait for the upgrade of its OS to Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, which will further improve its already stellar performance.Update 6/13/'13: After a couple of firmware updates the phone seemed to acquire a life of its own. It reverts to the default ringtones for some contacts and for all its alarms. Sometimes when it restarts it goes into a Safe mode for no reason, so I have to restart it again. Finally, after a few minutes of use it overheats and freezes; to restart I need to remove and reinstall the battery. As for the 4.1 Jelly Bean upgrade, it was not as good as the 4.2 version which has not been delivered yet. In sum: after using it for 10 months my verdict is that it's hugely overpriced in view of its shortcomings.                    This phone lives up to all the hype. It's an amazing phone no matter which way you look at it. However, if your order is "Sold by Global Mobiles and Fulfilled by Amazon" you WILL get the unlocked INTERNATIONAL version of this phone. Global Mobile keeps posting their international versions here. The phone might work with AT&T (not sure) but if you're with T-Mobile, it will not be able to connect to the 4G network, and you will be roaming just about everywhere you go. (Apparently the International versions don't have the 1700MHz band that T-Mobile uses).Other than that, all the functions and features work, it feels amazing in your hands and the screen is just one of the best I've ever seen, next to my iPad, it stacks up very well.                    Pros:Awesome ScreenGreat soundIt's so thin!Awesome feel in the handSpeedyCompatible with ANYTHING!Cons:Screen is a little dimSound is a little softPenTile MatrixThis is a great phone and I recommend it to anyone who wants a good phone at a very solid price point.                    This phone does not work with Mac computers - connected via USB cable.  The downloaded driver and other directions from Samsung do not help at all.  I am using OS 10.8 and the phone has the latest Android 4.0.4.  I tried everything and looked on the web to correct the issue or work around it.  No luck.  Without such connection it is difficult to load any music on the phone.  Moreover if your car has USB connector to your sound system, most likely connecting this phone will not work on it as well.  It is really a shame because the phone is really sleek and nice, great responsiveness and good design.  Sorry but I am going to return the item and wait for iPhone 5 which hopefully, will save me all this headache.                    Snappy, sharp, sleek, this phone is a masterpiece in how much Samsung has packed into this thin device! If you travel the unlocked version is the way to go!
!###this device is awesome! no issues!probably only thing is I was so used to have the power button at the top... and volume buttons are trending more to the middle of the device instead of closer to the top... so when you put it in horizontal is easy to touch them unwillingly. But you can get used to it and it won't be a problem then. Not as a big issue to remove a star for it                    This cellphone is kind of expensive. However it has lots of useful features.It has some cons, for example S voice does not work as well as you may think based on the ads. also the battery discharges to fast, in my case it does not even last a whole day.                    After 10 month using this product it Dead suddenly -cause by 16G flash controller bug!! .this bug was fixed on 4.1.2 Jellybeansbut I was not having the opportunity to test that (Use 4.1.1 Jellybean).I ask the Dealer / Samsung costumer service for Help - no comments!!Switching to other manufacturing .....NO more Samsung.27/5/2013 - updateI just calling Samsung USA and It found to be a Hong Kong Hand set.So I call Hong Kong 0085236984698 help center and they confirm that because the Handset bought online it actually have ZERO (0) warranty . Amazon seller statement is that handset have 1 year warranty  with actually zero coverage.Thanks great way to sell product .I will look very carefully in the future (if ever) to buy a product using AMAZONThis is a bad bad experience - I just lost 876$ -thank you amazon - grate seller !!!                    I will not deny this is a great phone, looks good, works fast and everything is just stellar. But any of you fools that buy the international version like i did you will get a rude shock when you run into any issues with this devise.1) Samsung customer service USA will not be able to even trace your phone because the serial numbers are not synced to US numbers.2) You have to know which country your phone originated from and talk to their customer service for help. I have no idea? i could all 27 EU countries and see who recognizes it.3) Even a minor problem, like what i called to seek help on.. i have all my volume and tones set up and tested.. however when someone calls me.. the phone never rings, it will beep when you hit the keys to type a text but it does not beep or vibrate to let you know if you received a text, so there is clearly a problem with the alert issue.. even the alarm will not ring when set. Customer service USA will not help even with that let alone walk you through the motions.Conclusion.. Im sending this International version back.. buying the USA version and if ya'll are smart.. believe me now.. BUY AMERICAN! or you are doomed.. picture calling Greece or Poland every time something goes wrong is that even worth it? with the time zones and all.. I made a huge mistake.. i got this phone yesterday and its on its way back today! lesson learned.. BUY THE AMERICAN VERSION if you live in the USA.                    I bought this phone as a factory unlocked one. I received a T-mobile version which was unlocked but not the International version. The international version is much better that the US version. It so much faster when you stream on Youtube, and the screen is resolution is so much better. The international version is supported by a quad-core processor, not dual core as the US version. Don't be fooled by the fact that the US version comes with 2 gigs of RAM, because the quad-core processor of the International version still makes the performance much better even with one gig of RAM.I hate Amazon because I was fooled by one of its garbage sellers.                    Samsung has decided to roll its own MHL connector.  Which means the standard MHL connector you would use on any device will not work with the S3.  So you buy a fancy S3 phone that has MHL and you buy a MHL adapter for it.  Then you plug it into your TV and you do not get a working TV.I am going to guess the reason why they did this is to force S3 owners to buy MHL connectors only from Samsung.  That way they could charge a higher price and make a larger profit from the larger margin.  In short they want to charge you more and give you nothing in return.  I did some quick searches on MHL adapters on amazon.  The Samsung adapters for the S3 cost over twice the amount of MHL adapters for standard phones.  That means they are making well over double the profit.You can read a sight that talks about this here: [...]Samsung's only defense for their parasitic behavior is that they are adding capabilities to the connector by running the high def and usb over different pins.  But that doesn't stop them from using the standard connector.  The current manufacturers are running the high def connection over the same 5 pins of the usb connector.  Samsung just as easily could have made their connector work with both the standard MHL and their proprietary MHL.  That way if you buy a standard MHL connector it would work with the S3, but if you bought Samsung's improved MHL connector you would get more capabilities and therefor have reason for spending more.But they want to gut their customers, so they didn't.  Instead they made their connector proprietary and charged double for it.  It also seems they even chased competitors out of the market of producing a economically competitive version of their own connector.  Look at [...]  It would allow you to use a standard MHL connector with your proprietary S3 device for a low rate of $3.57.  That sure beats Samsung's markup of 100%.  But even this you can't have, it is "discontinued".  Samsung probably legally intimidated the manufacturer out of the market.  So buy a S3 and reward parasitic behavior, or shop another brand until Samsung comes to its senses...  I say shop another brand.  As for me, I didn't have a choice.  My company only offered me the choice of one android phone.  I had to choose the galaxy S3.                    I love my Galaxy S3.  I travel all over the world and haven't have a problem with it yet.  It took a little getting use to at first since I was a iPhone 4 user but I with the bigger screen and faster processor I've already forgotten about my iPhone.                    Battery life was always a disadvantage for iPhones and hence while switching over to a smart phone I decided I will get something really smart in terms of features, battery life and looks. The other day I saw the Samsung Galaxy S III advertisement while browsing through channels and I really liked the looks of it. Inorder to get a better understanding of the product I checked Amazon to get technical specifications. Satisfied I placed an order. My all new Samsung Galaxy S III arrived last week and here I am to talk about it. I have never seen a better screen resolution with any other phones. The operating system S3 is faster. Talk about the camera, the 8MP camera offers 20 shot burst mode and gives me the flexibility to choose the best photos among them.                    This is for the US-Verizon version, not unlocked version.This phone is so cool!I upgraded from LG Revolution, it's only been about an hour but I am very impressed. If you love gadgets, you must own this phone. S Voice has worked very well in my trials. The phone is beautiful, super-fast. I haven't found any problems yet, but I will update as I use it. The screen is huge, but the phone is very thin and light. So far, I just love it.
!###hi i just went to the tmobile retail store to see if this phone will work with tmobile 4g or LTE but they told me it only works on edge is there any possible to make it work 4g or LTE??and i also talk to call representative they said it can possibly work. whoever got this to work can you please help me??thanks =)                    Seriously. I've gone through two of these phones now. Last night while it was sitting in my pocket it cracked again. This phone might be fine in the delicate hands of a woman, but for a ham-fisted man like myself (and most men), it's a joke. A toy. It's too bad because otherwise the phone rocks with the exception of poor Bluetooth performance -- way worse than my Epic 4G. I'm off to get a Razr.                    The top of android smart phones, not an astounding Apple device but like PC does the work excellent and interfacing with all, recommended!!!                    This truly is a great device, but sadly I've received one that has the cellular problem.When making incoming or outgoing calls the phone will connect, but no sound is heard on either end. And if left connected for about 10 seconds the call will drop and I will loose connection from the cellular network for a min.I've searched high and low for a solution.. I've tried god knows how many different roms.. I've changed basebands.. factory reset, but no avail... the problem persists.Im certain that it's a hardware problem because if you tap the back of the phone you can sometimes hear the audio cutting in and out.From what I've read online the only solution is to send it back to Samsung, and apparently they change the motherboard... but thats a bit difficult in my situation as I live in the Cayman islands.Other than that pesky problem I love my s3.                    I love my T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S3 the best smart phone ever! The technology surpasses any out there and it is light years ahead of any Apple products.                    The phone software locks up all the time.  You'd think they would have taken the time to actually design programs to shut off when not in use-I have to go into the task manager all the time to shut down programs, sometimes programs i never selected to run, have been running.  There is always 8 programs running, that i have not selected, just to maintain the life of the battery.  Don't kid yourself with Juice Defender either.  It doesn't work.  Battery life?  Approximately 6 hours if you are lucky.                    NOT UNLOCKED PHONEWhen in Brazil it did not work although I went to a official Samsung place. They had to change the  IMEI and I paid more R$ 190,00 (around US 85,00)                    It hangs a lot poor quality, although international warranty helps.Over all battery life is goodAneroid upgrade is also a pain                    PHONE CALLS A COGIGO TO CONNECT INTERNET CAN NOT CONNECT CODE REQUIRES NO.SEND TO MY MAIL CODE WITHOUT CHANGING THE CLASSIFICATION OF A 5 1Star                    This was the worst  phone ever for the price. The picture quality was horable. I will be returning. Dont waste your money.
!###Good morning, the phone great, filled my expectations, but the charger came with the European terminal. not the U.S., to charge the phone I had to buy a power adapter European to American system. It is unfortunate.                    Excelente entrega a tiempo mercanc&iacute;a en buen estado era lo q yo esperaba y m&aacute;s tal cual ofrece en la publicaci&oacute;n lo recomiendo totalmente                    Se reinicia solo el telefono y no lo cubre la garantia de este comercio. . . . . .. . . . . . . . . .                    So I've had this phone for about 4 months now. It is the first smart phone I have had, I haven't even figured out how to do the touch sharing thing that they advertise the phone with. It's a pretty awesome phone but it does have some problemsFirst off, the screen freezes. It doesn't happen very often, maybe once a month since I've owned it. I don't know if that is something that happens with all smart phones, but apparently, it needs to be restarted every once in awhile. It doesn't seem to make a difference if I have the phone off for a few hours every day, since I turn it off while I'm at work or in class. I've talked to other s3 owners and the same thing happens to them as well.I don't know if this is the phone or the provider (T-Mobile) but sometimes my phone won't receive service. This happens more often than the screen freezing, restarting the device seems to fix this problem as well-which leads me to believe that it's more the phone than the provider. This one annoys me more than the screen freezing because I've missed several important calls due to this problem. Technology is making it possible to do all kinds of amazing things, but we shouldn't be moving backwards. A phone should still have the ability to make and receive phone calls.They break REALLY easy. Mine hasn't broken but I have a cover and screen protector on it. I have two friends with s3s that they were using without covers and both of them have cracked the screen. One of them cracked while it was in my friend's pocket. He doesn't know how it happened. So if you're going to buy this phone, I strongly recommend a cover and screen protector.Overall, I like the phone and what it is capable of doing but with that kind of drawbacks, I think I'd rather go back to having a simple phone.                    I bought this phone and paid for one day shipping. Took a week to show up. took this phone to my wireless provider and was told it was not supported by their system and was told only ATT was compatible. went home and started searching on the net and most reviews I found said it was not very compatible with ATT so returned phone                    So faster and confortable i bought it and in two weeks i recived it, work vert good and so easy to use                    el telefono llego en excelentes condiciones y em el tiempo esperado... muy buen servicio............ ... ... .. .. .. ..                    facil entrega muy responsables a la hora del envio.excelente producto.muy buena calidad.buen precio y seguridad en el estado en que llego el producto                    It seems that everybody is pretty ecstatic with this phone, and indeed it looks great on a picture. However, if you put it next to an HTC One X or iPhone 5 in real life you will immediately notice the underwhelming build quality and the less-than-satisfactory UI.As far as hardware goes, battery capacity, etc. the phone may currently be a great contender for the No 1 spot, but Samsung have really dropped the ball with regards to its design and the quality of materials used. Unless you are a great lover of plastic (albeit shiny) it is difficult to fall in love with Galaxy S III.HTC One X has a short battery life and iPhone 5 costs an arm and a leg in Europe (not to mention Apple's control-freak approach to its customers), but Samsung is not cheap either, and it is difficult to spend that kind of money on an item you do not truly like.                    excelente vendedor todo se realizo como lo describe y el producto excelente este vendedor lo recomiendo los envio son rapidos y seguro
!###Placed the phone on the kitchen counter, walked away for 10 minutes, and when I returned the glass was shattered. Prior to this the phone had never been dropped and was getting light use. Naturally, Samsung won't accept that the glass broke WITHOUT CAUSE! When it comes to broken glass the customer is always to blame. So, I'm screwed and have to eat it. However...I don't have to by a Samsung phone next time.I suggest you do an internet search of "Samsung Galaxy S3 glass defect" and see what you find before you by this phone.                    I purchased this because my Galaxy 1 (aka the Vibrant) was slow and unreliable and because Samsung and/or T-Mobile decided to quit updating the OS. What I really wanted was a faster and more reliable version of the Vibrant with a nicer camera and a GPS that actually works. This phone has met those goals BUT between samsung throwing in every half assed app they could think of and google sinking it's social and "play" media hooks in, there are like 30 programs on this phone that I'm never going to use and can't delete. Because it's awesome not to be able to rid yourself of things you're never going to use.It's also constantly trying to teach me how to shake my phone and flip it around to accomplish some asinine purpose. Every item called a "feature" under the product description is completely pointless, especially the touted S-Voice.That said, once I turn off all the annoying crap I'm sure the phone will eventually be pretty sweet.                    Es un excelente tel&eacute;fono, me encanta el dise&ntilde;o, en cuanto rendimiento es s&uacute;per r&aacute;pido, el software est&aacute; muy bien acabado, la interfaz grafica es muy buena, el S3 no calienta tanto como el S2, y le dura m&aacute;s la bater&iacute;a. Lo recomiendo mucho.                    I used to own a Galaxy S2 and since it was excellent i decided to buy the S3 which is more than excellent.This is the QuadCore version which works perfect.I would like to say more, but i think that a video in youtube is better to describe how excellent is this phone.About the battery, it is alsmot 50% better than the Galaxy S2.Apple has nothing to do against this one because the S3 is very focused in sharing (info, pics, music, etc etc etc) and on the other hand, the mentality of Apple is Anti-Sharing.                    Galaxy S3 Broken Screen.... A SECOND Time... Not a Coincidence...So, I'm on my 2nd SPH-L170 Galaxy S3 phone from Samsung. The first time to no avail, I went to Asurion (Sprint's Insurance Provider) for replacement.. Paid my $150 and got another one.The screen on the first phone cracked within the first 7 days. Didn't drop it. Just cracked. I suggested manufacturers defect etc, but you never know.. maybe I didn't handle it delicately enough? Maybe I should have carried the phone around wrapped in Bubble Wrap? Not sure.. But I can tell you my wife's Iphone 4s has been through drop after drop after drop and hey... it works perfectly..And of course I have a Case surrounding my Galaxy 3 that was recommended by the Sprint Store representative to essentially keep the phone from having a cracked Screen.. But, of course it broke.By the way, did you know that when you buy a Smartphone, the ONLY warranty from your Carrier or Insurance Company only covers the Electronics and Software?  So, if you buy the phone, walk out of the store and the screen cracks, it's Not Covered unless you send it to the Manufacturer for 3 weeks for a decision from them on replacement.. And while you're waiting, Sprint doesn't offer you a Loaner or Replacement.. Thus, they Con you into using the Insurance they charge $8 a month for..Now, yet again, my Assurion Replacement phone cracked in front of my VERY eyes this morning. I pushed the HOME button at the bottom of the screen and guess what happened.. It cracked. Take a look at it.. It's awesome... Maybe I'm not supposed to push the ONE button on the Front Screen? Is it there for decoration? Maybe I should have had the phone in the Google Voice mode where you talk to it and never touch the front of the screen? Don't know.. but I do know one this so far.. Spoke to 3 Sprint representatives and they told me to go fly a Kite.. They are not standing behind the Products they are distributing.. Then I said to each Sprint Rep including a Team Leader and a Supervisor in location B56 by the name of Jason, that I googled my device model and found numerous complaints around the same issue. Guess what Sprint.. there are a lot of people out there with the same problem.. Stand behind the products you are distributing or don't sell them. I'm going to keep the links off this post for now.. Maybe Sprint will read my post and consider standing behind this.. if Not, I'm going to copy at least 3 of the links that show this problem happens a lot and that the screen is breaking/cracking essentially all by itslef because the users (me included) are not carrying around our Galaxy S3 in bubble wrap.. And I wouldn't be surprised if that didn't fix the problem either.Apple stands behind their products.. Verizon (a friend of mine has Verizon Platinum support and the same issue and Verizon simply replaced the phone, no questions asked)... Should we swithc to a carrier that cares?                    This is the second phone I brought, I brought the first one for my husband in December for Christmas it worked just fine. About two months later he accidentally dropped it in the ocean, since he was happy with it was a no brainer I went back to Amazon and make sure I brought another one from the same seller. I basically brought the same phone, unfortunately the phone has been nothing but problems, they is something major wrong with the wireless setting. We called the seller and have been placed on hold until I got tired. I AM NEVER BUYING ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN                    It Works perfectly! I brought it to Venezuela and everything is perfect! Im very excited with this new pone. Very good                    After 3 months own this phone. It start to have some issue first the phone seem to get very hot when I'm using the gps or play games my galaxy 2 didn't do that before,2nd when I make the call or people call in I can hear them very well but they can not hear me ? battery life seem to get shorter and atlast the charger port not able to take charge i have to move the plud up and down until it connected. Got the new replacement in two week but still have the same isuue now I'm waiting for the 3rd . three time the charms i hope for better luck this time.                    About a month after purchasing the phone I knocked it off of my coffee table onto a hardwood floor and the screen cracked. This was an 18" drop onto wood and the screen broke.I've seen some of the cheaper repairs for the phone where just the glass is replaced and the end result isn't very good, the screen looks cloudy afterwards. Someone I work with had this done.The screen replacement, that Samsung performs, looks to be about $300, might as well just purchase a sturdier phone (any phone other than the S3) so that I'm not going through this in another month.The phone is also a little big for jean pockets.On the plus side, the phone is very responsive, takes good pictures, and has a very nice screen (until it breaks).                    Well it will be a shame comparing this monster to the iPhone.Apart from the shape and design (which we may disagree upon) it beats it in every shot.Looking forwards for the upcoming S IV
!###bought this as a continuum to my galaxy . my old phone was so ruggedly used without a cover.sadly, I overestimated this new product, its the bad sheep of the galaxy family and the screen broke with the first fall it faced! My old Galaxy had at the most a dent with similar fall.replacement of the not original screen is 170$ min!! not happy at all :'(                    The samsung galaxy s 3 looks awesome it is lighter than expected but fun to use. It has too many apps which i dont understand why we need them all also the boring part is tht u need id for every app .....                    I tested this last week and I love its feature, I owned Samsung galaxy fit smartphone and iphone 3gs. I like to replace my iphone 3gs soon and may consider Samsung galaxy s4 just in case apple can't come out with a bigger screen iphone.                    Todo excelente con el producto enviado. muchas gracias el envio fue perfecto. llego de muy buena manera al pais. ok                    The best quality smartphone. incredible functionality and unbeatable operating system. I highly recommend if you want quality products for communication and distraction. unsurpassed quality.                    The phone is everything I expected and more, arrived within stated time.  It was my birthday gift and I am really pleased so far.                    The best phone I ever had. The best phone in the world! I hate the I-phone! !! You must to buy this product!                    The galaxy s III is without a doubt the best phone you can get. It wins over the competition in any measurable aspect.                    Great phone but it does too much. I wont use half of the capability of this phone nor would I waste my time trying to figure it out. It also is a battery hog with so many things running. There is a point where less is more and we finally reached that point. I sort of miss my htc inspire. Be prepared to have spare batteries or have a charger with you where ever you go. On a recent trip to Florida we could not use the phone as much as we needed to because the battery life is so short.                    Received the item on time as promised on the 8th of Feb. however due to personal tragedy in my family, i have still to connect and operate the smartphone Samsung Galaxy S III/S3. I'll comment and review at a later date...BTW, I DIDN'T RECEIVE THREE OF THE OTHER ITEMS I ORDERED.
!###The battery did not even fit into the phone.  I suspect that this is not a genuine Samsung Galaxy S3.  Beware!                    This phone suddenly stop working one minute, this is a common problem with this model, I tried to use the warranty and Samsung Latinoamerica just told me that they can't accept my phone because it has a scratch on the plastic and the Warranty is voided.If you are thinking about this phone please buy a HTC. Much better quality!!!                    I have had several smart phones, but this one is in a class of its own. I can live with a glitch or two but this is ridiculous.  I hear the angry birds theme music when making phone calls. I CAN NOT share my location.  When texting phone opens random apps. When selecting people from my favorites list in contacts it calls my cousin from MN, no matter who I select.  Hell, I've been working on this review for 20minutes. It keeps closing this page and opening my alarm clock that I can't seem to shut off. I HATE this phone.                    The look and feel of the phone is like none other. It is thin, light, and really really powerful.Software:It has some really advanced features such as automatic face tagging, turn over to pause, and more but I find that I really don't use those features as much as I thought I would especially since they are they aren't fully mature (ex: I have tagged my wife's face at least 3 different time and it still doesn't work). As a result, I don't use the "cutting edge" features as much as much as I thought I would. However, the phone excels with the day to day features that even gives my tablet trouble (my tablet Asus Transformer reboots almost 2 times/day. My cellphone, none :-)).Reception:My wife has an Evo 3D, we have also owned an LG Optimus, and Blackberry's have all have had 5 bars reception whereas my Galaxy S3 only gets 1-3 bars, mostly 2.Conclusion:Overall, I really like the phone despite the reception issues. I have never owned an Android phone in which I got to truly experience a seamless Android experience before I had the Galaxy S3. Might I also mention that this is the best looking phone in the market and it feels great to hold.                    I bought it a week ago. I've never had a cell this fast. Auto dial is a great feature. Tons of memory and proccessing power. Headphones show good bass and high frequencies. Even the front camera has nice quality. I'm still discovering it, but I think this beast is very promising.                    This phone has a Pentile display. For every day stuff it's fine. BUT if you plan on using your phone to do a lot of reading then stick to the S II or another phone. I went back to the S II after having difficulties reading for an extended period of time on this display.                    I had got my Samsung Galaxy S3 a month ago from amazon...it was my first product to buy from amazon..and bought it from seller stylevie ...they packed and shipped it very carefully!!Now about the product...It was awesome phone to have...some what like little computer..lolSCREEN : Thanx to Gorilla glass...the scratches were not caught on screen atol..but better to have a screen protecter and a good case to avoid any damage..becoz i dropped it two times :P but nothing happened becoz of case :)TOUCH: The touch was buttery smooth u'll njoy it!!CAMERA: -The camera was also too good and take pictures very clearly and 1080p video quality was also excellent with continues auto focus (and can take good pictures while recording video). -The front camera also takes 720P video!!!!! :DBATTERY: It'll take around 2 1/2 (2.5 hrs)for fully charging from 0 to 100%...and it will be run for about 14hrs with more usage and it lasts for a day by normal usage....there was power saving mode option and u can increase its running time...HEATING UP: Not at all, u see S3 doest heat soo much as it was heated in S2....if u use mobile for hours by playing games ,watching videos or browsing net there will be a very little heat at downpart of the phoneSOFTWARE : As u know Icecream sandwich was really excellent and running good on s3 and the jellybean update will be coming in a few months too!!!!!!CONNECTIVITY : The bluetooth version is 4.0 which is very latest...there is wi-fi...u can connect to usb's using a USB on the go cable...and u can also connect to specially designed keyboards , mouse ,...etc.,PERFORMANCE : It is a quad core processor!!!! no lags atol and and it was smooth while scrolling even more than dozen of apps are running... :DFEATURES: -It has many features like s-voice , s-beam , pop-up play etc., The S-voice was also good like apple's siri :)-The S-beam was also good ....and i like very much the feature called pop up play....u can pop up video that is playing and u can keep the video any where u want on the big screen.It was not laggy and was so smooth to move over the screen and can simultaneously can do texting browse net etc.,-when we open video player u can see thumbnails playing a little preview of video and u can easily select the video u  want :)-samsung touchwiz also very good :)-slide ur hand on screen and take screenshot-tap on top to move to top of the list u r scrolling , smart stay , Direct call....what can i say there were many features like these..! :DDISPLAY : It was 720P resolution display which is very nice to view videos,while playing games etc.,...however in sunlight there will be little dissapointment...but keeping the brightness to full u can see even bright light :)APPS: U have tons of apps in google play store...and the HD games which have more size also run very smooth.. :)STORAGE: I have 16gb internal memory(11Gb available for storage) which is enough :)But i bought another 32GB external memory card...now my storage was huge(48GB)!!!!!!!while installing apps..app2sd was not working at present which is used to install apps to sd cardso i loaded music videos and other stuff to sd card and installed apps on phone memory so that i can manage perfectly :)POCKETABILITY:The S3 was a big phone .its about 5 inch mobile ....first i doubted whether it fits perfectly in my pocket...when i kept my phone in pocket(jeans or normal) it fits perfectly!!!! The phone was thin and happily fits in pocket no worries :)  Finally i can say onething Samsung Galaxy S3 was an awesome phone to have and its a Beast!!!!!!!!!! :D :)                    The phone I bought is a "Samsung Galaxy S III/S3 GT-I9300 Factory Unlocked Phone - International Version (Pebble Blue)".  The phone I received is a Samsung Galaxy S III / SGH-I747, installed with a GT-I9300 old firmware version.  As a result, the phone had a poor screen resolution and a very poor camera performance and a lot of bugs in applications.  When I tried to update the software to the recent Android 4.1.2 firmware version the phone died and was very hard to discover why.The phone works fine with its original SGH-I747 firmware and don't understand why they changed to GT-I9300.                    There is NO warranty on this phone. It died of a (now documented) sudden death after the Amazon return period. Samsung USA will not service it. Calls to England resulted in a message that it would not be serviced since the item was purchased in the US. Because this is the international version not sold in the US Samsung will not service it here.I will never buy another Samsung product since they will not stand behind it. This was a rip off of over $500 and Amazon will not help.It  wouid be best if Amazon refused to sell Samsung products. Very,very unhappy. Feel cheated.There is no warranty at all.The problem I HAD IS also with the vendor, BLUTEKUSA. They do not care if the items they sell have no warranty, nor do they trouble themselves to alert potential buyers to this fact; BLUTEKUSA did not:(1) Advise purchasers in the U.S. that because this was not an item supported by Samsung USA that there was no warranty that comes with the product(2) That a third party warranty was available.I wish AMAZON.COM that provides excellent service to its customers, would REMOVE  BLUTEKUSA from its companies that make products available on the Amazon site. Unlike BlUTEKUSA, Amazon does not take BLUTEKUSA'S "caveat Emptor" philosophy but wishes to please customer.BLUTEKUSA WROTE ME: 'Just so you know, thousands of customers have purchased this item from us and many of them were able to follow through with their warranty in the country of origin. Some have worked with Samsung in the Czech Republic, Italy, Germany, and numerous other destinations. Many other customers, knowing that they were purchasing an international version of the item, purchased third party warranties through Square Trade, Geek Squad, and other such companies in the industry to make sure that they were covered in the US. We cannot take responsibility for an item purchased so long ago as we do not get anything to uphold other companies' warranties. If the company decides to void their own warranty, for whatever reason, that is not something that we are able to uphold. A Motorola phone that I owned stopped working one day and when it was sent to them, they stated that the phone was water damaged. There was no water damage when the phone left my possession but that was their reason to void the warranty. So, I do understand your frustration and there is a manufacturer that backs us to uphold their warranties but, unfortunately, Samsung does not. We are very sorry for any issue this may have caused you but please feel free to contact us if you have any other questions or concerns."WOULD NOT IT HAVE BEEN NICE TO HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT THERE WAS NO WARRANTY ON THIS PRODUCT IF PURCHASED IN THE US, BUT THIRD PARTY WARRANTIES WERE AVAILABLE?NICE OF THE REPRESENTATIVE to slam Motorola without documentation. .
!###This my feedback claim related to this product:The positive:* Great design / great operative system* I receive a SGH-T999 model with 1.5GHz processor dual core 1.5GH & 2 GB RAM NOT A 4G LTE device , but it very fast even it is not quad core* In addition you I receive 48GB free space for 2 years in Drop BoxThe negative:* No headphones included in the box* Reliability: After full charging I start using it with no problems but for some reason the device does not power on randomly even if it has more than 70% battery. In order to wake the phone up I have to plug in the charger line a moment and then the phone is ok and I'm able to use again. This happens randomly, but I am losing my calls when the phone doesn't wake up. I been using the same operative system (Android) in other devices more than a year for this reason I am sure something is going wrong (In my case the supplier is abe-123)* Unlocked Issues: The reason I search for unlock devices is because I am free to get full benefits from manufactured. This phone it's a T-Mobile branded device for this reason it has a custom made operative system (ICS) and not the original stock operative system from Samsung and will never get officially updates (stock ROM'S) and it has function that I am not able to use in my country  but consuming my resources (memory & processor). This is not really an unlocked device* Notice that is not possible to move applications to the external memory like other devices (micro SDHC)                    I got this phone is late July and the PHONE has been amazing. I love every aspect of it, it's very fast the UI is very user friendly and I enjoyed using it...EXCEPT for the awful battery. Phone takes sometimes 10 hours to charge and has not lasted for 9 hours since I've used it. Sometimes the battery won't charge when I plug it and and I have to remove the battery. I have been contacting the seller Open Group Wireless for weeks trying to get a new phone and they have done nothing but give me the run around. WHEN they answer my emails it's always asking me what's wrong like I haven't told them a million times and asking for my order ID number that I have also sent a million times. I am so frustrated with this company and this phone's battery. All I'm asking is for a device that works the way it's supposed to. I am giving this a bad rating not because the phone sucks, but because the seller does.                    I sent another version was not the version of the ad sent me the version of the T777 and not international version i9300  that was written in the announcement the i9300 and sent me another product !!                    It has very bad battery. It takes more than 48 hours to get fully charged. It gets empty in 2 hours.                    I think the phone is a good phone but the seller on Amazon give me a bad deal with the phone because it is not holding the charge for any long period of time.                    The phone is not unlocked, which I could not use it. When you send a message to the seller who replied me, I'm still waiting for the key to unlock. Not recommend since I was buying a phone unlocked and it is not.                    the device doesn't work on the 1700 band which is T-Mobile's 4g network (USA)You will see E,G,3G,H,H+ , all these are very slow compared to true 4g.If data speed is important to you make sure to order the specific model that works with your carrier.                    I live outside the USA, and I ordered the international version of Samsung Galaxy SIII phone. They said very clearly that it was unlocked. That&#8217;s why I bought it. I asked them to send it to my relatives' address to bring it to me on their vacation. I was happy that it arrived on time. But I was really disappointed to find out that it was locked
!###I bought mine from a seller called &#34;Top10Cell&#34;. Received a real Galaxy S3 GT-I9300. Appears to be new. The seal looks a little fishy, like it was broken but someone sticked another seal on the broken one. But the phone is totally fine. But everything that came, came in French, including the phone's default language, so I had to change it, no big deal though, since you can find the user manual on Samsung website. The phone, as most phones do, came with a bunch of rubbish apps that can't be deleted (unless you root it). Everything seems fine to me, except for some reason I can't update my Android. Tried Kies and OTA, both failed. Might consider rooting it.Overall a worthy buy. I owned an Exhibit II but its battery started swelling and the phone is getting too annoyingly slow, so I bought this S3 with $400. The screen resolution is so much higher, and I love the big screen. Btw the phone is very light, even lighter than then smaller Exhibit II. For those who complained about its &#34;cheap plastic cover&#34;, I don't think that is cheap plastic, I think the material is chosen for its low weight. But a case, that will solves the problem.It came with a samsung earphones, which is not bad (worth more than $10). Charger's plug is not American style, but you can always charge it with a computer.Yeah! Hope it will stay with me for at least three years!                    I'm owner of one Pebble blue S3 i9300, everything was fine, but 2 months and half, touch buttons stop to work, the phone doesn't have warranty, and in one phone service shop I pay 20$ to repair it, and 10 days later buttons again stop to work, this is the problem of mine, but everything another is okay - it's onlock, it's i9300, was in perfect condition - like from store brand new. Peoples, you must to know, for this money, do not expect too much, if someone want to be like in store, to have warranty and to be unlock go in store and pay 100 dollars more :)                    I am upset with this phone because I didn't even get a chance to use it.  Do not purchase this phone, I repeat Do not purchase this phone.  The description clearly states UNLOCKED INTERNATIONAL VERSION.  that is the main reason why i purchased it. When I received the phone and put in the sim card, the phone was locked. I am mad as hell because I was very excited about the S3, but was shocked and disappointed when I could not get it to work.  I tried contact the seller and all I was told was to return it, what  a joke.  I feel very decieved                    I switched from iPhone to this phone, and i love it! It has way more features than even the new iPhones and the bigger screen is also very nice. It was easy to set up with a T-Mobile SIM that i bought at Wal-Mart. This phone was so much cheaper than anywhere else (Best buy, Radio Shack ECT...) I was originally reluctant to buy it because i thought it would be a fake. But this phone most definitely not a fake. But this phone does not support 4G LTE like the i9305's they sell at stores, but i don't even have LTE in my area so for 200 dollars less it wasn't a big trade off. It's an awesome phone for a great price and i would definitely recommend it to a friend.                    This was a gift for my wife and now she is very happy with the mobile phone because it has better performance her old mobile phone.                    Excellent smartphone. Easy to use.  This was a birthday present for my 14 years old daughter and she loved it. It worths every dollar.                    Works perfect with my Metro PCS account. The phone works as advertised, it is unlocked but not jailbroken, no problems at all.                    Good product, nice price , works great  & arrived on time. thanks, just the plugin is for Europe but the sent me the adapter for it.                    Is the best cellular phone have never owner, is easy, friendly,  more functions, the only problem is the battery need more live time                    hello i just received this phone and im loving it to max. Its every thing that it stated it would. i would buy this item again.
!###Excelent phone!! Highly recomended especially if it will be used in Venezuela. Works great!! Really happy to have made the change.                    It met my expectation and I can recommend it to others. I wish it was cheaper though - the price I paid is equal to buying the phone from AT&T.                    Good product! Fast process four core! Battery long duration, according to specification to manufacturer, I recommend this product. Good price.                    I did not really consider the consequence of having ordered an international version of the phone. This made me a little nervous once it had been shipped. So far, there is no problem at all. For others.considering this type of phone be aware that you will need an international SIM card. The SIM is smaller than the US version. I was able to order a new SIM from ATT at no charge (surprisingly). I do not have it yet. The phone is supposed to be factory unlocked and I am going to assume that it is. I will not be able to verify it until I get the SIM.The phone  (being an international version) uses French rather than English as the default language but I was able to navigate.it with little problem.I like the phone very much so far. The keyboard is easy to use, the back cover snaps off and on easily. I like the weight and the way it feels.                    Great phone, it worjed very well snd happy to have it so happy. I am glad that I bought it                    Great smart phone. Cost / performanc is unbeatable. If you prefer Android this phone is one ofvthe best.Cheers,Ron K                    As far as now the  product it's working as planned. Fully recomended. I hope keep's working perfectly well. Cheers friends                    I'm so happy with my Samsung Glaxy S3, It's in excelents conditions, that's new. I recommend this store. I'm so happy.                    It talks, surf and also take excellent pictures. Personally, I like the photos more than the ones that I take with my iphone 4, 5.I recommend this product, and my only concern is about the OS. Android, ok it good enough and have a lot of nice tools. The things that you can do with the keyboard are great. However, do you know, the IOS is just press the button, which is much more simple.                    exellent thanks very good cellphone my friend ! i don`t know so much english jeje.. I am sorry, s3 good
!###Thank you this program work for what I needed. I want to thank the agent for helping me save money.                    it is good fast response and easily usable. it can be open and closed easily and I can go through any requirement in few seconds.                    Bought this phone for my husband to use overseas. He loves it and it works great. He now prefers it over the i-phone.                    just what I need, a smartphone with that kind of program that is to many friendly. the conection with the  world.                    the phone was in great condition but part of the package was that it would come with the charger but it didnt it came with the old ipod charger instead!                    Excellent product, the product is as it as it was published, I had no problem with it and it works great, just had to putting on the sim card, fully recommended, no complaints, thank you very much                    excellent product. meets all my expectations. great attention by the seller. Recommended widely. completely satisfied with the purchase. again recommend                    El mejor cel del mundo. Por lo menos hasta que tenga el S4... Muy buena atenci&oacute;n a la hora de la venta                    was the best choice  that i made!! good product i recommend it and i will buy again to him .                    its one of the better phone that i had its a same product that the samsung 4 but its better price
!###I love the molding of this phone externally as well as the improvements on features as far as texting, and video.  For everything I use this phone with I am greatly pleased.  I am curious what "major" improvements are left on phone technology but am looking forward to future Samsung items due to how happy I am with this unit.                    Great phone love it and got the flip cover for it. Easy to use and is really the hot item out there now when it comes to smart phones.                    Very fast and smooth, very well designed. I love its big screen. I had a SGSII but SGSIII is better so far it has many features that you will love.                    It's a great phone much cheaper but with a lot more features than the carriers branded phone. GALAXY S3 INTERNATIONAL!  GREAT DEAL GREAT SERVICES! GO 4 IT !                    I finally got my SIII and wow! It's all I expected it to be and more. I am doing stuff that I never thought would be done on a phone.I love it!!!!!!!!!!!                    i had bought this product by looking that its a factory unlocked but as i received the product it was  taken in plan and later unlocked where i am unable to use certain applications like GPS. i had loved the product but i felt i was falsely persuaded to buy this product.. i suggest you to b very careful and also beware of seller before buying too.. Samsung Galaxy S III / S3 Unlocked GSM Smart Phone (Pebble Blue)                    This review is for both the phone and the store.after 4 hours of using the S3, the phone fell from me and the screen is not working any more.It was an easy fall though.The store:-I contacted the store directly. They direct me to CPR store in mountain view,CA and they told me that the store will fix it for free if it is not a physical damage. but guess what, the technician said we do not know them!!!!!!- I ask them if i can take it to samsung US they told me you can. when i contacted samsung US,They said they do not support the international phone version.- I contacted Hassel free again they said ooh you should contact Samsung UK :(Samsung:-I contact samsung US they said that the phone is not under thier warranty, they support only the phone that is only for the US market?? "I think what i have is a samsung phone" and they gave me a number to contact.guess what the number was fake!!! hahahaha- I go to chat with their ******* support team, they direct me to samsung India.- Samsung India said we do not support the device hahahaha.- I contacted the store again and they direct me to samsung UK.samsung UK told me to send the device to UK whith me paying for the shipping?? what a customer service.the conclusion is the follwing:- The store FOOL US on not showing that the device is supported ONLY in UK.- Samsung customer service IS Horrible, why do not they support their products where ever it is purchased from.ALL of the above is documented if any one need to learn about the issue furthermore.                                  I've received the item yesterday and was really disappointed. The manufacture seal was broken and I can't accept it. It's a rule. I ordered the brand new one, so it must be sealed. I am returning the phone, unfortunately.                    There are a number of important details that do not appear in the publication, such as the model that really sells T-mobile SGH-T999 and not the GT-I9300 International Version. No doubt the GT-I9300 is better. Therefore it is not the phone that is published.                    compre  el telefono samsumg S3, desbloqueado y no esta desbloqueado y necesito el c&oacute;digo de desbloqueo para poder usarlo aqui en venezuela con la telefonia movistar
!###It's amazing, its form factor, the big bright screen, the battery life... but I noticed it gets kinda slow when there are a few apps runnin at the same time, it didn't happen to me with my iPhone 4S.                    Even though I love this phone I am starting to realize that the battery only lasts for a half day.  I wonder why. When I had the Samsung Brightside battery life was pretty where the battery lasted for 2 days.  I have to charge this phone everyday and all day which is a bummer.  The battery  life on this phone is very weak.This is my second Samsung phone that I own.  Samsung makes great phones IMO.  I have never had a problem with them.  At first I had the Samsung Brightside with a slide out keyboard but decided to switch up to a complete touchscreen with no keyboard.  This phone is quite large and the screen is nice.  It is very wide and clear.When I first got this phone I was kind of surprised at how thin it was (it felt paper thin).  The phone is very flat and slim but the beautiful touch screen makes up for it.  I would recommend a phone cover to support its' slim weight.  The phone also came with headphones which was nice.The home screen displays the time day, date and the weather in your current city.  I really like that feature.  Other than that the phone has your typical features, such as youtube, internet, you can download games and music, camera, video, etc.The graphics is really clear on the screen.  If you look at videos on this phone such as youtube it is a little fuzzy but not bad.  Another feature I like on the phone is the lock screen.  When you touch it, it is like it is incased with water.  The camera is good also.  The picture quality is clear.The keyboard is excellent on this phone.  Every time you type on it, it has a water drop effect.  The touch screen and keyboard feels very nice.Overall this is a good phone.  I really like it and it is worth the money.                    If you are considering purchasing this phone do it! I have gone through more phones since my sophomore of high school, when I got my first "smart phone", than many people go through and some of their lifetime. That being said I've had all kinds of phones. I started with my iPhone 3G, that phone was like my baby, which is until it fell a measly two feet and shattered. After that I moved onto an HTC. I'm sure you can guess that one broke too. I know have the Samsung Galaxy S3. I believe that this phones is one of the best phones I have ever personally owned and operated, ever. I have found that the software my phone uses is easy to navigate and is pretty much dummy proof Since having this phone I have definitely formed a Samsung product biased opinion. The operating system that runs my phone is easy to use, fun to use, and gives many interesting and cool options for my phone. One of my favorite features on this device currently is the new split screen feature that the phone got with the newest software upgrade. It allows me to use two apps at once. I can be waiting for an important email on one half of my screen and on the other half I can be texting or surfing my twitter feed. Next thing about this feature I enjoy is being able to listen to songs on YouTube while texting people, tweeting, or going on Facebook. I can do any of the two features offered at one time. This comes in handy when I am waiting for an important email or message and still want to be surfing through my social media. Another feature on this phone that comes in handy is that it is compatible to SD cards. This comes in handy in the situation that if my phone ever decides to give out and shut down I can have everything backed up into a SD card to have all my photos and other personal items from my phone stored to something. Many iPhone users will clamed "I have iCloud" or "My photos are backed up into my computer" but there is always that underlying issue of your computer failing you or your iCloud not being one hundred percent. With the SD card compatibility and you can simply upload them anywhere you please with the SD card. Another aspect that that iPhone users tend to argue is "well I have siri" or "my phone is better because it talks to me", well think again, this phone talks to you! Double click your center button and say "Hi Galaxy" and she will wake right up to answer all your questions, desires, wants, and needs. Don't be fooled by the iPhone illusion. There is much better things out there, like the galaxy S3 Next the camera, front and back, are great! The camera, front and back, are high definition and very useful. . The front screen camera comes in handy for apps like Snapchat and Instagram. It also is very helpful in easing the necessity of the infamous selfie. The back camera comes with a super bright flash and it also takes awesome pictures. The phone itself comes with some cool filters installed into the phone and it has a phenomenal zoom! The bright flash also comes in handy very much if you ever get trapped in the woods for some weird reason or if you can't seem to find something in the dark. Another cool thing about this phone is that the battery has a fairly moderate battery life. I find that I can have a full battery in the morning and still have battery left at the end of the day. Also the screen is very large. What is good is that it isn't so large that it is like carrying around an iPad but it's big enough to have with you every day. You can also find some really cute cases for this phone on amazon for cheap. Also for all those people that think this phone is just the new fad for the new generation and there technology, you are wrong! This phone is very user friendly and high speed for a smart phone.  This phone comes with a fantastic internal and external speaker. This comes in handy if you do in fact have impaired hearing or if you just like to hear everything very loudly. Overall I give this phone five stars! It's easy to operate and handy to have. If you're having second thoughts, think no more. The choice is clear buy this phone to keep you busy for the next two years. All you have to do is say, "Hi Galaxy".                    it's a great cell phone, great pictures, i recomen to anyone, its easy to use. you can expand the memory                    Overall I love the phone. Very easy to use. Only downfall is the crappy battery life, it needs to be charged daily.                    Just the right colour size and has all the features I would want in a smart phone I might want to upgrade to an S4 jus for the additional features.                    I certainly would recommend this product for the price. Not bloatware on it ,sleek fast light.Only thing I would say is get a good case , so it doesn't slip                    Very happy with the Samsung S3 both in terms of functionality, phone quality, camera qualitym and its large screen, very happy we purchased it at Amazon for a fair price. Recommended                    I have been using this phone for about 3 weeks not and I love it! It came exactly as described and on time. The phone has a great camera and a great screen.                    i got my Samsung S3 with prime delivery option. it was so fast (next day delivery).on top of that, i'm happy that i have decided to purchase this one.because before the purchase, I spent my time researching on the OS, screen size, the brand, and camera quality.Samsung S3 won my heart. I love it and I have unlimited option with this unlocked phone.I can use it when i'm abroad and in USA. it's perfect for my lifestyle.
!###tiempo de respuesta mejor no puede ser, siempre compro los telefonos en esta tienda los recomiendo 100%, compren aqui con garantia                    Wow!  This is complicated for a person who isn't up to date with technical qualifications.  I love my Galaxy and continue to fumble my way through.  I've been taking lots of pictures it. Handy not to carry a separate camera around. I wonder  how to work the voice command??  The size of the screen is really nice and it's easy to use the keyboard.  I have now set up my weather station for different areas and also have my e-mail coming in.  I did set up with T-Mobile as the phone instructed me.                    Omg I love this phone. I had a HTC hero forever and it sucked so bad . I wish I could have broke it and got replaced with a newer one. But it did Brake once but they gave the same. I wait for this phone for a long time. It was well worth it. The battery life is great . Last me all day. I work at 7 am and its still going until 12 at night. I live all the features it has to offer..the only thing the screen scratched within the fIrst week.  It's my fault for having it my pocket with my keys. I do getting a screen protector immediately after purchase.                    I had a motorola atrix, then an Iphone 4S but the Galaxy S III is the best! the camera is great and incredibly fast, the image is like the iphone 4S but bigger (screen 4,8), the syncronization with google is great and i love the widgets. In comparison with the Iphone I can tell you that you need like 2 or 3 clicks less on every action you want to take. The screen is great but is a little bit bigger so i will prefer a phone not so big. Thanks                    The product is as advertised. I like the way the seller put a small note about how to change the language of the phone from German to English :)The only problem is the Warranty which is really important to me and I expected them to fill out and sign the Warranty card, because without date of purchase and signature of the dealer, the Warranty is not valid (I think so). I couldn't find any way to contact the seller. That's why I finally mentioned the Warranty issue here.Everything else is perfect. The phone seems awesome (for one-day working) and the shipping was fast and on time. I'll update this review after working with the phone for a while.Thanks,Maysam                    More than expected, great telephone, excelent interface, friendly, little expensive but it pay for it. Size is not a problem when you use the internet.                    Im having great.time with this phone but one problem galaxy wont work good with soul by ludacris or any other headphones that good. Other than that it is perfect                    Excelente telefono, procesador super rapido, facil de manejar, gran cantidad de apps dise&ntilde;adas para android entre otras, Lo recomiendo plenamente,Mauricio from Ecuador                    I'm not going to bore you with the many goodies this phone brings about. I'll just say that I'm pretty satisfied with the product, it is everything it's promised. The interface is fast and intuitive, even if you're not familiar with android devices. The only downside is the the finish on the body does look like plastic and not metallic, like it's shown in the pic and the widget for video player is a tad small for my taste. The device is surprisingly light, tho and it's A LOT easier to handle with both hands. I haven't tried  it with any games yet, I have yet to download a couple and see how it works but so far, so good. Recommended!!
!###I am happy that it is working and all, I have already 2 originally from T-Mobile, but needed another for my other line when T-Mobile was by 2 CONTRACT but not anymore but still cheaper. I did get lucky in this one, it works!! Just the BAD THING ABOUT IT is that it was NOT UNLOCKED as it STATED!! That is why I took a STAR OFF...and the other, the BATTERY dies really quickly in use, but fixed that, purchased a new one at a Real Store,T-Mobile =) Other then that I cannot complain about the phone, works great so far...just wish it was UNLOCKED, oh well...I cannot complain. I &#34;KINDA&#34; would recommend this simply because YOU DO NOT GET WHAT THEY SAY YOU WILL...or WORSE, get DUPED and have nothing working.                    in the publication was saying that hera a Samsung Galaxy S GT-I9300 III/S3 and sent me Samsung Galaxy S SGH-747I III/S3 hera not what promised in the publication                    excellent, on time, product the pone Works well, everything ok,im very satisfied with tis purchase, highly recommended for all those who want a high level cell phone                    It is the best cell phone that i have buy. It's realy fast and easy to use the camera it has a goog resolution, the only thing that i find a probem is the battery only has battery for 12 hours                    This phone works great no issues, good battery life and i truly love that i can connect to any network with this unlocked version                    I love my this marvel! Is like having a powerfull machine in your pocket.The best cellphone out there right now (except for the S4), without doubts !                    had the phone for 3 month, for some reason stopped charging even after changing the battery. Contacted the Samsung USA and they would not honor the warranty. I looked at the previous reviews and found 110 previous reviews with the same complaint.                    Samsung Galaxy S III phone is the best I ever had. Easy to use, efficient, very good price. I recommend                    phone work great awesomeI um very pleasetechnologyyou got to love itI Um very please with this piece of equiptment                    I have tried many methods, but unfortunately could not connect and sync with outlook. Besides, everything is very good.Speed / Camera / Construction / Sound / Screen...also good.
!###The S3 is an amazing phone, even considering is more than a year old. I bought this phone as a replacement for other S3 that got lost. Price is going down which is a plus! Definitely I would recoomend this phone to people, it's even better than iPhone 5.                    Awesome phone, bought this for a friend of mine and she loved it. No complaines at all!And the colour was nice                    I bought this cellphone couple of months ago. It is  pretty user- friendly and convenient , but there is some small problems like having issue to insert a language for using in keyboard ( i have to reinsert the second language 2-3 times a week)                    A very good brand new Samsung S3 phone, so cheap, classic, and potable to carry out. I encourage you to go for it.                    Phone arrived on time and in excellent condition. Brand new. The only issue was that the language was set in german so it took a little while to locate the language settings to change it to english. But apart from that excellent worth every dollar. Got it as a gift and the person loves it                    very fast phone . comes with all the cables. the battery is okay too have a good durationBuy it                    was for a grandchildren. birthday present, he is happy.whit hes new toy.hi like it.and i m happy too.thank`sbye bye                    great product, perfect interface, good price, quick navigation, tutorials online, clean appearance. Defenitely recommendable for beginning users of smartphones. Regards                    the phone is the most complete of the SG3, this model is the quadcore and worth paying for, thank you very much for the excellent service!                    The Samsung Galaxy is exactly the device u want to have. It looks elegant and the functionality is exceptional. Get it
!###It is very good phone which i am using it from last two months. Hopefully I hope to see S4 later next year                    product arrived on time, brand new and in excellent condition. My daughter really enjoys this phone, she likes better than Iphone. Thank you.                    Does anybody have any information regarding whether or not the Samsung Galaxy S III/S3 GT-I9300 Factory Unlocked Phone - International Version (Pebble Blue) is compatible with the Verizon 4G LTE network?  or will the network not allow unlocked smart phone use?                    I'm a previous iphone user but I just fell in love with this cel phone. The quality of the graphics is just amazing.The only drawback is that it is a little too big. I'm a girl, so I just put it in my purse and the problem is solved, but for a guy I must admit that it can be tricky to put it in one's pocket. Also, for those living in south america, let me tell you it works perfectly with Claro, although you may need to buy a micro SIM card if you don't already own one.                    I love the performance, and the functionality. Got the phone for four days, played with it everyday and the phone got dropped from above waist level. The screen protector is still applied to the screen so you can't really see an inside crack..the glass is fine but i can see two short lines on the screen. I can no longer use the phone since the lcd is broken. I was telling myself that i have got to get a case for this phone asap before it got dropped since the quality is so cheaply made... unluckily, it got dropped and now i am screwed :(. Good lucky people, protect this phone while you can!                    Always love the iPhone but since I have bought the Samsung galaxy s3 I realize that I love love love it. Great phone with great features and apps for a great price. It's value for money. I recommend it to everyone.                    This phone is amazing.  The screen is crystal-clear, the connections are ultra-fast, and the camera is better than my real camera.  The operating system works smoothly.  The battery life is long.  Best phone/mini-computer ever.                    I liked my iPhone and used it heavily, but was attracted to some of the S3 and Android features. The phone is fantastic. It has a beautiful screen, quick processor, fantastic bells and whistles, and it is easy to use. I plan to buy my wife one when her contract is up. Bravo Samsung. It is nice to see what competition with Apple produced.                    it was t-mobile based but the dealer paid for the unlocking code. the galaxi is great. the screen, the apps, everything.                    Received the phone fast and without trouble. It was in mint condition and booted up perfected. Have now used it for around a month on a daily basis and it has not let me down in any way yet. Would definitely recommend this to others in search of a phone and place to buy. My only grievance was that the charger that came with the phone was with the European socket and that the adapter (nice gesture) that was there did not work. Fortunately my old phone was an Android as well and so the phone could still be charged. But since this was an "extra", it does not change how I feel about the phone.
!###Never again will I try to save a few bucks and switch from my iPhone.  Samsung makes great TVs... they should stick to that.  AVOID this phone.  Too many reasons to list.  Buyer Beware!                    I bought this phone from Wire4less since it had good reviews: Samsung Galaxy S III/S3 GT-I9300 Factory Unlocked Phone - International Version (Pebble Blue)Phone was delivered on time and it is great but is not prepared to resist a simple fall when you fail to put it in your pocket.I got it on Tuesday and 2 days after i dropped it when putting it back in my pocket. A 3 feet fall (tops) was enough to get the plastic that covers the lens of the main camera (rear) completely smashed making the camera useless given the lens sees through a smashed plastic now. I can't believe a U$S 700 phone can take a simple fall so I want to think my unit is faulty and not built properly. I was obviously looking for a case for this phone but couldn't find one in any store so far. I just saw the flip case now in amazon but is too late.I contacted the seller to get an answer on this and they don't want to replace it or refund me given Samsung is not going to cover it. Given it is an international version, Samsung US is not doing a thing and just tell me to contact Amazon customer service or go to a carrier store and ask there.I looked for rear camera replacement online and i could only find it in ebay UK for about U$K 40.If you ask me, this is a great phone, great camera, screen and features but it is just inacceptable to have such a fragile thing. Please take this into account before you decide to buy it and, of course, get a case with it from the very beginning.I HOPE WIRE4LESS, AMAZON OR SAMSUNG DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.                    i have owned a verizon galaxy s3 for about a month now and after having it for only 2-3 weeks I was sitting on the couch with phone in pocket and pulled phone out of pocket and the display was shattered. no pressure placed on screen and didnt drop it . verizon and samsung both say i have to pay to have it fixed. this is ridiculous. I previously owned a droid x with no problems with glass now after only a few weeks I have to deal with a broken display. This is totally unacceptable and this problem needs to be fixed. go ahead and google broken display galaxy s3 and you will find alot. I know its just glass but alot of them that you'll find shouldn't have broke                    The phone function nice. The material the phone made of is VERY CHEAP. The phone fell from a couch hight, the plastic part broke the screen shattered..Samsung needs to build there electronics from a material that is little more expessive..I like the phone technology. AGAIN VERY POOR MATERIAL, AS IF THE PLASTIC BELONGS TO A 99 CENT STORE.                    While I liked the functionality of the phone for the brief time I used it, I find it absurd that if the phone is dropped, with a case on, the screen shatters and that is considered NORMAL and my fault.  The phone fell from table height to the concrete and fell flat.  The entire front cracked.  I was told it was a glass front, was not defective, and I had to buy a new phone.  I have had the phone less that two weeks, and find this response disappointing and unacceptable.  I did not purchase the phone from Amazon, and Sprint is my carrier.  Maybe these things make a difference.                    My screen cracked after 10 days and it was not dropped. Samsung says cracked screens aren't under warranty and there are pages of complaints on google regarding this.My Verizon provider said I would have to file insurance claim with 10 day deductible and I may get a refurbished phone. I told them this is not acceptable. My first Samsung product and my last.Wait for I5 to come out is my recommendation.                    The phone have defective pixel and black spots on a dark background. Then, i contacted a seller (FGS Trading) and they ready to refund the purchase price, but not ready refund taxes and shipment (~300$) and they dont gave any solution to repair the phone. I contacted a Samsung in Israel, and they told me that is no international warranty at most of countries, include Israel. Now i regret that sold Iphone 4 and got this SHIT.                    Unfortunately, my experience with this S3 was the worst possible.I ordered one and shipped it to my parents that were in NY, so they could bring it back to me in Brazil.When arriving, the S3 just didn't work, as the touch screen was not responding to any command.I upgraded the Android OS, but was not helpful.So, the only solution was to return the item to the seller as Samsung Brazil refused to fix the problem here. They told me that the warranty is only valid for the country you buy the product. A joke...As a consequence, i had my money back, but i'm still with no phone. Maybe iPhone 5 or Lumia 9200 will do better than S3 did.                    I just received a new samsung galaxy s3. when I started the camera I realize that there was a ghost of black circle and it never gone even in video mode. I checked the lens and it was crystal clear no scratches or dust. I think I have to go back to Xperia.                    I am very upset with this. This cellphone did not come with a battery or headphones. What is a cellphone without battery, and they haven't solved anything. What am I going to do with a cellphone with no battery?
!###Everybody enjoys upgrading their phone or we wouldn't upgrade, would we?  Of all my phone upgrades, this one is my favorite - from galaxy s2 to Samsung Galaxy S III/S3 GT-I9300 Factory Unlocked Phone - International Version (Pebble Blue).There is a huge improvement in wait time at boot up and that includes comparison with other phones that don't have carrier software/bloatware.  Overall, my expectations have been more than exceeded in the areas of:speedresponsegorgeous screen giving better google navigation experience as well as movies, etc.better size and shapefeels more durable and less like plasticimproved intuitivenessI let google and amazon backups restore/install to my new phone and everything was seamless except for one thing.  Where oh where did the microphone key go on the keyboard?  I love to dictate just about everything!  oh no!  It took me 30 minutes to find the answer.  Hold down the settings key, until you see the microphone key.  Select the microphone key and now the microphone key is where it is supposed to be on the keyboard and one must remember that if you want to change keyboard settings, you must hold down the microphone key until you see the settings icon key to select.This phone requires a micro SIM and I let a friend with a micro SIM cutter cut it rather than following the YouTube videos on how to cut yours with a knife or scissors.  The micro SIM cutter looks like a hold bunch and really makes sure everything goes well.  Amazon sells them as well Noosy [2nd Generation] Micro SIM Cutter, with 2 SIM adapters (Color: Black or Silver) and/or iCoolkit New iPhone Nano SIM Card to Micro /Stander/ full SIM card Tray Adapter Holder which I think is well worth the money if you don't have a friend that already purchased one.I just adore how I can customize and optimize phone to my usage and preferences.With all my other upgrades, I have held the phone and asked myself "is this worth the $$$ to upgrade to this phone?" and after careful consideration I decide yes but just barely.  This upgrade, I immediately whole-heartedlly respond "best $500 I've spent in some time!"woweee!                    It's everything I wanted and more. After 1 month.. am still discovering the features and have no complaints at all. Best Buy EVER!                    It's a good smartphone. I'm lovin. It's fast, beautiful and slim. The iphone is past, the s3 is very better. The seller is very good too. Very fast and professional                    Excellent phone also come on time, better than any other smart phone I had before excellent and exactely as was described on line, very glad.

!###I live in Mexico.  My wireless carrier is Telcel.  The phone is an unlocked international version.  Slip in a Telcel SIM card and I'm good to go.  No problems.  Product is terrific!  I put phone in service June 21.  But - if/when/where service might be needed - well, that's another matter.  I contacted Samsung with detailed info on the phone and where I was located - they shuttled me from South Africa to Hong Kong to USA both phone and websites and no one took responsibility for who do you send the phone to for service if/when needed.  I contacted the seller who - so far - has failed to answer the two simple questions of (1) in what country did they buy the phone (2) when did they buy the phone. This is Samsung's request, not mine.  I contacted Amazon - so far three times.  They are working diligently and so far doing a good job to contact the seller asking them to provide answers to these two questions. I believe Amazon has gone up the organizational chart a notch or two to help resolve this issue.  So far, this is not resolved.  I will update my review when I have more definitive results.  Until I update my review I urge prospective buyers to find out where they should send the phone for service (if/when needed) before purchase.  UPDATE 18 July 2013 - Surge Telecom replied they purchased the product in the USA from Samsung directly.  But the warranty is for Samsung Latin America.  I haven't called Samsung to find out what to do and where in event of warranty issues....that's next.  Please read the content in this link...you will find it useful  http://cellphones.about.com/od/phoneglossary/Cell_Phone_Glossary.htm                    I'm simply happy with it. Good size, steady, has never frozen and battery is still good after 7 months of use.                    I believe that this is a great phone. Good screen, awesome in size and totally customizable. Very happy with it.A review in Amazon isn't good enough for just buying this. I can recommend gsm arena for a much better review and detailed.                    I bought this for my wife and my kid, phone is amazing with international warranty, Sound clarity is good and apps compatibility is also great.                    i bought it for my brother- he loves it!!!very comfortable and easy to use for a phone. almost better than the iphone.... :)                    I Buy this phone for my cousin, its functionality is very good and it really is very fast, the graphics are outstanding, I think I'd buy one for my soon.It is a little big but easy to handle. The phone Samsung S3 I arrive in excellent condition and new exactly as displayed, recommend HassleFreeCell as an excellent seller                    The phone performs just as well as a brand new one.  The battery is even fine.  This is an amazingly smart phone,                    PROVIDES A WIDE SATISFACTION IS A SMART PHONE FIRST. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, ENJOY.EXCELENTE TELEFONO INTELIGENTEBRINDA UNA AMPLIA SATISFACCION, ES UN SMART PHONE DE PRIMERA. ALTAMENTE RECOMENDADO, DISFRUTENLO.                    Firstly love the color pebble blue don't know much about the phone but love my apps that I have downloaded great picture quality and smooth sound quality mi just a gwaan play with it until mi understand it zeen                    everything i ask it to do it does.  does not come with much instructions though. guess everything is on the phone
!###Now this is called a smart phone. It is a smart companion, rather than being just a phone! It can sense when to lock itself, all the motion sensors & smart tasks. Oh. I love this!                    Like: it has an awesome screen, lots of apps, widgets.Dislike: I was an iphone user for a few years and I miss how easy it was to have everything in sync with my mac and ipad. However, there are tons of apps out there that make the trick.This smartphone is great for anyone who is willing to invest a few hours configuring it. Once you do that is perfect.                    Just bought this cellphone. The screen is enlarged. I love the high resolution display. The os provide smooth customer experience.                    I've been (and still am) a Mac person but I everything I heard about Android made me try it. I used a BlackBerry for years and, at times, I miss it. The Galaxy 3 is a great phone, among many other things; too many for me. But I'm learning. The only thing that sometimes annoys me is that it decides to do things spontaneously. Editing and erasing stuff is not obvious, although there is vast amount of support on the web. I'm enjoying it.                    I bought 3 of this Smartphone, for my family.2 of them are excellent one of them stop working after 1 month of use.Thanks to the Amazon costumer service I got my money back, after I sent it back.I rated it only 4 srars becust of this.                    it is simply amazing, great design, lightweight, very thin, ultra fast, longer battery life compared to others, SD slot, NFC, quad core, HD display. The gestures control from samsung gives you a better control and interface over other androids an iOS phones. Those kind of little details give the real meaning of smartphone. It may be expensive, but I worth it.                    I am really loving this phone. The only complaint that I have on this phone, is that you have to have a Samsung printer if you want to print anything from this phone!! I highly recommend this phone!                    &#34;Excellent phone. As described was Factory unlocked & the international version. I'm using it in South American without a problem. After setting up the phone and as soon I put the sim card was making phone calls and receiving emails. &#34;                    Realmente recomendable, hace 2 a&ntilde;os compr&eacute; el Galaxy S (I9000) y me saltee la versi&oacute;n S2, hoy en d&iacute;a tuve la oportunidad de hacer el salto a la versi&oacute;n I9300 y estoy realmente conforme. El env&iacute;o se hizo en tiempo y forma.                    Does everything as advertized.Couple of things for the people that wants an easy-to-use phone. This one has many menus and you need to customize a lot of things to have it the way you want it. If you don't mind expending some time to get this done then pick this phone. Otherwise if you like a a phone that has less things to do and almost ready to use out-of-the-box then you need to look at another option.There is no high quality headphones  with mic and remote control yet that work with this phone. That is a thing to consider if you are seeking for a good music sound. The OEM headphones are OK but not great.The performance is great, a all those widgets that you can get make it something to play a lot with. Just love that.
!###this product is a tool of work and i`m feel very good whit the funtions and aplications. Congratulation to the person that showed for me. this phone is great and has different aplication that are important to the job and compared to other smartphones in my opinion can not say which is better but this works very well. The operation is relative to the need and for my needs this is perfect.                    It's user friendly, great camera.Met my expectations except for battery life and poor Music loading,I Phones are much better in these areas. I have used it for 6months. It's a great toy though.                    Very happy with it. Great size screen. Touch screen works well. Functions work well. Battery life is acceptable. To tell the truth, not sure why someone would go for the SIV.                    Got it on time, it works great according to my brother who i bought it for as a gift , he loves it and prefer it over an iphone .                    the phone is very nice... works perfect in Venezuela with Movistar.great camera, programs, fast and light.one of the best phones right now                    The team works well with movistar Venezuela, positive comments from other users are little at the amazing performance of the equipment, which until now have reviewed.El equipo trabaja bien con movilnet Venezuela, los comentarios positivos de otros usuarios parecen cortos ante la incre&iacute;ble prestaci&oacute;n del equipo, que hasta ahora se han revisado.                    Easy to work, Amazing picture and video quality.Good looks, effective touch screen, all around a great phone.Would recommend to anyone.                    no fault in phone but charger fail it...charger take alot of time to charge....i love the phone but hate the charger...                    this gadget really is a smartphone, samgsun does a excellent job in this phone. And now with the new act of android 4.2.2 this phone becomes again in a competitive phone                    Waiting patiently for Amazon's price on the S4 to become more affordable so I can upgrade. My judgement was made from a comparison with an iPhone 4 which I also own.Mico P. - Trinidad and Tobago
!###Amazing phone, easy to use. The graphics are great.It feel good in the pocket though it seems quite big.The best thing is the camera!                    Needless to say the gift was a success. My husband loved it and I feel happy every time I see him play with it. IT is not my cup of tea but my hubby likes to experiment and such so he will work with it.                    Couldn't be happier with this phone. With the latest 4.1 Android, it runs smoothly and with a lot of features.                    love the phone, it's fast and the screen is very clear.  The size is excellent and not heavy.  Still trying out different things on it.                    Got this thing from Hassle free cell. It arrived on time. Its a class apart piece of engineering. Everything is excellent only the battery life is a problem but thats the case with most of the cellphones. The only problem I had was that I got the instruction guide with the product in French. Apart from that its awesome.                    Nice piece of tech, powerful, nice camera and nice screen but just like some people say it feels kinda plastic but with a nice cover it doesn't really bother me.                    Quad Core is better than Dual Core.... You do the math!!!Pros.Excellent screen, very resistent.Perfect screen sizeFlash supportCustomizableCons.SVoice doesn't works in spanishIs not ergonomic                    A worth for the money, I have already placed an order for the S3 mini for my wife. I love it.                    Strongly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a new, cutting-edge device. Its systems and apps work very well, the device is light (especially considering its size) and resistant, in spite of its frail, cheap appearence. Samsung should definitely have invested a bit more for the casing. The battery life is a plus.
!###Excellent product, I like this phone, only one observation is that the phone is a little slow processor. Thank you                    unbelievable i always hear people talking about smart phones but i never pay attention on it until now i have my Samsung galaxy S3 and believe me a great phone sorry but i just dump my BB torch 9810                    This is probably one of the best purchases that I've made in a long time. This phone is everything that I expected and more. Not only is it internationally unlocked but it has all of the apps available to you as if I bought it in the States. I use it for everything that you can think of to use a phone for. I can't find anything to complain about my Galaxy S3.                    It's a nice device - lots of great features, but it does not print to any printer except Samsung printers.                    The best cel that i have it...very fast downloads.As international versi&oacute;n it recognize all my accounts in seconds.Full recommended!!!!!!I love it!!                    great phone, great camera, lots of apps. Get a good case for it if you give this to a teenager, mine had it for two weeks, dropped it and cracked the screen... A good case is worth the money....                    Hi Guys,i Just bought this phone and i like it a lot.its touch screen performance is very sensitive and good.Besides the OS of Galaxy S3  is upgraded so the apps performance is great and the navigation is so cool as well.the best part i can take a burst of pictures from the camera and select the best one out. its so cool.Thanks All.                    This is my second s3 (the first one fell and broke) and i love this phone.Also with the s4 out this one is cheaper now.                    Best time to buy a good product is when manufacturer releases a new version. Got it at an unbeatable price!
!###yes it is very nice phone. very good working and i loved it very much. this is awesome deal i ever got!                    excelente m&oacute;vil.  muy buena resoluci&oacute;n y fluidez.  la c&aacute;mara es excelente y al actualizar a jelly bean mejora mucho m&aacute;s                    great phone,I got it to my brother and he just loved itthe phone arrived fast and I loved the service                    The best phone ever.  Is just a great phone Easy to use and has everything you need in a smartphone                    Love the screen, size, weight of this phone. I strongly recommend it though i still have to make use of the NFC feature.                    Tris is the best phone in this moment, have all function andas more, i recommended totally i hope continue perfect                    pros:awesome featuresquad corelarge batterycon:worst designcool phone but a bit ovrpriced...but far better than its competitors.                    I love to travel here, there and everywhere. Most of the time I spend my vacations out of the country and one of the problems that travelers often encounter is the kind of phone to use. It is difficult not to be able to contact your friends and families whenever you are traveling, it is also not advisable to always purchase a local mobile phone whenever you are in another country. Thus, I opted to buy the Samsung Galaxy S. This phone can be used no matter where you are on the planet since it has been unlocked by the manufacturer itself.  Although I have found several negative reviews in some aspects about this phone, I still bought it knowing that all I need is to have a phone that will help me in constant communication with my love ones no matter where I am in the planet. What is more interesting is that I bought it for half the original price, a great value for a great cellphone indeed.                    Love the phone. Wasn't too happy that the seal was broken or that the box was left outside my house.
!###Amazing phone is really fast on internet, great screen and amazing color this phone is all that i want. Thanks for the phone                    Super cell. Fast, beautiful, versatile. Excellent price. I love it. I recommend it.This article is the maximum. Amazon is an excellent platform to find what you are looking for good price and quality.                    This phone is exactly what I needed. I travel a lot and the last time I carried a camera, it was stolen from my suitcase. Therefore, I've decided not to buy a camera, but I needed a phone that took good pictures. That's the main reason I bought the Samsung s3, and it takes great pictures. Even georeferenced it your GPS is on.                    The phone i received is French version, the charger is not suitable in the US outlet,so i had to buy another charger and the instruction book is written in French. However the phone is very good. I love the phone.                    The samsung galaxy S3 is a very nice phone, the smartest phone in the world. I am very happy with that. It has a lot of apps to work and to play games also.                    I bought the G3 primarily to use as a GPS on my motorcycle and send the audio to my helmet via bluetooth. It worked great. My only complaint of the G3 is that the home screen does not rotate like all other screens and that it seems to go through the battery quicker than other phones and needs charged at least onece a day. The audio quality during calls is good. The size makes it challenging for one handed operation if you have smaller hands.                    Excellent phone very good, I like their features and is the world's telephone etter thanks for sale, good, good, good                    Product exactly as described. I love using it. It was money well spent! I can't get enough of it and I would recommend it to everyone!                    A great smart phone! It does every thing what was expeted. I my oppinion no need spent extra money for a S4 model.
!###Una obra de arte, lo amaran. El iphone es juguete al lado de esta maquina.A masterpiece, you will love it. The iphone is a toy beside this machine.                    The best phone I ever have....  Ive been an Iphone fan since it came out....  NOT ANYMORE!!  this is much better...!!!  many more posibilities, programs, adds on...  gadgets.....  everything.....                    I love the phone it is very usefulVery modern phone, It is controlling the marketI already recommended to my friends                    My five stars is because this product really was beyond my expectations.Positives: pretty design, great screen quality, apps very functional.Negatives: I couldn't find yet.People complain about the size, but you know that you are buying it. At least I can read well some files.                    amazing item ad and excellent gift to give to any body and looks very fine article to buy any time, and excellent gadget                    Battery life is the only thing that deserves improvement. Overall, it is na amazing device and I am very satisfied.                    I have the Sprint version of this phone. Super nice large screen, can take up to 64MB of Class 6 memory! I talked to a Samsung factory expert, and he said they just started shipping the 64MB class 6 card for this Qualcomm processor phone.It has a problem with class 10 camera memory, the board is not supporting it, so if you want to not have to format your card because it crashed, like it did twice in a week on my phone, keep with Class 4 (*Which the Sprint stores sell, not 6 or 10) or the faster Class 6 memory. I bought it right here $15 on Amazon Samsung MB-MSAGA/US 16 GB Class 6 microSDHC Flash Memory Card get it today.                    una mounstruo de equipo nuevo desbloqueado recomendado es mas que un telefono sirve para todo lo mejor que he visto                    I LOVE IT! I am not a big fan of apple because of the way they lock their software and in all honestly I hate iTunes...I got used to Android and absolutely loved this phone! Great functionality, awesome screen and it just does a lot.I recently changed it for an iPhone 5 because I got the iPhone from work, but I do miss my Galaxy 3. Siri is better on the iPhone, I'll give apple that, but on the rest, I'll stick to the Galaxy, for sure!
!###the phone itself is def wht i was looking for. a lil over priced but its not bad at all.                    Surprisingly fast shipment, phone worked flawlessly, all the accessories where there and worked as they should. I had to return it not because there was anything wrong with the phone, I wasn't aware that International versions of phones doesn't really work well with US carriers because the bandwidth they use is different as the rest of the world. I contacted them and explained why I had to return it and in 5-10 mins they approved me to return it. Even issuing the refund was pretty fast and without any issue. I wouldn't hesitate if I had to buy from this company again, really professional and responsible.                    I think that this is a great product, works great, all the apps runs quickly, the camera take great pictures.                    There's a reason why the Galaxy SIII is one of the best phones in the world. I love mine! Having loads of storage helps for piling on the useful apps. I couldn't be happier with my purchase!                    I've used samsung befoer and couldn't wait to give the s3 a run for it's money. Found out it was m9re than what I bargain for. I am living it.                    I'm really statified this phone but battery is  not good. But very good for me to used and this phone is unlocked phone but i did                    It worked perfectly even though I bought it in the States and I'm using it in Argentina...great phone I like it a lot                    Great phone at a good price and it was really unlocked. I will soon by one more for my family.                    I purchased this phone to use internationally in Korea... it's a dream.  Only thing (and this has nothing to do with the phone) I couldn't BELIEVE it was cheaper for me to buy a Samsung phone on Amazon and have it shipped here when Samsung is a Korean company.  Plain-o bonkers...Get this phone... you'll be happy.                    Samsung love it, keep making awesome phones!!  Proud that this is a Korean product, forget the iphone!!  this is way worth the $!
!###dear all,I bought this cell phone but i got shocked when i opened the box , the battery doesn't fit in phone , then i decided to buy another battery , another big shock is , i did not find any battery at battery shops , the seller said you must request it from amazon , i bought 3 battery for same model GT-19300 , but also doesn't fit , now i have owned this fake phone for 3 weeks , what should i do , can i return it back and i get my money back ?                    I can,t start the phone it's without software it is not gt-i9300 it is a korean version and now i have 1 week in America and i can't send you back the phone sooo im not happy                    TGU Enterprise sold me a fake phone. a clone. the Galaxy SIII Battery did not even fit, and neither did the case.                    Mobile Phone Battery Charger does not work.the phone was not made in korea or usa. it was made in china.it does not match with the seller's description                    The product I got is not what the seller publicizes. The ad claims the product is brand new but my phone has been modified. It is impossible to bring it back to the original setting. The android version is 4.1.1 which is old and doesn`t allow updatings. Two more identically advertised phones were bought by my brother on the same day from a different seller and the phones coincide with the ad. I feel I've been cheated. Amazon offered to change the phone but I still need to solve how to take it back to the States. I'm happy with how Amazon is dealing with the situation but awfully disappointed with the seller.                    I researched the phone a lot before buying.  I went on a formum called Howards forum and talked to several people there.  Then I talked to the seller of this phone who gave me helpful info on which phone to get.  I was  worried about buying the international over the US version.  Seller said it was better and so did the forums.  I have service through a small provider.  I have always had a Blackberry and had upgraded as soon as the new one came out.  We got my mother a Samsung because she wanted a smartphone and I loved what she had.  Galaxy 2.  Anyway I got my phone 2 days after order was placed.  I am not sure why anyone would have problems with the phone being in German.  It gives instructions on how to set the phone before you can open the box.  Box is sealed with the instructions.  Phone is very fast, pictures are beautiful.  Camera has none of the lag of other camera phones I have owned have.  I practiced on the grand kids today and got very good action shots.  Everything is set up to send the photos anywhere you want.  I will be getting an Otterbox cover as I really don't want to damage that beautiful screen.. I seem to be running the battery down fast but I have downloaded lots of apps and pictures so I hope thats it.  So far it seems to last one day between charges.  But as I say I have been using pretty heavy. So far I would buy this phone again.                    Overall, The Galaxy S III is the best phone I have ever owned. It is perfect for any college student. It is easy to use and its internal memory is excellent. It takes amazing photos with the rear camera, the front camera is also very good, and the camera setting are very easy to use and offer a variety of effects. The update for the phone now has a driving mode setting which reads you who is calling or texting you. The personalization features are very good as well. The only drawbacks of this phone are the battery life and durability. I usually run out of battery by noon everyday. I recommend buying a backup battery and charging station if you use your phone heavily. This phone is very fragile too. Even though the screen is nearly scratch proof, a short drop on the pavement or floor will crack the screen. The otterbox defender case is a sure way to ensure the safety of the phone. They are a little pricy but make the phone waterproof and shock absorbent. Occasionally there is a lag in the phone. This phone is an excellent buy overall and can meet the needs of any person.                    Hi i just want to mention that this international version supports only Edge not 3g or 4g with T mobile connection. i didnt try with other carrier. Please be aware, i am not sure if there is any other way to make it work on 3G                    After using Blackberry for over 5 years, I made the decision to try the Android line of phones.  After doing some research on both the Motorola Droid Max and the Samsung Galaxy S3; I settled on the Samsung.  The phone lives up to all the specifications only negative is its battery live.  I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a serious android phone.                    Went from iPhone 4s to Galaxy S3.  Getting used to it and using Doubletwist for iTunes music.  Just tired of the whole Apple monopoly and arrogance.  Phone worked great out of the box with extra directions from shipper.  Using Straight Talk with no difficulty in getting that setup.
!###I love this phone.After 6 months of ownership, I got in love with this phone.It's always fast and responsive.The display is amazing, really good colors, brightness and resolution.Both back and front cameras are amazing. It takes really good pictures, and panoramic pictures are amazing.Android OS gets updated frequently (not as frequently as for google phones). Im actually at Android 4.1.1 and it's full of features                    This phone works well when it is in a good network or WI-FI location. Cell coverage here is bad, though. The battery drains extremely quickly. I would rate it lower because of the battery but I just found out an extended battery is available. Most similar devices don't have the option.                    It was everything it said it was going to be and more, it's incredibly awesome and beautiful. Best cell phone i have ever purchased, would recommend this to my friends anytime!!!!!                    This phone is awesome, and works perfectly!!! I really love Samsung, they made incredible stuff and of a very high quality.                    This is the best phone nowadays... I just love it... it is a fantastic electronic device... wonderful item... thank you                    The phone is good so far, my only problem is the sim slot is too small. Currently I'm using it to surf the net through wi-fi. It's a cool phone                    this is the best cell phone I have ever seen. it works so fast.i think it is better iphone. love samsung&#65281;                    Funciona perfecto, cunple con todas las especificaciones, se actualiz&oacute; a JB enseguida sin problemas. Y funciona perfecto con prestadores de Argentina. No me arrepiento para nada y lo volver&iacute;a a elegir!                    Just perfect...Thanks, it was just like it said in the offer. Very professional and fast.Best regards.Germ&aacute;n Sims S&egrave;ve.
!###i recomended. this phone is too fast and have a clean software. android jajaj is the best. the games is so good                    I wasn't aware of the difficulties in getting an international phone troubleshot or fixed. Its an internal slight difference or you wouldn't know there is one. I shouldn't have to send my phone across the country when there's an issue and Samsung should resolve that for their customers. Otherwise........love it!                    I have been using Samsung Galaxy SIII for more than 6 months now. There were some teething troubles in moving from iOS to Andriod. But over all Galaxy SIII is the best phone from android stable.- Fast- Gorgeous bright screen- Excellent camera with options for burst shoot, best photo etc- Customize this phone to your heart's content.- Battery life is good with aggressive battery management- I had better experience with S Voice than Siri but it is not as useful as the apple offeringand the other side of the story- Samsung should revamp their stock apps especially the email app. They simply don't measure up to iOS standards. But there are other apps available on android store.- Some of the stuff marketed by Samsung like Smart Stay etc. are not practical to use and not reliable enough- Overall less intuitive for an user coming from apple eco system after 5 years.                    Fantastic cell phone, it arrived in very good conditions w/o any problem and it is working fantastic my wife love it.                    Super fast phone, you can do almost whatever you want. Customizable and intuitive. I strongly recommended if you are an android fan                    The price was decent, the product was as described. Great phone I used it while traveling in Europe and back home in the states.                    This product attend me perfectly!Beautiful design, soft and sensitive touch.I am satisfected with this product I have bought.                    &#34;Not comment on the description that came with the 220v charger and now I have to invest for a 110v charger.&#34; for Sold by: Techno.Trading.House.  I don know why came the 220v charger, here American use 110v.
!###This phone is great! Lots of features and Apps. It came on time, unlocked and ready to use here in Mexico. I took the Sim card from my iPhone 4s and inserted it along with a 64 GB SD card and turned on the phone and it has worked flawlessly on the Telcel network.Amazon did a great job.The only phone for me!                    I love this phone. Bit of a learning curve with all the features on the phone. I honestly haven't found anything to be disappointed with yet.                    My olnly compliant is about the battery, it doesn't last long, the phone works very good and is impressive at all.                    Working well and enjoying the phone every time I use it.Brilliant touch and look. Recommended if you are looking for high end smart phone.                    This is from the perspective of a seven year old. This  smartphone is much like an iphone. Its very useful but, I think it should be smaller. Its great. I like to play games on it although gaming is prettier on the apple counterpart.                    I had a blackberry 9790, and i bought two week ago this Samsung, it's amazing, I think it has a big screen, works very well, my battery works excelente, it's Amazing Smartphone, it interface its lighter for use.                    my new toy for christmas!!!!i found this device in amazon market place and i loved it at first.and price was awesome!! i expect enjoy it for long time                    The good is not working properly, as an example, when I tap de screen as to open an item for my mail, picture, file, etc. it doesn't work, I have to tap several times or back in the screen then return to the item to open it.I am considering returning the product based on warranties.                    The best mobile in market now. It is very light for its dimensions. The camera is good. The music quality is also good.                    Well, almost. Just for the charger. It comes with a weird German (?) wall plug. Since the plug is changeable, just hoped to be warned and have the option to buy the correct one, instead of that huge adapter.Besides that, great product and arrived as expected.
!###Super phone.  Very slick looking, fast and user friendly.  Nice colour.  The only problem is the international version will arrive set in a different language...this video shows you how to change to English or another preferred language[...]Otherwise perfect!                    Amazing phone I have it over an year already and it still works perfectly. Works fast has a lot of memory and a good photo resolution.                    Great product, light, beautiful, and a Very powerfull machine! It's a Very good deal, due the price and quality. I recomend.                    What can I say phone is awesome features to the heavens love it a must have best phone I ever had...                    Nice device, I have nexus one and it is very similar. We will see if this model is better or not                    I absolutly love this phone, i probably will never go back to an iphone again. Every angle about this phone is better to me other than the sexy look of the iphone with its glass and metal like finish                    I used this phone with my straight talk plan and it works perfectly I was able to link my Facebook to it as we'll as my google contacts with no problem                    Muy contenta con el envio a tiempo y el producto llego en muy buen estado y a tiempo. El telefono cumple con mis espectativas.                    I like it very much.  Hope the model stands with all accessories for a long time in shelf. I wish it was cheaper so I can buy another one in red.
!###Just love it. Still going through the process of learning how to appreciate all the features it has come with. One complain I have. The Quick Guide booklet suggested to go on the Samsung website and download the user manual. I tred that several times and have not been able to do so. The site directs you to everything else including washing machines, vehicles etc. and no manual. That I found to be very disappointing, as I was hoping to obtain as much info as possible relating to the use of the phone.                    The phone was delivered within the required time and in perfect condition. Living in Europe, it was important for it to be unlocked and I have had absolutely no issues using it. Getting to grips with the phone is super easy - very instinctive.Love it!                    I will preface this review by noting that I owned a Nexus One (loved it) then a Thunderbolt (wasn't as fond of it). I am biased toward Android phones. Actually, I briefly thought about getting an iPhone solely because of the number of options you have as far as software, accessories, etc. However, I have always HATED the small screen of an iPhone. When I heard the 5 was going to have a larger screen, I was interested. When I saw what they actually did with the 5's screen, I was sorely disappointed, and knew I was sticking with Android. I used to love HTC as my last 3 phones were from them (starting with HTC touch). I felt like they lost their touch, no pun intended.So I went to this phone. I believe it is better to purchase a "mainstream" phone as more popular devices receive better ongoing support. Coming from the Thunderbolt, I was never even going to see an ICS update, let alone Jelly Bean. Anyways, to keep it short and simple, this feels like a real phone to me. It is zippy (especially with the JB update), has a large, beautiful screen that is easy to read, has 4g, and has a pretty decent camera to me (although I am no authority on cameras). The only downside is battery life isn't what I expected. It's definitely an improvement to what I had on the Thunderbolt, but this is where they need to continue to focus on improving. All in all, I don't know how you can not like this phone? The only bad I have ever heard about this phone is that it is not an iPhone.                    Amazed!This is a great phone/tablet/computer/etc, etc, etc!! I just loved it!The phone itself just like many other gadgets, need some improvements, the screen may be hard to see during the daylight and if you let it to get adjusted automatically the battery will go down faster. But after all it is a great device!!                    Excelente Produto !!! Recomendo.Qualidade, custo benef&iacute;cio, pode comprar...Entrega no prazo acordado, embalagem perfeita...indico o vendedor atencioso cumpre o que promete                    We bought S3 phones a week ago and I feel like my life is changed! I had Android before but the large screen is so much more efficient. Basically I wanted a mini tablet and that's what I got. It's fast, battery life efficient, very sharp image and lightweight.I bought the blue color and my fianc&eacute; got the white. We thought the pebble blue looks more purple so I got that color and love it! It looks better than the white but it's more feminine color so I wouldn't suggest it for a guy. Pebble Blue is more of a brush metal look in a periwinkle color. Best phone I've ever had and it was great to spend the last week on vacation learning how to use/set-up this awesome phone!                    No complains about it, it delivered and works perfectly without any flaws, just as advertised. Highly recommend, and you should get this phone                    This phone is a master piece compare to all the phone I used. It is user's friendly and easy to use. I am proud to recommend this phone to anyone - It is perfect in every ways.

!###Product was in perfect condition! Arrived as it said even thought it was around Christmas time. The phone is very user friendly, quick, and takes great pictures. Lots of interesting features.                    I'm completely in love with my cute Samsung Galaxy S III/S3 GT-I9300 Factory Unlocked Phone. It's awesome!!! Very light and incredibly beautiful! It's working perfectly in Brazil!                    very good product is fast, betifull, and utility is very fun and practic, i recomended this product, good product, exelent resulution                    Buen telefono, buen procesador. calidad de graficos.

I love it, it's easy to use (Not as intuitive as the iphone), better resolution, better camera, great performance, just awesome! I love it and would not like to change it anytime soon!!                    Good  phone.  Just noticed slight change on swipe prediction since looks to me my gs2 was little bit more accurate in some instances,  although I cannot fully verify this.Better to get this one than att version,  even losing lte.                    Nice, excellent product, i'm very happy whit this shop, Nice, excellent product, i'm very happy whit this shop, Nice, excellent product, i'm very happy whit this shop                    Muy buena, hice buena compra. No me arrepiento de la compra hecha. Bajar los precios un poco m&aacute;s por favor s&iacute;?                    Its hardware specs are over kill. Quad core processor! and yes, everything moves smoothly and quickly on this phone. There may have a few delays here and there, but that's expected.This phone requires both hands, although you can use it a bit with one hand.                    This phone is excellent for android lovers, with a big beautiful screen (yes, it's pen tile, but in my daily use it has never bothered me). The quad-core processor is fast and responsive, and the micro-sd card expansion is a welcome addition, in these times when sd card slots seem to be on the verge of extinction. The Jelly Bean update is available, making it even better.
!###EL PRODUCTO ME LLEG&Oacute; EN EL TIEMPO ESTABLECIDO EN LA COMPRA, TODO BIEN Y EN PERFECTO ESTADO POR LO TANTO RECOMIENDO AL VENDEDOR COMO SERIO Y RESPONSABLE                    perfecto excelente hasta la fecha sin problemas gracias de nuevo un placer hacer negocio con ustedes muy agradesido gracias por todo                    This is the best phone that has come to the world market to date.I think this is more than iPhone in many ways.My brother has a Iphone 4s and was watching everything the mine offers and decided to sell the iPhone to buy a Galaxy S3.At first I thought it was overkill when critics called it &#34;the iPhone killer&#34; but I think they are right.                    This phone was delivered on time by the supplier, so I could use it overseas. Once I was overseas, the phone was easy to set up as it came already unlocked. I used it all the time and always performed as advertised, no problems whatsoever. I will highly recommend this phone, which I think it is better than the I-Phone.                    excelente el producto lo recomiendo, llego en buenas condiciones. el empaque es muy bueno, no estaba abierto y a tiempo!!                    Excelente equipo y excelente los servicios del vendedor al entregar a tiempo y en optimas condiciones el producto requerido por mi..                    This phone is SO cool! Plus its unlocked so it will work on any network! But the only problem I have is that I cant silence the camera noise since in other countries besides 'Murica its illegal or something to have a silent cell camera. Privacy rights or something. Youll have to get root access to silence the camera. Event third party camera apps wont work to silence it.                    excellent treatment and responsible negotiation, are recommended to buy, thanks for the sale, I hope soon to have to buy back their products                    Samsung Galaxy S III/S3 GT-I9300 Factory Unlocked Phone...THE BEST.  killer smartphone.  excellent product.arrived ok as expected. product and timing ok. ok . . . . . .                    It's amazing smart phone, i would recommended to buy to anyone, is better than the other. A little big screen but it's Ok
!###Fast, slim, light, beautiful, easy to use. This device is great! It took me several months to decide wich phone to buy. After so much comparison and investigation I definitly  got the best.                    This is a very fast phone, a tthink this is its most relevant fature... the size is not what like the most, a mean, it isn't discret at all.. but am happy wiht it. if you don't matter about a phone size i'll plany recomend this one for you..                    This is my second galaxy 3, i liked it so much that I bought this cellular one extra for the birthday of my dad, he is not familiar with new technologies but is very happy with this phone.                    i love this phone the only thing that i hate its that i didnt know about the differences on RAM between the international version and companies version                    This cell phone works perfectly and is unlocked and international version, in perfect conditions and do not have problem in this package                    This is my first android phone, so I wanted to have a quality phone, I have to say that so far I am very happy with my purchase. I'm not really a "gadget and widget" kind of person so a lot of the technical specs are lost on me, but the ease of use and simplicity of the phone has won me over!. My only criticisms is that the absolute basics are not made obvious, eg: I could not find any info on how to answer the phone , I looked online and on youtube and looked through the basic manuals that came with the phone, I felt quite silly to not know how to do such a basic thing. fortunatey my nephew came to the rescue, and of course once you know ...it's so simple.I am a person who is vision impaired so being able to change the text size is convenient and helpful, I tried the speaking feature that comes for people with vision issues, but I found it to be too intrusive, even obnoxious, and was the cause of our first and only fight(Sammy and me-Sammy is my phones name, obviously!)Oh yeah...You can give your phone a name, and wake it up with a "good morning"...ah the magic!!Overall, I can only say again that I am very happy with my phone and would reccomend it to anyone looking for a new experience, even my 80yr old mother has used it and she is a "technophobe".                    This phone is great, but i have a complain... i live in south america where this pone works excellent. But i usually go to USA for bussines and this phone is banned on Tmobile so i cant use with my line. Very dissapointed with that.                    From the moment you first turned on, it is easy to use, with advanced technology, just as good as the competition. You will be in another dimension.Must take into account the first time you turn on the phone to set the language correctly.This phone goes beyond what I expectedRecommended 200%                    Esta super lindo, muy practico y me encanta... No me ha dado problemas en lo absoluto y se los recomiendo!!!
!###I became the product in time. It is a great cellphone and it works very fast, the only problem is the battery.                    I am not objective about technology because I used an old cellphone but I can say that is was unlocked and it is functioning good in Colombia with 3G.                    excellent phone, a little big but it fits the reality of modern-day phones. the best competition in the market and one of the best brands                    I absolutely love this phone. Its everything that I wanted. it works great. I haven't gotten it on a plan as yet but I can use the Internet features to do other things while I find a company that it will work with.                    Got here on time, works very nice, fully in English and all the S3 features we like to see work just fine.                    He was in doubt about which phone to buy. My choice was between the IPhone and the Galaxy SIII. I am fully satisfied with the product, it exceeded my expectations. Excellent device, offered me much more than I expected.                    and excelent item sure meets the expected will sure buy another . . . . . . . . .                    Because i'm satisfacted with the phone it's usefull for me, and it is beatiful and funny. the shippment was on time.                    It works perfectly the only thing I did not like is that the phone comes in french. But overall it is great.                    I got it as a present for my husband and he loves it! It's a lot more than a phone, it's better than a lap top.
!###I got this phone (not from Amazon but directly from Verizon) and I just thought it would be fair to warn people that its a glorified iPhone.  I have had it a month and I got it as my eligible upgrade became aviable.Pros:1  Camera is awesome.Cons.1  If you are used to a keyboard the texting sucks.  The autocorrect must be in a different language because it changes words to ones I have never heard of before.2  Cannot send video files of any size unless you reformat them (and they look horrible)3  The worst thing about the phone is the Verizon 4G service.  Sure, 4G is good when it works, but when it doesn't (which is still more than half the country), you wont be able to use the internet or send email.  Verizon told me "this will change as 4G technology develops."  WTF??!Everything special about this phone (except the camera) my Droid 2 had.  And that phone actually worked better.                    I bought this item for my mother who is now in late 50s. She wanted a smartphone so I got her something that had a good review with reasonable price and big screen size for her bad sight. As I was using it, it was very complicated since access to the setting was not so friendly. For Android, you do not have access to most of the applications through device's setting, but you have to go to its own setting to control it. Also, for this device, you have to touch-and-drag to open the phone. To parents like mine have little knowledge or sense for that. It took her 3 days to figure out. Now she thinks you have to touch-and-drag all the applications to open it. She will take a long time to get used to this phone.Maybe this phone is for more young, new generation who know how to use touch screen properly. Do not recommend it for parents if you are merely getting it for the size of its screen. Yes, for me, i think it's pretty decent device to use where you can do so many things.                    This is not a smart phone is the smart phone. I am sure that this review will only add to the countless positive review this phone already had.                    Great phone, but isn't compatible with my mobile cell phone provider, Verizon. I Hate returning s***! Please include these details in description.                    My Samsung Galaxy S3 got rebooted and stuck on the boot screen "Samsung galaxy S III GT-I9300". Bought only on June 6, 2012. Just used two months.Gave it to the service center and they told my whole data on the phone will be lost. I don't have any backup also. Didn't expect this to become faulty so soon.The problem was with phone's board and I got it fixed by replacing the board after 2 daysI used iphone4s and blackberry previously but never had any issue. First time on android and Samsung Galaxy and gave me very bad experience.Shame on Samsung for poor build quality!! I will think twice to buy another Galaxy smartphone.                    This phone is a disappointment. Despite the hype about Gorilla Glass 2.0, the display is the easily most fragile I have ever seen on a cell phone (this by itself justifies one star). The battery lasts barely 10 hours under light use. S-voice is essentially useless - it takes three times as long to get it to do anything useful than does Google Voice Search. Samsung support is poor and unresponsive.                    very surprised by the poor service from this seller and Amazon, we buy this cellphone and a month of using the phone stopped charging, I wrote to the supplier and Amazon to apply the guarantee but referred me to contact Samsung, Samsung told me they apply the warranty only to phones purchased in her page directly. It was very disappoinedbecause anyone fix me the problem and I paid for a very expensive phone.                    I had a very bad experience with trying two different Samsung Galaxy S3 phones.  Each phone worked very well for the first 24 hours or so.However, thereafter the phone froze on me.  Despite multiple attempts to reboot the phone by turning the phone off (if I could) or taking the battery out, the phone would either not even reboot correctly or soon after it did, would freeze.Since it happened on two consecutive models, the retailer that I purchased it from, thought there may have been a problem with the apps that I tried to place on the phone.  I had the same set of apps on my Samsung Fascinate which I have been fairly pleased with until I started to run into a marked reduction in battery life about 2-3 months ago.I wasted about 8 hours of my time trying to make this phone work for me.  It was a very frustrating experience.  I will probably now buy an iPhone despite the fact that the Samsung Galaxy S3 would have been my third generation of Samsung smartphone.I continue to read the positive reviews of others, but I did not have a good experience with this phone.                    The screen is not bright enough in a sunny day. Cannot see anything even at full brightness.Too big for my pocket, it almost bends when i sit.Battery life is horrible.If i get sweat touch wont work. After a full dry I have to restart phone.Phone gets too hot while talkibg or charging or playing anything.                    Working in technology gave me the opportunity to use this first hand along with the Apple iPhone 5.  Hands down the iPhone's workmanship blows this shoddy device out of the water.  After using it extensively for 2 weeks the S3 started making a creaking noise if squeezed too tightly...If this phone was half the price of an iPhone I would say it might be a good candidate however since they are almost the same cost, the S3 is too cheap looking for the price you pay.  Not to mention the constant crashing and low battery life as reported by several users.
!###ok people responsible arrive on time and in perfectc ondition  the product works great and my wife is very happy                    This phone is being very useful for me.  Nice apps, easy to use, expandable memory with micro SD, switchable battery.                    Excellent Product. Excellent Quality. Perfect for every day and easy to use. Do not failed. It was just what i wanted.                    El telefono tiene una excelente pantalla y es muy rapido por eso le doy 5 estrellas , es un telefono , muy ligero y bonito                    I have nothing to complain about this phone. I am very satisfied. It is better than i was expecting. Great phone...                    It is great and my only concern is the battery consumption: if you get addicted to using it, you'll drain the batteries too soon                    Perfect couldn't ask for better. The service was excellent and the product is more than I expected. Glad I purchased it.                    I bought this phone as an upgrade from my Samsung Galaxy Note phone. I had it since July 2012 and a few months ago I started to see on my top right hand corner of teh screen a purple hue. I havent dropped the phone. It's been expanding slowly to the rest of the screen. The screen works and I am able to use my phone but I wished there was better quality. Samsung phones are great, would change them but I feel thet could be made with better quality materials. I would recomend the phone but be careful with it, its extremely delicate.
!###great phone and computing systemi like it and definitely will use it for my primary phone and recommend it to relatives                    awesome,also they bring very quickly and in good conditions .maybe you can buy an accesory fron here . h                    It is all in the description, and I bought it knowing that this version is non LTE and, despite it is Quad core, it is slower than US versions due to only 1 GB of RAM comprared with 2 in the US version. My wofe has the HTC one X and, apart from the screen, it is much better, faster and stable phone than the S3 i9300.                    I really love it. I think this is the best smart phone in the market right now. It has already updated to Jeally Bean.                    That's a very good phone. Unfortunately I didn't got an answer on some of my questions, before I bought it.                    The phone is amazing easy to use, great unique features that makes it the best smart phone so far, really fast the voice command works fine to change songs, stop or repeat alarms. The cam really stands up many features and really fast.                    Excelente celular, llego en el tiempo estimado, sin problema ninguno, tiene buen funcionamiento, vendedor muy bueno y responsable...... recomendado 100%                    Loving it. The battery life is acceptable (1-2 days with moderate use). The cover easily get scratched and the camera flashlight is very slow. Aside from those minor issues, it's a perfect phone.                    I just dont like the fact that it had German configuration, European electric adaptor and I bought it in USA                    I like this phone so much that i bought another and sent it to my father overseas.... I like the quality of camera in it and the size of screen.
!###I really liked the product they have very good price, plus excellent quality. His delivery was on time was estimated. I recommend it!                    The item came as described within the range of days it was supposed to come and it was well packed.                    I researched before I bought. I have nothing negative other than I keep playing with it like a new toy received at Christmas, and Christmas is long gone.I am coming from a bb, so there is more screen, more power, more apps, and just a lot more fun. I dont know all that it can do yet but I love finding out new things on a daily basis.                    I love this phone &#60;3Excelente tel&eacute;fono, lleg&oacute; a mis manos en Venezuela, en perfecto estado y todo en orden. Me encanta la pantalla t&aacute;ctil del equipo, la c&aacute;mara es lo m&aacute;ximo, y todas sus funciones son excepcionales.                    I am very happy with this phone, it works wonderful! The color is nice and the technology Nr. 1! A very good purchase!                    I got this phone about a month ago, but this was better than I expected. It feels awesome in my hand and heaps better than iphones since it has a large screen big enough watch anything. I would rate this five stars but unfortunately it has poor battery life but the extended version is better. The battery uses up its life even if you don't use it. But this is such a great with many abilities its such a great phone                    I am loving every day of having this phone. Beautiful, stylish and extremely useful!! Highly recommend to every one .                    I have 2 galaxy S3 - one for myself and one for my wife. Her phone is working perfectly - mine is not. I bought both phones in September and they both upgraded successfully to jelly bean. My phone for the last 2 weeks will not connect to the internet via WiFi - I get an authentication error followed by saved but no connection. A reset and then one with tech support ( t mobile ) and the phone is still dead. If you search the internet, you will see this error was reported in May 2012 which means 7 to 8 months and there is no fix!!! Tell me Samsung doesn't know this and I will sell you the Brooklyn Bridge. I have never liked Samsung and its products and this goes further to confirm that. I bought the phones because they were the latest and greatest - my mistake. When working my phone is blazingly fast. It is twitchy and if you hold it wrong, it will change menus but I find it disgusting that in 7+ months no fix has been found. T mobile will send a replacement phone but that is poor consolation                    I have to mention that there is an error in the product description of this product. The International version of the Galaxy S3 (GT-I9100) does NOT come with Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Dual Core 1.5 GHz processor. This specification is true for the American variants of the GS3. The International one comes with quad-core Samsung Exynos 4412 1.4 GHz processor. You need to correct this.                    I have had a S III before and i know that with all cellphones, once you get it you must let the battery run down completely before charging it. I did that and once it was fully charged, i unplugged it. 5 hours later the battery is at 10 % and the pop up messgae is on the screen asking for the charger to be plugged in.I will take a closer look at the battery life again and re submit my findings
!###DO NOT BUY ANY SAMSUNG PRODUCTS.Their customer service is one of the worst in the US.They do not stand behind their products and when you ask to speak with a supervisor, they casually offer to put you on the wait list for someone to get back to you within a few days.I was planning on buying a whole range of Samsung products, but my last experience with them alerted me to look to their more accommodating competition.FredSamsung : RFG237AARS 23 cu. ft.

Muy rapido y exelente hardware y android lo mejor por supuesto. Samsung rompe record el mejor celular.                    S3 is a very advanced mobile phone. i bought from wire4less, the only thing im not quite satisfied is there is the boe wasnt sealed, which makes me think it might a second hand or returned item.                    I loved this phone initially, but within 3 weeks the phone stopped working.  Now it won't turn on or charge.  I have to send back to Hong Kong for repair.  Be careful of unlocked phones.                    My Advice is DON"T get the Samsung Galaxy phone.  I made a mistake of buying a Galaxy S3 phone a few months ago and I regret that decision ever since.Here are SOME of the problems I've been having with this phone:1) the battery has a very short life. If I don't use the phone by the afternoon it is low battery and by the evening it is dead. And it takes a LONG time to charge the battery. It is a very slow process.  And have to charge the battery all night long and any time I get a chance during the day.2) The screen is nearly impossible to see when out side in daylight. I have set the brightness to the maximum, and have disabled all auto adjust, it is still very dark gray background in the day light and I Just can't see the screen. It is very frustrating.3) The silent mode, it is very hard to set, but it sometimes goes on silent or comes out of silent mode by itself.4) Almost ALL the apps on this phone don't work.. for example the phone app gets stuck sometimes and does not receive any new mail, but it does not gives you any indication that something is wrong.  It may be hours or days before you know something is wrong. And the solution (according to the at&t representative) is to remove the mail software and reinstall it.4) Most of the GPS apps don't work properly. I use an app when I go hiking that keeps track I where I have been and how far I have walked, but most often it takes 45 minutes to get the GPS signal, By them I'm I my way back and it is of very little use to me.5) the on/off button and the sound +/- are set in opposite side of the phone and in front of each other , as a result when I want to turn the unit off it also changes the sound. So the sound may go down to silent without noticing it.6) The ear piece has a rubbery piece around it that makes it sounds like you are hearing things under water. I finally got fed-up and took the rubbery piece off, bow it just scratchy and uncomfortable.7) Every once in a while the internet app, comes up with an ADD page that I have not found any way to get rid of it. The only thing that works is to close that page and start a new one, hoping that another add does not show up.8) LAST but not least is the sound quality. Unfortunately, we have our contract with AT&T and the sound quality and OK at best. Most often is  very very poor.  But this is the AT&T problem, We have complained before and they blamed it on the phone and wanted us to get a new phone, well, here is a new phone and the sound quality is not any better.Do yourself a favor and don't get a Samsung galaxy type phone.                    I used this phone for over year.  On one hand, I liked that it was was light, glossy, has a bright, clear screen and is somewhat fast given the confusing and inefficient software.  Samsung has done everything they could to make this a great phone. But, Android is a cumbersome beast. This phone goes from 100% to 50% battery charge in a heartbeat and then the power saving kicks in, and it seems to work more efficiently but you've already lost half of your charge.  It's confusing to the point of madness and Android is filled with bugs too numerous to list. I have had all kinds of strange issues and Google offers no support whatsoever. So, I had to deal with any problems that came up and there were a ton.  I recently got an iPhone 5 and it is everything I hoped Anrdoid would be. Finally, Samsung adds all kinds of features, but they are not integrated well into the O/S because it wasn't really designed for them. For example, the typing on this phone is just awful, the autocorrect mistakes nearly every word and it is very difficult to move the cursor. Samsung's version of Swype works so poorly you will disable it immediately.                    This phone is great.  However, this international version is not compatible with AT&T's (or any) LTE network.  The reason for it is that the quad core processor of the inten'l version doesn't support LTE.  The US version was changed with a dual core Snapdragon 1.5 ghz processor so the phone would work with LTE speeds.                    This phone is the worst desicion. I had an iphone 4, i thought it got old so I decided to buy Galaxy S3, my BAD. Is bad quality, the OS is unstable i had many problems. I am waiting for Iphone 6                    I am not happy with this phone I bought from this company, I have problems with the settings, I am not able to setup my phone the way I want...
!###I have an addiction. I admit it. When I see headphones go up on lightning deals I instinctively hit buy. I have owned at least a dozen earbuds over the past few years. Everything from $5-$115. I am active and use these at the gym daily. I don't do cardio but sweat a ton when I work out. Before I even get into pros/cons let me tell you that these are the first pair to last 3 months without issue. No fading, no one ear out, nothing!Lets start:Pros:DURABILITY - As I said these are the first to last 3 months of daily sweating11/22/2013 update - 6 Months with no sound degradation. The hole in my heart that Sony has created is one that can never be filled. The days of rationalizing impulse headphone purchases are over. No longer will I feel the smooth lining of an unopened package of headphones. The thrill of the unknown, which is to say the inopportune times in which one ear would suddenly cut out mid workout. Sony has taken the fun of online shopping from me by making these headphones perfect. I guess i'll have to find another impulse purchase hobby.Cons:Appearance - Its no Giant B on your ear, but the disc that sticks out is ugly.Thoughts:I was not happy with these when I first purchased them. They sound better than JLab but not as good as Kplish S4I's. There is no over abundance of base, actually it is lacking a little. When turned all the way up the Bass under performs.Consistency is key here. I beat these things up and I'm confident in them every time I grab them and head to the gym. I've learned not to rate products on Sound quality alone. I've also learned to wait a few months before praising a product. How many times do people pick up their JLab headphones say "THESE THINGS ARE GREAT!" write a review and then 3 weeks later they break. How many of those people come back here and change their review? P.S. I was a faithful JLab customer until they messed me over on a pair of defective buds twice.There is absolutely nothing worse than showing up ready to lift with one earbud out and have Taylor Swifts terrible voice seep in from the broken ear. If you want headphones that last, go with Sony.Update: 8/18/2013They still sound exactly the same as when I first purchased them. No distortion, no partial loss of volume. Great quality!Update 11/22/2013Not a bit of sound degradation. Who will give up first, my headphones or gym regimen. Star upgrade from 4 to 5. I have never had a pair last this long under such strenuous conditions. I'm treating this review like a relationship, we have hit the 6 month mark so no more celebrations until our one year anniversary. If they should break before that time you can be assured that I will make an update, however if things are still lady and the tramp well then I expect to update you all in 6 months.Feel free to ask any questions below. Happy shopping!                    Sony MDR-EX210B $25Philips SHE6000 $18Klipsch IMAGE S4 $69Sony MDR-ED12LP  $12JVC HAFX1X vs  $18Etymotic ER23-HF3 $100Winner: Sony MDR-EX210BI have been listening to a lot of EDM, House, and Trance lately. I needed something with good bass. Not just muffled loud bass, but clear bass. I also of course I also wanted crystal clear mid's and high's.I tested all headphones with popular song "Walls" by Ned Shepard & Tiesto. In the first few seconds of the song there is a thundering bass that fades. Sony MDR-EX210B was the only headphone that allowed me to distinguish between the different bass notes and it felt thundering in an enclosed space like in a movie theater or at a rave right in front of the speakers, but yet was still crystal clear. 5 stars on comfort as well. Thanks Sony, you've still got it!                    I have used a lot of different headphones.  Bose, Klipsh, Sony, Panasonic...etc.  These Sony earbuds, for around $30, offer the best value by far.  I have used mine for only about two weeks so I can't speak to durability but the range they deliver is superior to most other earbud style headphones I have tried. They come with three different sizes (for the ear piece).  The middle ones fit my ears perfectly and don't slip when I'm working out (mainly running).  Terrific bass and crisp treble.  The only other headphones I have tried that are comparable cost around $100.                    I paid about $20 at Walmart for these, but after owning them for some three years, I would gladly pay the $49 here to replace them. They show no signs of breaking or wearing out, however, and their sound quality is just as good as ever. They produce strong bass and mids with no compromise in clarity. (As a bass player of seven years, I appreciate this more than most.) The muffled - too much mids - sound found in standard I-pod headphones is nonexistent, and the piercing - too much highs - sound found in others is not there either. These headphones maintain a perfect balance of sound throughout all kinds of music. They are also more comfortable than any other pair of headphones I have ever worn. It is possible to listen for hours without any discomfort so long as I am wearing the right size earpiece. (They give you three: small, medium, and large. I use small.)                    I'm not really an Audiophile,  but I play the Piano,  Guitar and Cello, so i know if something is out of tune or not right. Sony is known for their sound engineering throughout the years and I was kinda skeptical becuase of the price,  but to be staight forward, These Earphones are comparable to brands like Bower & Wilkins,  AKG and Harman Kardon, even with 16-bit music.It comes with a nice bag and a small cord adjuster.My Review:  Sound adapts to any genre and is really clear,  better than brands that people claim,  like Bose.Comfort:  No ear Pain so far,  Silicone is soft and doesn't have that &#34;stiff rubber feel&#34;.Bass:  Very Defined Surround feel,  Studio quality,  Perfect for listening to Orchestra Symphonies, Bass solos,  Rock and Pop.Mids:  PerfectHighs: Doesn't produce an annoying high sound,  good definition with Violin music and Pop.Sustain:  GreatVocals:  It's like the singer is singing beside you.Noise Isolation:  reduces around 70% in Noisy environments.has a minor hiss with some devices.Been using it for 1 Month.                    I have owned these headphones for a little over a week and they are great: sound is crisp, the bass is rich and vocals sound great, even at high volume. It comes with three sets of ear buds (small, medium and large), caring pouch and cable holder.  I listen to music on my Android Phone most of the time, but to really appreciate the true quality of the sound I'd recommend using an iPod,or any other "media dedicated" device.In my experience, with these kind of headphones, the ear buds you choose and how you put them in your ears make a huge difference in the quality of sound. I find myself listening to music for hours at a time without any discomfort in my ears.  The headphones are not noise cancelling, but they isolate very well the external noises at the right volume.  I want to point out the built of the product feels somewhat fragile so I would like to see how these headphones perform overtime.  They are very light and comfortable, but also the cable seems to be a little bit thin compared to some other headphones I've owned.  In my opinion, these headphones are worth the price and produce an excellent sound.                    I've owned $5 headphones and $100 headphones and these are worth just about the $15 I paid for them. Just keep in mind that they're $15 headphones and you'll be plenty satisfied.My praise for this set comes from it's design. Turning the drivers sideways allows for slightly deeper bass than other designs (although still on par with $15). I can never find headphones that fit in my ears but these will not budge even on a run (haven't tried under a helmet).The cord is my negative for this set, it's too long for PT use and the rubber used is not ideal for this application.                    I've been using this for about half a year.  I love how these headphones compare to the one I used to own don't break as easily for I am the type to throw my headphones in my bag even though they come with a little black pouch for you to store.  I find that their ear pieces don't fall off as easily as other headphones that I tried. Overall, I am happy with this product and am planning on buying another pair.                    The sound quality of the Sony MDR-EX210B/BLK Ear bud Style Headphones is great for the price.  The shape of these ear buds took a little to get use to but is comfortable to wear. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good sounding ear bud without empting the wallet.                    I was a bit skeptical about the sound quality of this item but that was all erased with the first use of this item. Bass is clear and virtually undistorted and highs are clear as well, and they are very comfortable to wear.
!###I am iphone earbud nut - have 6 pairs and this is by far the best bang for buck - Not static - rich full sound and 10 times better then anything outhere under 100 $$  A steal at 20 to 25$                    Definitely a fan of the sound quality, although compared to the Klipsch Pro-media earbuds I bought a couple years ago (on sale for $45), these don't come close. But hey, those are retail about $110, so won't judge too hard. The biggest downside is the cord. It feels like what you would find on a $10 cheapo set, but I paid $40 retail for these. I have pretty bad experiences with headphones, and a 90 day warranty with a poor-quality cord will probably result in a not so good situation. Will be returning them this week because of this. If you don't mind the low quality cable and are in it for the sound, I would recommend them. The bass is ridiculous! Mids and Trebles are sometimes washed out, but not too severely. sound-wise I would pay $30 for these. Cord-wise, maybe $20.                    as mentioned by the majority of other reviews, this set of headphones is a DEFINITE gold standard in terms of sound quality for the price. all you need to know is 5-24KHz freq range hits 98% of all audible nuances (and then some) that your music's dynamic range can muster out. make sure you load at least 192-320mbps mp3s/digital files and also adjust the eq function of your music device (a must for iOS products, iphones/ipods, who have the worst eq function of all digital players on the market).these buds really shine with sony digital walkmans like the EWZ-400 series (EWZ-475 sony digital walkman is my preferred mp3 device by default due to its extensive eq/sound tailorability specifically the heavy setting).there is a burn in period for the 13.5 mm drivers of these buds but it was substantially less for me than in some of the other reviews (give or take 2-3 wks of consistent use). the overall effect of the burn in was some extra clarity to the highs, bass on the other hand was fantastic right out of the box.;BLUF(bottom line up front)- avoid being shafted by the likes of Bose and Monster who tout $200+ for an impressive set of buds, learn the eq function of your player (would require some people to actually read the instruction handout of their purchase before using it), and get these. the buid quality is very good (7 out of 10) & not cheap feeling.UNADVERTISED HINT- if you want to hit even deeper bass notes than 5khz and your ears can tolerate the snugger fit, remove the medium buds that are installed on the drivers out of the box and put on the LARGE size ones. you'll open up a whole lower octave of bass.                    Fair warning: I am definitely not an audiophile, music expert, or anything.  I just like having music in my ears while I walk during the day (as a college student on a big campus, I walk a lot between classes), when I sit on the bus, whilst doing work in the library, etc.Context:Before these I had been using some $10 Phillips in-ear headphones I had bought from the drugstore, I knew they weren't great, but I dealt with them until they broke this summer.  After receiving some Bose over-the-ear headphones for Christmas last year, I became spoiled and had been lemming for some nicer in-ear headphones.  I started out on the smaller side of the price scale with these.  These Sony headphones were the best in-ear headphones I'd ever used until that point (and the most expensive, too).--The shortlist of ratings:SOUND: 5/5Sound was as good as I would have wanted, especially from headphones in this price range.  All of my music--indie, EDM, rap, bubblegum pop--sounded fine to me!  Bass was clearer than any of my cheaper earphones, and everything, all in all, felt clearer than what I had been accustomed to.  I'm sure other headphones might cancel more noise, but for what these are, I was totally happy.COMFORT/WEARABILITY: 4.5/5I have small ears or something, because I always have to use the smallest earbud.  With those, I could listen to music for a couple of hours with no discomfort.  I just feel like some (higher priced) headphones are actually more comfortable.  The other Sony headphones I purchased came with even more earbuds, but I have no complaints.  I didn't have much problem working out, but I didn't have a real chance to test it out, honestly.VALUE: 5/5Buying these was a great decision.  Losing them, not so much.  Came with:  3 different sized ear buds, the little thing that you could wrap the cord around (handy for people who like organized wires--can't wrap the whole cable around it but it's good enough I guess), and a felt bag.  So overall, great stuff at a great price.--Conclusion:I'm so sad I lost these so quickly, because I normally don't lose much.  I've already bought a new set of headphones (Sony-MDRXB60EX-GLD), which I've been using for a while, but I had a few issues adjusting to the extra bass initially (I like some bass but I'm not extremely hardcore, and a lot of my music doesn't utilize a ton of bass anyway).  These other ones are bulkier, which is also sometimes strange to me.I would consider repurchasing these Sony MDR-EX210B headphones again, if they're still available when I'm looking for in-ear headphones in the future.  Very much worth the value to someone who listens to a lot of music, but is not particular about all the ~fancy audio things.  However, I would also like to splurge on higher level ones at some point (just to check it out) so it will ultimately depend on budget whenever my current headphones break or disappear.                    I got these hoping a balanced, clear sound.  They fit the ear well and they feel good wearing them.  I find they are too boomy/bassy.  I ordered some less expensive Panasonic earphones at the same time and they actually have a more balanced tone, in my opinion. But I think I actually prefer a more open fit, like my sennheisser earbuds have.  If you like a real bassy club sound then you might love these.  My housemate thought it was a great sound.                    These earbuds are very better than I expected. They look cool, fits perfect and I am totally impressed with the Bass.I would definitely recommend this product.                    i love these ear buds so much i bought a backup pair.they can't be beat for the affordable price.they are comfortable and sound is great                    Just buy 'em. For what you're paying on Amazon, you're not finding better. These sound fantastic. Great separation of sound, clear through the entire range, and excellent vocals, both in music and podcasts.                    I like it.  It doesn't keep trying to fall out of my ear.  This is my third sets of earbuds I've bought.  The previous two had problems.  One - it didn't fit into my ear so it kept falling out and I had to keep adjusting it (very annoying and breaks focus).  Second - terrible drivers so the sound was horrible.  This - neither of those two problems.  I use it at work for 8-10 hours a day.  It does its job since I don't have to hear my loud coworker who sits 5 feet away from me.
!###Really good base to them if you know how to set your settings and sound great, I would recommend these if you like music with a better sound then most head phones ive heard. Sound better then beats but not as good of a base as them                    I purchased the Sony MDREX86LP/BLK Earbud Style Headphones back in February 2012 from another seller, and I was fairly satisfied with the quality for about the same price.  When it finally came time to replace them (about a month ago), amazon.com suggested this model, Sony MDR-EX210B/BLK, claiming that this version is the latest model of the MDR-EX86LP/BLK.  So I gave it a try.  I think the (bass) sound is really great for the price, but I'm unsatisfied with the quality (thinness) of the wires used.  The wires on the MDR-EX86LP/BLK (or at least the plastic wire wrapping) is at least 2x the diameter of the light-grey plastic covered MDR-EX210B/BLK wires.  As for being the &#34;latest model&#34; of previous earbud headphones that I had purchased, it seems more like a cut back or regression in quality from Sony.  They sound great now; but with normal wear, I'm just wondering how long these wire cords are going to last.The seller was prompt to process and deliver my order, and the product was packaged exactly as you might find at a retail store.  The product critique (and thus the product rating) does not reflect the quality of sales service that I feel I have received from the seller (Thank you, DBROTH).                    These earbuds are the worst design I have ever tried. The cords are so long that they catch on everything and the earbuds themselves are so heavy that their weight pulls them out of the ears when you move. I tried all the adapters that came with the earbuds hoping to find one that would help hold the buds in the ears with no luck.I was using these with my IPod when exercising but gave up and went back to the old original buds that came with the player.                    These headphones sound great for the money. Very satisfied. I would reccomend to anyone who wants a good pair of everyday headphones                    Great set of headphones, Beats by Dr. Dre that cost 6 to 7 times more & don't sound as good as these. True stereo sound                    For the price excellent soundinding ear plugs  no complaints fit nice in the earAnd I like the red for right ear and  regular for left iphone plugs are whack                    I bought this earbuds six month ago and I didn't regred, it sound amazing and support sweat and last more than the others one                    I am very pleased and surprised by the performance and sound quality of this headphones. I did not have the best of experiences with Sony's headphones from a durability standpoint. The phone jacks get loose with repeated use on iPods and one of the speakers goes out after a short while every time. So, I was hesitant to try another one after going through a half dozen different models in the past couple of years.These new pair sound rich and full. Bass is deep and full range clarity of sound rivals my much more expensive Kilpsch Image S4i headphones. Just wish the cords were flat, tangle free kind so overall quality of construction would match that of its sound. But at this price range, there is not much to complain since I can buy 3 of these for a price of a Klipsch S4i. Greatly Recommended.                    These earbuds are comfortable and cancel out most outside noises, even when you don't have music playing.  They sound pretty good, too.  Best of all, I accidentally washed them in my clothes and they survived!                    Good sound for an inexpensive earbuds. Bought it for my daughter who always gets her earbud wires tangled and knotted. The cord separater helps, but still gets a little tangled.
!###More like 3.25/5 stars.I bought these because I heard they were durable.  I guess I won't find out because my dumb-ass lost them yesterday.The bass was good, but it still lacked something.  I do listen to my music on a lossy format (MP3 320 mbps) and not a lossless format (like FLAC) and I have a good equalizer on my player, too (JetEffect 3.0 on the Cowon X7); but I know the quality of my music plays an important factor in the sound I hear.One more thing, try not to use the cord adjuster that it comes with.  I found myself pulling on the cord way too many times because of it.                    Comparing these to headphones twice the price (Woodees iESW101V) I preferred the sound that came from these. These are a great choice for someone who listens casually in moderate noise environments and doesn't want to spend a lot. They provide decent isolation and are fine for an hour-long listening session. They're a little bass-heavy, but not offensively so. My biggest complaint is that they don't stay in my ears particularly well, but at the price I paid, I don't expect them to do everything.Overall, I'd say these are not without their flaws, but they are great headphones in their price range.                    I usually create MP3's using VBR (LAME).  I use these headphone with my iPhone 4 (work) as well as my SanDisk Sansa MP3 player.  The sound is amazing.  I am hearing things I've never heard before.  These are a definite improvement over any stock headphones and I prefer them to the Sony MDR-EX56 headphones that they replaced as well as some Sennheiser CX300II that I tried but didn't prefer.  Everyone's taste varies, esp when it comes to headphones.  I can only say that I am very happy with this purchase and had I known my music could sound so good, I would have made the investment a while ago.                    Love these earbuds. Good quality. They drown out annoying outside noise. I definitely recommend them. I've tried many others and these are the best so far.                    These sound great, the bass is crisp and the mids/highs are clear.  I've been using these almost every day since I've received them for music and late night movies/gaming.  They block out noise a lot better than other earbuds I own.  ( had the wife nagging at me from across the room and I had no clue at all until she got mad and smacked me, lol)I haven't had any distortion or muffled tones, but I haven't cranked the volume to max, I'd be afraid of going def, these go plenty loud.                    the shipping was prompt and on time... very well made and great sound for the money; definitely recommend over the very cheap models with good low/mid/high's ... may fail against bose or other $100 pairs but for $30 they're great!                    I had been using this sony earbuds for a some time now and it really like the details in the sound and the deep bass!! I also compared it with the highly rated Klipsch Image S4. I can now say for sure and recommend this Sony earbuds over the Image s4 for the sound experience and the build quality is also much better. The Klipsch image S4 is really flimsy construction and it fell apart in just 3-4 months. The only small complain i have is the the fit . I just can't wear this earbud for a long time even though I really like the sound and the overall quality of music. It just gives you a whole new experience for the same old songs... just amazing sound!!                    These were purchased for my teenage son for Christmas.  He loves them, the sound quality and comfort.  He is a bass player and loves the bass sound he gets from these buds!                    Fit snugly in my ear, don't slip out.  Sound is perfectly balanced.  Amazing value for the price.  I highly recommend these.
!###These earbuds are better than the ones I got from Raidio Shack ($50). They bring movies and music alive! They have rich, deep sound and work great!!! Well worth the price.                    Great sound...excellent bass and clarity!  Just make sure that you adjust the size of the eadbud to get a good tight fit in your ear.  Some noise cancelling but doesn't feel like you're in a bubble, and completely isolated from the outside world.  The trick is to get the earbud far enough into your ear but not so that it causes discomfort.  Very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.  You will have to adjust them after a period of time, and they will slip out if not adjusted periodically.  I like the cord winder for working out so that you don't have too much of the cord hanging and getting in the way.  And for the price, I would recommend these to anyone that really enjoys listening to a lot of music that requires a good amount of extended-bass.  Just wish it came with a headphone extension cable like the higher priced models, but hey...for $25, you can't go wrong!  I plan to use these with my wireless monitoring system when I play with my band too!                    My son likes this headphone more than the one came with Samsung Galaxy III.  It seems like a good product.                    They sound great and they fit pretty good. Wires are a pain but the little clip helps. I would buy em' again.                    The buds fit perfectly and stays in place on my walks, and when I prefer &#34;alone time&#34;. Being able to answer my phone is a plus!                    These are good headphones for the price.  You do get a little more bass than other headphones I own.  I like the cord wrap and the colored ear buds so its easy to tell which is left and right.                    I think these Sony Earbuds are just great!  Great sound for the price.  They stay in place.  They are comfortable.  What more could anyone ask for.
!###Great for the price! I bought these to listen to heart and lung sounds for PA school. The sound is crisp and clear, and the bass seems wonderful. Obviously I'm not a sound technician, but they work PERFECTLY for what I wanted them to do!                    They are pretty good, sound is decentSometimes the fall off but the reason is because when I wear them (the way i wear them) the cord is too small for my use.but it rarely happens. so I am happy with them.                    It is for my daughter, she loves it so much! she carries it whereever she goes. It is inexpensive and with good quarlity, best for a teen.                    These Headphones are great! I love the sound. They kinda look cheap. I just had really bad luck with these headphones, they last me 2 weeks. And it's not because they were defective, it was because my little nephew chewed the ear buds haha switched to bigger ones, and my dog chewed the cable :( I would definitely will buy again!                    Listening to music is personal choice , A lot depends on your age and how good your hearing is ,I think this a good product with good sound ,at a very good price ,You can spend ten times more for this kind of product ,with very little or no Better results  .  For the price I think it's good quality .And I like this prodct.                    I didn't really know what to expect from these headphones, but the sound quality ended up being better than my previous pair of Bose headphones that cost a lot more.  I was extremely impressed by this product.                    I bought these earphones after reading positive reviews on Amazon. These are a disappointment after coming from the Creative EP-630s. The earphones look flimsy and cheap and are nowhere near how the EP-630s sound.I also never could find the right fit among the 3 sizes of plugs.The mid size plugs were uncomfortable to wear and the large ones start to cause ear pain after an hour or so which never happened with the EP-630s.Typically, the mid size ones fit almost everyone universally.                    The sound quality is fine for the price, but the earbuds do not fit me correctly. They are uncomfortable and fall out. There are multiple size options for the pads but none of them solved my problem.                    Very good bass from this Sony Earbud. Much better than the standard iPhone earbud. The sound is very good for the price I paid and I am happy with this purchased. The only slight problem is that the Earbud tend to fall out of the ear with the slightest tug. Other than that I am satisfy with the purchased.                    I have had these ear buds for almost 3 months now and they are still working great.  Amazing sound, especially for only $20.  Some of the longest lasting ear buds I have ever used, especially since I use them non stop. Great buy.
!###Normally I am incredibly hard on ear buds so I tend to buy the cheapest I can find and use them up and toss them with nary a qualm about doing so.  I used a cheap $10 pair of skullcandy ear buds for over a year before one side finally quit at the worst time so I was desperate for something right away.  Found these in a lightning deal and I must admit at around 20 bucks it was a little more than I was comfortable paying but the reviews swayed me and like I said, I was desperate.I didn't give them any break in time at all (I was desperate remember), yet I nearly wept at the thought of how I had used inferior cheap buds for so long.  These sound amazing!  They should not be even linked in the same class as other cheap ear buds.  The bass is excellent and the full range may not be amazing to an audiophile but for me I was stunned.  I heard nuances in my music that I had long forgotten.In addition to the sound quality the cord is long enough to stretch from a watch pocket while I work and not get bound up or pull the buds out of my ears.  The tips are different from what I am used to and quite comfortable and the little drawstring bag is a nice touch.  The L shaped connector is a bit awkward sometimes but seems to prevent a lot of the pulling stress and has prevented a few accidental disconnects that I have had with cheap buds in the past.Solid construction, amazing sound and, size variety in the tips make this an excellent pair of buds I hope will last a long time and I will never go back to those cheap flimsy things again.                    These pairs of headphones are not like any other headphones.  They sound like the more expensive ones yet are very cheap!! I was surprised by the clarity and the bass output on these tiny ones!! Definitely worth the money and More!!                    I hesitated buying these because of the odd shape but I like them more than my old Sony MDR 71's, Klipsch S4's.  Maybe not as clear as the Klipsch but fuller sound.                    I am very pleased with the audio quality. These are good enough to substitute for my excellent audio-technica monitors sometimes (I'd probably look like a dork sitting poolside with full size headphones on my head). I am very impressed. I think the isolation of the in-the-ear design allows these small drivers to reproduce a much more solid bass and midrange without the tinniness I have encountered in monitor headphones twice the price. The only downside is it might take a while to get used to the in-the-ear style compared to surround earphones or apple earbud style.  They feel like earplugs, but after a few hours of use, the have become very comfortable. I recommend these highly for portable use, they sound great and I have compared them to over-the-ear monitors costing 2x to 3x the price.  Also, a good step up in sound quality over the default apple buds, and I thought the apple buds were good enough for on the go, until I tried these.                    These replaced a pair of stock Sony ear buds. While they were pretty good, these sound even better, with more bass and volume. A really good bargain. According to the Sony website, they don't make these any more.                    The sound is great, however the cord is too long for what I am using them for.  I had to buy another pair, but I will use these headphones as a backup pair.  If you like long cords with your headphones then I would recommend this particular brand and model - if you don't then these are not the headphones for you.                    Good sound with my ipod through these. Main use is with running. I curl all earbuds over my ear from the back. This eliminates cord noise. Don't forget you have an EQ in your ipod to add or reduce bass, etc. I also have an earbud product with a &#34;J&#34; in it. I started with those and like them. I think they may stay in my ear a little better, but the sony's sound a little better in a side by side test, which helps when listening to MP3 quality. Sometimes I use them to listen to TV late at night by running a cord to the headphone jack of my stereo with TV audio input. It is much more comfortable than heavy over the ear headphones that squeeze your head. I have had no quality problems with either brand. I don't pull them out of my ear by the cord.                    Exactly what I needed! These headphones are such a bargain for the price. I'll definitely be buying another pair soon.                    these are awesome! Its better than listening through your car stereo. if feels like ur at a concert. thank you so much for the most terrific quality buds and the price is unmatched.!                    I have tried countless iterations of ear-bud style headsets. It's always the same problem they refuse to stay in my left ear, and are always popping out. I have even tried other ear buds of similar design but suffer the same problem.  These surprisingly however stay in using the default adapter size. They are very comfortable when worn for a long period of time as well. In a five mile run I did not have to readjust them once.  Sound quality is amazing, with very deep bass response, but this does seem to sacrifice a bit of high end fidelity and can be corrected with tweaking the EQ settings on the device you are using. Sound isolation is very good with these, but just note that when walking you cannot hear cars coming up on you if you walk on the incorrect side of the road.  The only complaint with these so far is due to the sound isolation design, there is a lot of noise transmitted to your ears if you brush the wire. Other than that these headphones are amazing for the price.  Worth every penny.Pros:Secure fit and do not come lose.Amazing bass response.Comfortable.Reasonable cost.Cons:Treble is a tad weak for ear buds.Sound transfer via cable. (typical for this type of headset)
!###The sound is excellent  and they are easy to handle and there are small ear pieces included. these are the best earbuds I've had so far!                    These are good, specially for the price.  They arrived in the right amount of time and were packaged well.  The sound is very clear for the price point.  I've never had earbuds with this thin of cord, and I can't comment on that part one way or the other.  Time will tell how those stand up.My only complaint/wish is for an XS earbud covering.  However, this is an issue I find with many earbuds.So, if you have average to large sized ear holes, these are great without breaking the bank.                    Really good for the price the only thing is it said that the blue earphones were discontinued so i don't get how they are still selling them                    These are the ones to get. I ordered these and the Panasonic RPHJE120K ear buds at the same time to compare. I've got about 10 pairs of various buds around my house and the only ones that sound even close to as good as these are my iphone buds.                    I bought these earbuds to replace my Sony mdr ex083's that I got with my Sony walkman. Prior to using those, I had just been buying the cheapy ones from Wal-mart or Target, so I was FLOORED with the quality. A year ago, I decided to look them up and I discovered how pricey they were, but for good reason. After three years, they broke so I needed replacements, but I wasn't willing to pay too much.I bought these expecting them to be of a lower quality than the other ones, but to what degree I wasn't sure. The first thing I noticed when I put them in was that they have VERY good, clear bass, and they don't really sacrifice the treble for it. They do sound slightly more muddled than the ex083's, but I expected that.In short, 5/5 because I got what I paid for, they are excellent, and are bound to surprise anyone who is switching from default earbuds. I am looking to get some even better ones later on, but these are sure to satisfy me for the next two or three years.                    So far so good with the Sony Earbud's...The sound quality is great, fits the ears comfortable, no distortion, lows and highs are clear&#8230;Would buy again&#8230;T                    Excellent sound quality for the money and a comfortable fit.  I thought these earphones were decent with the medium tips, but after I changed to the largest tips, resulting in a much better seal, The lower bass range appeared as if by magic and everything that I listened to came through very clearly.                    These little buds work better than the Sony MDR-1Rs which I am promptly returning after a whole 6 minutes of use. The bass is clean, the mids and highs are sharp, and you feel totally engulfed in the sound. When I have them on, I can't even hear anything else around me.Best $30 I've ever spent!!                    Great bass, tempos, sound quality and overall great for music on the go. For the price, these earphones have great sound canceling.                    These headphones have good sound when you put them in your ears, but getting them to stay there is nearly impossible. I got these because I wanted a pair of quality headphones to wear in the gym, but they literally fall out of my ears every 3 minutes making it almost impossible to appreciate the quality of the acoustics. I've tried all three sizes they give in the packaging and none have stayed in.
!###Came on time and as advertised. Has 3 sizes of buds to fit your ears. Also has a nice wire holder to wrap the wire up that is extra when you are using it in mobile mode.                    I bought it for my mom for her mp3 player and she's pleased with it. Sound and length was both okey for daily use.                    I love these.  The sound quality is awesome, they come with various sized buds and a little bag to keep everything in.  Great quality and I recommend that you buy more than one whenever they are on sale.  These are awesome.                    Just got these headphones, they sound better than most expensive headphones and actually fit comfortably in the ear. These headphones are a steal, do yourself a favor and pick them up!                    I like that the bass is awesome. Cord looks a bit tin but no problems so far while working out at the gym.                    Delivery was excellentits comes in closed box, very nice.the headphones is excellent.The sound is excellent.But the cord is looks very cheap.                    These are great quality earphones. I would put them in a line up of ones that cost ~$50. The rubber bit that's used to organize the chord doesn't seem to be able to hold the entire chord wrapped up, but maybe I'm just wrapping it wrong.                    I couldn't get the earbuds of these headphones to fit snugly in either of my ears; they kept slipping out every few seconds.  I tried the replacement pair that came in the box but had the same problem.  I've never had this problem with other pairs of earbud-style headphones previously.  I think the problem is a combination of poor design and cheap materials.  Needless to say, I would not purchase these again at any price.                    These are the best sounding earbuds I've owned.  You would be hard pressed to find a better pair for a better price.                    For the past three years I used an expensive set of Shure in-ear headphones (paid more than $200 for them at the time). Finally the cord failed close to the jack after intensive use for exercise and travel.  This is where most earphones tend to fail sooner or later, especially if they have a straight connection to the cable (not L-shaped).  So I was looking for a light new set with an L-shaped jack.  I was surprised to find many relatively cheap sets with good reviews.  Decided to give the Sony MDR-EX210B a try, since the price of around $20 allows you to try several others if needed without breaking the bank.  I did not need volume control or a mike in the cable.  They only add weight in the cable, which can be an issue when exercising.  I must say, after only two days of use I am very impressed.  The bass of these headphones (a weak point of the Shure set) is truly impressive.  Overall there is still a good balance between highs, mid and bass.  The bass however is almost comparable to traditional over-the-ear headphones.  It seems that the development of in-ear headphones has come a long way in recent years.  I have also used infrequently the Samsung headphone set that came with my Galaxy SIII about a year ago, but there is no comparison, the Sony headphones are much better.  I have used them for stretches of several hours and they remain very comfortable.  I use the largest earbuds as provided, also because they isolate very well and stay in my ear even when exercising for an hour or more.  My only concern is durability, since the cable seems very thin.  I will have to wait and see how long these will last with intensive use.  For now I am very happy with them.
!###These are great little ear phones! The quality of the sound is excellent! Great product!!!I'm very pleased with this product!                    Good sound quality (for the price) only bad thing I can say is the earbuds are uncomfortable for long use.                    These are probably the best earphones I have ever had, even better than the armature set I got from Sony (except for the tangle free cord). Unfortunately I lost this set and they had gotten ran over by the time I got them back. I'll definitely be buying another pair soon though.                    Excellent ear buds with great sound for the price. Very good noise isolation when fitted in the ear canal.May get the same ear buds with a microphone to make it easier to use with my IPhone.                    Sony ear buds are the best for the price. Great fit, great sound and as always nice bass. Shipping was quick! Great experience.                    In a world of cheap, in-durable, lame earbuds and in-ear headphones, not all get the chance to stand out and allow them to take your money.This is a pair that may not make an audiophile grin ear-to-ear but it will satisfy the needs of a middle school or high school student needing a closed in boomin' listen.I bought these originally as throw-away headphones to use with my online courses in school, videos and more. I expected the bare minimum [sound quality wise] out of them. After receiving them in their exquisite Sony famous packaging, I popped them in with the default tips (also expecting the bare minimum out of these) and found they fit my big ears well! I was surprised any brand could make a tip that fit so perfectly in my complicated ears!I own Sony MDR XB500's, AKG 240k's, Koss PortaPro's and Klipsch Image S4's and I find myself using these the most. Are they better than all of those other buds/cans? Of course they don't compare, but the security, ease of use, and isolation brings me to pull them out first; they come at the most convenience.My only personal flaw: The cord, build and length. I like longer cords that give me a little &#34;wiggle room&#34; when using earbuds not to have them dismounted from my earlobes so quickly when I stand up or such. No complaining thereThe build is what you should expect out of $10 JVC buds at Walmart, thin, flimsy, noodly, and stringy. If the cord was a bit thicker, stiff and rough to the touch, that would make these feel a little more respectable and &#34;modern&#34; as they attempt to be.The build matches this. I know nothing of the durability because I've owned them for a few weeks but they haven't changed a bit.Side Note: I think the black color would look a little more masculine or modern, the blue is a little childish and less bold navy color, do not recommend the blue.Cheers on your purchase!                    Nice balanced sound, no static. Fits really well in ears.Bass not too impressive but alright. Would buy again if they broke.                    I'm no audiophile, but to me I found that these ear buds do a great job with all of the sounds in the music. Rock or classical the sound is clear and sharp. I do miss having a volume control on the ear bud cord but with this quality sound for the price I'll happily do without the extra volume control.                    I thought I was not gonna be satisfied with these headphones...  but after opening them and  trying them on I was very surprised how the sound is so clear the you can really hear the base and how it seals your ears from all the noise  and you listen to the music only  LOVE THIS PRODUCT                    The price for these ear buds isn't bad but which is why I can't complain too much. I was just hoping the wire would be of better quality because the audio is already starting to cut in and out. If these stop working tomorrow, I would't be surprised or upset.
!###I know that they snobby audiofiles think Sony isn't cool enough, but I bought a pair of the &#34;recommended&#34; ear buds from MEElectronics and rejected them after 10 seconds of use.  These Sony's sound awesome.                    It was a pretty good earphone right up until 11 months later, when one earphone went out, a month after that and it completely doesn't work. Lame.                    I bought those sony earbuds about a month ago, and they're just perfect. Great sound quallity and bass. And also really cheap.Totally recommended.                    I had one of those tangle free Sony ear buds. Lasted a few years and then went kaput. Decided to get cheaper ones. I like the sound that this one produces. I don't mind the form factor. The only thing that bothers me is that the thin cord tangles, but that's typical for this style headphones.                    Best sounding headphones you can get for anywhere near this price! I brought a $70 pair of Audio Technica headphones myself that I decided to return and these even sounded better! It also sounded better than my brother's $90 beats by dr dre.                    If the ear buds fit well, this set can reduce nearby noises. There can be some noticeable bass depth, but not always (not with voices).                    If you are looking for a new pair of headphones for either everyday wear or for working out these headphones are great. Very crisp sound, GREAT lows, and they are great at locking in the music you want to hear and blocking out the background noise you don't want to hear. I will update in the future if I encounter any problems!                    They fit comfortably. I now hear nuances of speech and music I was previously missing. Would recommend for others in search of an inexpensive pair of buds for everyday use (iPhone user).                    These are great. I've cycled through a lot of headphones, always looking for something with decent bass, good noise-canceling, and durability. I work at a job where focus is essential and I'm easily distracted, so I use these day in and out to listen to music and even sometimes without turning on my music to just help block out the noise. I feel like you absolutely can't do better for the price and honestly often double or triple this price fails in one of those categories. This is my second pair... not because the first stopped working, but because it occurred to me I should probably have a spare in case my initial pair got lost or damaged. Awesome product.                    These headphones are amazing,Sony has done it again! they are really comfortable,I definitely recommend them to any type of user.
!###They have good sound. They will fall out of ear easy. Did not hurt my ears,  comfortable for a long time.                    Very good product, the sound is excellent, but the cables seem a bit delicate for the material, but I had no problems.                    Granted I'm not an afficiondo and no expert, but after waiting for these to arrive *I'm deployed* I will say they are the best I've heard so far.  The price was excellent *$25-$28.00*, and the sound is REALY rich and full.  If you are deployed and are hesitant because you are worried about getting quality *like i was*.  You know you don't want to pay for something to find out it's only marginal or just meets your needs.  I will tell you that this product totally exceeded my expectations.                    These headphones are excellent. They are extremely comfortable, stay in your ear well, and have great audio quality. I would recommend this product for anyone who wants to buy an underpriced pair of headphones.                    They have really nice bass and sound but the wire is really thin so you should be careful how you use your headphones.                    The quality of sound of these headphones, I swear, are beyond what I expected. I personally can't believe people buy Beats headphones for $150&#62; when you can get such amazing, crystal clear with deep bass sound that RIVAL Beats quality on these headphones for this price! It's hard to find good headphones at stores, especially when they don't come with specs. I was looking for something that could deliver powerful sound, and this is totally what I was looking for. Couldn't be happier with them.                    These earbuds were AMAZING but only lasted about half of a year. The sound was clean and crisp and made me only want to listen to my music more. These are the best earbuds I have ever tried but they just didn't last as long as I expected for its price (and reviews). These are WONDERFUL but don't expect them to last longer than a year.                    Had to replace my Bose earphones when the wires all came apart. Bought these hoping they would sound just as good as Bose. Have to say, they give great sound to my Ipod and the buds are very comfortable. I would definitely recommend them. Can't beat the price.                    No doubt,The quality of sound is impressive!If  you don't have enough money,this is your choice,just belive me, no regret, worth the price.                    I purchased these after reading several reviews.  Very happy.  I use them mainly with my little SanDisk MP3 player, which allows the player to give me incredible sound enjoyment.  The earbud set enclosed with the SanDisk is just okay, until one experiences these.  The headphones arrive with a choice of three earbud cover sizes for maximum comfort.  The design allows for a good fit, which gives one more motion without them popping out.  For safety, use when not driving a vehicle, as well as when attention to one's surroundings is required.
!###Based on the reviews I was really hoping these headphones would be all that and more. They are good headphones, but not any different sounding than the pair I bought from Walmart for 10.00. Especially compared to the Isport headphones that my husband got for Christmas.                    Sound quality is great with nice bass but the cord is really cheap.  The cord tangles easily and has memory of the last coil.  Not sure what Sony was thinking.  I expect the cord to fail within a year.                    I am accustom to better ear buds.  These buds are a joke.  The sound is muffled, but it does have bass - muffled sounding bass.  Do not waste your money.The build quality is terrible.  The cables are made of the cheapest materials.  Sony should be ashamed of producing this junk.  I would say these buds are worth about ten dollars.  These buds are alright for listening to audio books (speech), but not music.My Recommendation:If you are looking for pure sound reproduction checkout the line of ear buds made by Etymotic Research.  Even their cheapest buds have outstanding sound reproduction.                    I purchased these ear buds because the store did not have any Skullcandy ear buds in stock so, I thought I should give these a try. I am really impressed with the sound quality. I like to use ear buds when I workout. Once I started to sweat, I was disappointed with the feel. I noticed that the factory bud ends had a slippery feel to them, which causes me to frequently adjust them while exercising. This annoys me the most. If you want premium ear buds that will give you good sound and create a tight seal in your ear to block out the sweat while you workout, These are not the best choice.                    Has absolutely no bass, not even with bass boost switched on. In addition they won't stay in the ear. If there is any redeeming feature of these earphones I have no idea what it would be. Completely worthless, went straight to the trash can.                    i always by the cheap skullcandys but i decided to upgrade. but theses thing are junk unless you dont plan to use them in a gym/running                    The headphones work Fine, but I am recovering from a horrible delivery because it took two whole days from the day it was supposed to be delivered to receive my purchase. I live in an apartment so our mailboxes are very small wich means that the box that my headphones came in could not be fit into the mailbox by the mailman (usps) so instead of him (the mailman) taking my order back to the post office he decided to give it to the people at the rent office for me to pick up later which was a bad choice because these people are so unprofessional they open and close the rent office when they want . For now on I'll get the quickest shipping I can afford.
!###So far so good. I got these for my trip to Mexico. I usually get skull candy headphones, but they usually go bad in about 3-6 months. I've had these for a month now and I like the fit and design. Sound is pretty good for the price, better than the skull candy I normally get.                    im ordering another one for my brother. it was just as good as the $79 pair i had and more comfortable                    Came on time, original packaging, great fit, great bass, great sound for the money (15 bucks) if you are looking for great sound, in ear fit, grab these, one down size is the cord is a little on the thin size, but other than that, great deal                    These are the best ear buds I have ever used. I have gone through plenty of ear buds generally thinking they were good. Until I tried these then I was aware of what truly good ear buds are. Durability has been tested they are extremely durable, they survived 3day in the rain after a car wreck with no loss of sound or any noticeable damage.                    I love everything about these ear buds. The bass is true and hefty, which is marvelous. The quality of these headphones are great, considering I paid under $10 for them. I only have two small complaints. For as nice as Sony ear buds are (these are not my first), I was surprised at how cheap the cord felt. For the first time I felt like the cord would fall apart right out of the box. The good news, while these aren't the best quality Sony's  I have had in this price range, after a few weeks the cord felt less starchy and more like a regular cord should feel. One other small complaint: I am a runner, so it's important for me to include music during my excursions. With these ear buds, despite the different sized pieces, I can't get the ear buds to stay in my ear while running, and when they are in, you can clearly hear your footstep drop as a large thud in your ear. I have had ear buds in the past that never made a sound other than my music playing, so I know its possible to fix that issue. Other than that, I love the way they sound, crisp and deep. I have never had a pair of ear buds near this great for a price to modest. Good job Sony, 4/5.                    The ear bud has great sound.  Best one when you compare to all other budget one.  Sony still leading in this area.  The only complaint is the color looks not very fashion.  I should get a red or bright color one....                    These are the best headphones I've found for this price.  Great bass and clear mid-tones and treble.  Durable and easy to store without getting tangled.  Great product!                    Everything worked as advertised, but cord is a little shorter than expected or at least hoped for. Very good sound and fit tightly in ear.                    I bought these to replace some beats that stopped working and these don't fall out of my ear while working out. I would highly recommend.  The bass is nice and not overwhelming.
!###of course shortly after buying these I found the Klipsch headphones I'd thought I'd lost. For the price these are very nice sounding headphones, not quite to the level of the $50 Klipsch but for $15 bucks they are a great deal.                    I'm no audiophile by any means but I really like the sound quality of these headphones, the design is a bit wierd but other than that, satisfied with my purchase.                    I bought this after reading several reviews and it was a good decision.  I found it clearer then several other brands that I own and some of them were priced higher.  I use these when I walk my dog so I can't provide much feedback, but I highly recommend them.                    Accidentally washed these AND THEY STILL WORK! They were in a pocket and discovered BEFORE putting them in the dryer. The sound is great, good bass. The plug is L-shaped which is great if your headphone jacket it at the top of your phone (mighty not work for you if the jack is at the bottom). Very happy with this purchase. Only $15...you just can't beat machine wash defying quality sound for that price.                    I have never been let down by sony.  Try these with a walkman and you wont be disappointed. For the price, it doesn't get much better than this.                    Just don't think too much, and sit back, enjoy the clear sound backed with heavy bass. At this price, nothing else match this awesome pair by Sony!                    They sound better than average.  Good highs, good Bass and fit really well.  The flat design makes it easy to adjust them to your ears.  Glad I bought them.  Plus, the thinner plastic surround of the mini jack material allows a good fit to my iPhone with the protective case installed.                    Great earphones for the price! Got them for my sister's birthday and they are amazing for how much they cost, and they actually do an alright job of cancelling out background noise. I highly recommend these headphones for anybody on a budget but want some quality sound. Shes now had them for 4 months and they are covered in her paint(Shes an artist)and it still works perfectly.***DO NOT GET SKULL CANDY EARPHONES AT THIS PRICE!***Mine broke within a few months.                    My teenage son loves these earbuds.  He said they sound very clear and slightly better than his Skullcandy.  I think he uses them too much.  Can't hear me when he's wearing these listening to his MP3, or maybe he just pretends not to hear me.Great value for price.  Especially when the blue cost less than the other colors, and blue was what we wanted.                    For $16, these headphones are wonderful. I use them in the gym with my ipod nano. The three different size earbuds were sized well and the large ones hold them in while running without discomfort. The bass is admirable. I have seen some headphones for less with better bass, but they have been uncomfortable, cheap quality or both. I've had these for a month and recommend them.
!###Most of my earbuds last around one or two months, but these have lasted six and are still going strong. The sound quality is excellent for what they are, a good, reliable, cost-efficient pair of earbuds. I wouldn't hesitate to buy these. The structure doesn't look particularly durable but i've had no problems with durability over the six months i've had these. Couldn't be happier.                    Can't beat the online price and the sound is very good. They give a good range of sound through the highs and lows. Nice to have a choice of earpiece sizes, (s, m, l) for personal fit. I recommend them as very good all purpose in-ear phones.                    The Best earbuds without spending a fortune. You hear only the sound in you ear...just be sure to adjust the size of the earbud (referring to the three sets that come with it) After that it's crisp sound and thumping bass. Best of all they stay in while active: Jogging/Biking.                    Have not rcvd my order yet. But I had Sony earbuds before and after reading  the reviews I know they're going to be ok for me. But what I noticed here on Amazon they coat $10 less than the same earbuds that are black. So I went for the blue ones And saved $10. Go figure you pay extra $10 foe the black ones anyone else noticed this...BobbyG                    I just got these yesterday... They were being sold for $40 at some places, but I found them for $13 on here so I couldn't pass them up. I had been using JVC Marshmallows prior to this, but they quit working. These earbuds are much more comfortable and have much better sound quality than the Marshmallows. I use them with my Sony Walkman MP3 player and would recommend them to anyone looking for good sound at an affordable price.                    I received different set of ear buds as a Christmas gift last year.  They were higher end Logitech UE (Ultimate Ears), model 350vi. They were very nice, comfortable and pumped out great sound/bass.  Unfortunately, I recently had one of the UE ear buds slip off while riding my bike...and of course, the bud went right through the meat grinder of my gear sprocket.  I went on Amazon to look for an exact replacement of the damaged Logitech UE's, but was surprised at how expensive this gift was.  I then looked for an alternative at a more reasonable cost, and read reviews of these SONY's -- decided for the money, what do I have to lose?Well, while I'm not an audiophile with a finely tuned ear, I do have to say that the sound quality seems easily to be at least 85-90% as good as the Logictech, but at only about 1/4th of the cost!  As for the comfort, the ear bud is just as comfortable, and so far the silicone buds seem to stay on the ear bud better than the Logitech's did.  SONY supplied 3 sizes of silicone inserts, while the Logitech supplied 4 or 5 different sizes.My only wish for these SONY's is more substantial cords, as the cords on this SONY pair are very thin, and therefore can tangle easy if you ball them up to put in a pocket, purse, etc.  It does come with a small velvet drawstring bag that you can store them in, but most people can't be bothered with that level of discipline.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase, and will tell family members to ditch their old, hard, over-sized white iPod Apple earphones & replace them with these great SONY Buds.                    the headphones work good and look good but the headphone jack is at a 90 degree angle so it does not fit in your pocket well. I personally prefer the straight up ones but I settled. over all it is a good pair if head phones :)                    The quality is amazing for the price! I have gone through so many headphones, and I always come back to Sony. They're comfortable and the sound quality is great. You will not be disappointed!                    ok earbuds but bass is not stellar. I have an old pair of Panasonic buds that are falling apart but still sound better. Got these Panasonic at Fry's on sale for about $25 3-4 yrs ago...                    These are very good headphones rich bass and tones are very sharp. They hold in my ears very well while I work and they never fall out. Very comfortable can wear them all day no problems.
!###I love these earbuds incredibly so. I was devastated when I couldn't find them and then pulled them out of the dryer from being in my pant's pockets. What do you know, they still work! After being in the washer AND dryer, they work as good as they did day 1. I can't recommend these enough, I even bought them for $40 at Target and I still think they were underpriced. I'm a Sony earbud user for life now.                    A good product that works as good as Sony says. Always try to buy their products when possible. Yada Yada.                    I travel on business a lot and go through headphones and ear buds due to losing them or damage.  I bought these to replace the ones my dog chewed up.  These are great.  I use them on planes and they block other noices. I use them when I walk and they stay in the ear with no problems.  They provide good sound and are comfortable even to have in the ear to go to sleep.  I also bought these for my wife.  She wears them to work out and also loves the comfort and sound they produce.  I would definitely recommend buying these.                    Excellent sound, quality ear buds and deep base for the price. One can not go wrong with these ear buds for the price.                    Was disappointed w/ such fragile wires. they should be a bit "heavier"After trying all sorts if earbuds I've come to the conclusion that "Skull Candy" are the best for the price.Wouldn't recommend these or buy again.                    As soon as I open the package, plugged them in to my phone and blasted some music. You can truly feel a great difference if you have been using some cheap headphones before. Definitely a buy!                    I ordered these for a friend who was VERY particular about the sound of his earphones. Nothing he listened to seemed to compare to the Sony ex86 iems that were stolen from him. Until he listened to these, which he has owned for about 4 months now. Right out of the box the bass was too forward but it settled down the longer we listened to them. Sound presentation is like this: &#34;Sparkling&#34; highs, forward lows, and a slightly recessed mids. The only earphones I have in the price range to compare to these to are the Meelectronics M6, which is inferior in all aspects of sound. The sonys have a more tight, controlled lower frequency and less recessed mids which sound good with many genres of music. The only negative thing I have on this set is how thin the wires are (they feel sturdy enough though). They come with four sets of the Sony hybrid tips (not the noise isolations tips that have foam in them).I'm surprised these don't get any attention on sites like Head-fi, especially at their current price point. Highly recommended.                    These in ears actually outperform in ears that are 150$ (specifically the Sony XBA-3iP). The bass is really nice without becoming muddy.                    I sleep with these headphones in, and they're a lot more comfortable than others I've tried. Sound is a little better than average.                    great sounding, I mean it really sounds great for the price...I am sure Beats By Dr Dre may be better to pay $180 or more is not justifiable! I own other pairs and they're cheaper and greater than those, but these SONY do the job and more...
!###so nice to be able to use earbuds!  I normally have to get over the head headphones, due to not finding a good fit.                    These headphones are amazing and were also pretty cheap. They have good bass which is what I wanted and they have pretty good sound quality overall. These headphones are definitely worth it especially for the price.                    I have never really bought a good pair of earbuds before.  The difference in these and the cheap ones islike day and night. The sound and quality is so much better. Can really enjoy them on my riding lawn mower and bike.                    Just got 2 pairs delivered earlier today. I knew it is going to be a wonderful investment when I Amazon is giving it for 15 bucks so I ordered an extra.I am totally pleased with the class of sound these are capable of producing. I own an LCD2, AH-D600 and an RSA SR-71B, so I know what music should sound like, and believe me for 15 bucks, you can't beat these awesome earbuds. Go for it while you still can.                    I really liked these headphones when they were working. After about three months though, the right earbud stopped working. For eleven dollars, these were a great buy for me. Highly recommended.                    Considering the price, it is great! Bass is awesome, and if you listen to rap and such, like I do, then this is great. Highs might be a little tone downed, but for the price its great! I was worried it might look a little bulky, but that's not the case. And they are a great fit. L shaped plug is also great.Overall a great buy!                    I have an older pair of Sony earbuds (don't know the model) and they are probably 7 years old. I can remember the first time I put them in. I was completely blown away at the sound and the bass. I still do not understand how all the sound comes from the tiny hole in the unit. I decided I would upgrade. I did not know that some of these earbuds could go $300-$400 and up. I decided on the MDR-EX210 and I got them for what I thought was a great price. Again I am blown away by the sound and the bass. They are not a dramatic improvement from my old ones but well worth it for the price. They fit comfortably in the ear and I can wear them all day without any problems. Way to go Sony!                    I purchased these because they were at a great price and I needed a new pair of headphones. the sound is pretty good, but I am not too picky when it  comes to sound. they def. sound better than the other ones I have. The one thing I like about these is that they don't hurt my ear canal. I can leave them in for a long time with out them bothering my ears. also, they do not fall out. they also come with a bag to store them and a bunch of different sized ends. overall, I was satisfied with them.                    I am going to start off by saying that people expect way too much for the amount they pay. They pay $15-$20 and expect to have $300 sounding headphones HA!. let me begin by saying for the value this product is amazing. I did read the articles about the thin wire and it feeling "cheap", and I will say that it is a very thin cheap feeling wire HOWEVER this has been a PLUS for me because I have been able to workout with these headphones while I lift weights (bench press, rows ect) and I noticed that since the wire is thinner it sits against my chest easier, and it does NOT swing from side to side getting in my way. I LOVE THAT.I will also note that I have the Kilpsh s4 in ear headphones and these headphones are almost similar in sound quality (klipsh being a little bit better)HOWEVER if you have an android phone you can go to the app store and download a music player that has a equalizer, and this can make almost ANY HEADPHONES sound AMAZING (when you play around with it) I am currently using power amp from the app store its like $4These have been my favorite pair of headphones thus far because its great for me at the gym, whether i'm on the elliptical, or on the bike, it sits good and doesnt swing a ton, and it does not get in my way when I lift weights.It does come with extra ear buds and a cheap feeling small velvet bag case, however they protect the headphones great. I love these headphones and I would totally recommend getting them to anyone, using these with a music player app that has a equalizer will make them even more amazing. Give it a shot and see how you like it. I was skeptical at first but i'm happy I made the choice and got these = )                    Deep bass for in ear headphones. Cup style effectively mutes the sound of the subway - also great on airplanes. In fact, some might find that they mute surroundings a little too much for just walking around.
!###I owned a pair of Sony's MDR-EX300s for several years until one of the earpieces broke down - they were my daily beater pair, always wrapped up and in my pocket for years, so not a big surprise. I loved their sound quality and looked hard for a replacement.I subsequently purchased the Apple in-ear earphones, a pair of Earpods, and one of the Scosche models (115 I think). I actually like the sound of the Earpods the best (very balanced with good bass in my opinion), but wanted an in-ear model for the gym. The Sony MDR-EX210s fit the bill for that.The 210s have a much stronger bass compared to the older 300, and much much more than the Apple IEMs. The bass comes across as a little strong to me, but is perfect for workout music. It's a thumping and tight kind of bass. Given that the 210s are a third of the price of the 300s, I consider them a great deal.The only cons are that the 210s don't have a mic (I wish there was a reasonably priced model with a mic so I could use it with my phone), and the cord feels cheaper than the other earphones I own.For the price they are hard to beat.                    Not only do I have very little to nor trouble keeping them in my ear (as long as I cleaned my ears daily), they were super comfortable and would completely forget that they were even there sometimes. I'm not a big audio freak but I must say, for the price, the audio is pretty amazing!                    For inexpensive ear buds, these have good bass and fit well in my ears.  No complaints with these little guys.                    The sound is crisp and clear. I use these earphones for everything and they keep up with me. I had a few other competitor branded headphones of higher quality that did not last as long, so i highly recomend these.                    They came on time. They sound good, especially the bass. Like most reviewers, I found that the cable is thin. It doesn't affect the sound quality, but I'm not sure about the build quality. They still sound very good though and they are inexpensive.                    For the price, this is a great set of earbuds. The noise isolation is much better than the cheaper Sony MDREX10LP/BLK, and the bass is also quite booming. I've tried other brands before, including Phillips and SkullCandy, and their idea of bass is pretty pitiful compared to most Sony earbuds. That being said, I will see how long these MDR EX210B/BLU pair lasts me, as the longevity of earbuds does not typically surpass a year (at least for me!). Ultimately, I would compare the sound to these: http://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB40EX-Sensitivity-Driver-Earbuds/dp/B001RB24U0/ref=sr_1_94?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1366055359&sr=1-94&keywords=sony+earbuds+bass(Sony MDR-XB40EX High Sensitivity Driver Extra Bass EX Earbuds - 13.5mm) but these have been discontinued I believe, and the price of these EX210B's is quite sensible.Pros:Comfortable, secure fit in earsStrong bass and clear trebleCons:None so far                    Low price and high sound quality. But my ear is a little uncomfortable if I use it for a long time.                    Great deep base!!!  I love them they are comfortable and I wear this for long periods of time at work.  Sony has always made a great product and didn&#8217;t fall short on this one at all.                    Like the price and the fit. Has a bit more of outside noise than I am use to however very comfortable.                    I find that many kinds of earphones are uncomfortable and was very pleased with the feel of these.The sound quality is fabulous!
!###Of the 20+ earbud with mic that I've bought, this is the best in its class. Excellent sound. All parts work well. For me, the deal-maker is the right-angle connection to the iPhone. In all my searches, it seems that most earphone makers don't notice that straight-line connector to iPhone is bad design. The right angle works, makes sense for busy people who live the iPhone lifestyle. I wouldn't go anywhere without my beloved talk podcasts (NPR et al) AND receive all phone calls. I've done the research. This is the model that does it all.The only thing short of perfection is: I wish they would make it in flat-wire style, to lessen the tangle factor.                    Wow I bought these to replace my SoundSquared sport headphones. The wire is cheap looking but the quality of the sound will make you say whatever just like I did. I mean seriously if you have to have flashy wires get something else but the quality won't be a close to these. Save yourself the trouble and get these!                    first i'll let you know that i've never tried one of those $500+ ear buds. But having enough experience with regular ones, i can easily recommend these. to me bass is superb and highs are satisfactory.                    I have loved these since day one!Sound:The sound quality is great.  Strong presence of bass for ear buds (thanks to the large 13.5 mm drivers).  Great highs and wholesome mids.  I have used Apple, Bose, Klipsch, Sony, audio-technica, and many other headphones over the years.  The sound is crisp, full, and balanced.Comfort:These are very comfortable.  The first day I got them, I logged about 3 hours of almost continuous usage.  They come with 3 sets of ear bud pads (small, medium, large) to fit a wide range of ear sizes.  They are very light, do not apply excessive pressure, and fit snugly.Additional Features:These come with a little bag to keep them in.  This provides some level of organization and protection, as well as keeping dust out of the buds.  There is also a coil clip for wrapping excess cord.All-in-all, one would be hard pressed to find a superior ear-bud in sound quality, features, and build quality at this price range (and possibly double) from my experience.I have been a fan of Sony ear buds for years due to their quality and performance, and this set is my favorite by far!                    A GREAT CHOICE for documentaries and audio books--I really like the slightly reduced treble/sibilance of these Sony earbuds.Very good value for the price.  They live up to the bass claims, maybe even a bit excessive bass response for all-around music use.I know I'll buy another pair when I lose or damage these.  And I will...                    Beautiful sound, nice design as expected from  Sony MDR line. Only flaw is a weak cord. A braided cord would have been to much to ask for I guess.                    i bought these for a 10 hour plane ride to london and they did the trick. They are super loud, hit real nice..I love music of all kinds, from Michael Jackson to Metallica to Mac Miller  and everything in between.These work great for all types of music.These and a pair of bluetooth over-the-ear cheap headphones (Kinivo BTH240) beat out the ATH-M50's for me.Just i guess because of my lifestyle i was happier with this and a pair of bluetooth than a huge bulky set of headphones where i had to take of my phone case just to plug it in my phone.Bottom line: great earbuds for the price.                    I'm listening to music on these babies right now. Great quality. Beats my 'around the ear' incase headphones. They feel like I could wear them for a long time, and I have. They stick out a bit, but it doesn't matter, the music sounds way too good to care about people's pretentious judgements about my dance moves.                    I go through headphone earbuds like candy -- I lose them, they break. This pair has lasted for at least five months - and that's with me moving across the world twice. Sony delivers fantastic sound and the color is a sophisticated blue.                    These earbuds have great sound quality for a $20-$30 price tag!  They are comfortable enough to wear for several hours at a time (at the office, on plane, etc.).  They also do a pretty impressive job of blocking out background noise.  The travel pouch is a nice bonus.The only complaint I have about these earbuds is that the cord is really thin and feels kind of cheap.  My older pair of Sony earbuds that came with an MP3-player have much thicker rubber around the cords and feels sturdier.  I'm a little worried that these ones are going to get damaged.  I don't recommend getting these earbuds for use during exercise.
!###Before I go any further I must say that the real test of quality when it comes to something like earbud headphones is time.  If the buds don't last for very long, then don't bother with them.  A good example is every set of Skull Candy buds that I have ever owned (most of which broke down within six months, including one pair that stopped working after two weeks) compared to a cheap pair of semi-uncomfortable earbuds that I bought at a gas station (which to this day still work).  Skull Candy prided themselves on the quality of the sound they produced, which was indeed excellent, but having them break down so often completely outweighs any other advantage because you know it won't be long before you need to spend another $20-$40 for a new pair.  The earbuds I bought at the gas station can't be said to produce the best quality sound, but they did not produce poor quality, and they still work.  I could live with whatever foibles those headphones had, at least up until the time I decided to find something that would both have good sound and would not be uncomfortable.That said, that was why I chose Sony earbuds over any other brand.  This is my third set of Sony earbuds; the first was a small set that I got at Walmart for around 20 dollars, which lasted longer than any Skull Candy buds I had ever bought and produced sound of a comparable quality.  The next set was a neck-chain style of earbuds which I only stopped using because I lost one of the ear cushions in a minor accident; they were working perfectly until then and were the most comfortable I had ever owned because they were neck-chain style.  To clarify, a neck-chain style is one where the cord for the right bud is much longer than the one for the left ear; that lets you drape the cord around your neck, so that if you need to take out the buds for any reason you can leave them hanging over your shoulder as opposed to having to put them away to keep them from falling or damaged, etc.And truth be told, if I had been able to find neck-chain style earbuds I would have bought those.  I bought these because the product description said they would be neck-chain style.  The product description lied, and they turned out to be Y-cord.  But, that is the only problem I have had with these buds so far.  There was a minor issue at the beginning due to the size of the buds; when you put them in you can feel them hitting the side of the ear because they are so long.  But I could tell that they are designed like that so that they go straight into the ear.  That translates into better sound quality in exchange for something that is not so much uncomfortable as it is unusual.  And, being Sony buds, they continue to work up to the present time.The moral of the story, or morals really, are that Sony buds are a better value product (they last longer, and the sound quality is just as good as any other product) and that the cheapest was is not the best (these buds cost around $40, but you do actually get $40 quality).  So I would definitely buy these again, provided I could not find any neck-chain style cords first.                    To be honest, I bought these headphones because they were so cheap ($14.95 for the blue pair).  I felt good about the purchase because of the favorable reviews.  However, you get what you pay for.  If I breath too deeply these fall out my ears.  I have tried all three sizes of buds, nothing works. Perhaps this is how buds work, but I will never buy buds again.  Not for me.The sound is alright, nothing special.  Again, for $15 what do you expect.  What I dislike most is the lack of bass.  The sound is clear, but not much else.                    sound is decent.  product says neck chain so i was expecting J cord, but it came with Y cord.  i want to return but threw away packaging                    I purchased this headset as a back up pair for my more expensive headset.  The sound and quality are good for the money.  They aren't the quality of my higher priced headphones but the sound is still good.                    These earbuds did not meet my expectations. They do not have a very full, rich sound and they lacked bass. Don't know where all the 5 star reviews come from. I have bought a number of earbuds based on reviews that just don't match my experience. I gave 3 stars because they were better than some I've purchased but I would not say I was satisfied with them.                    I purchased these headphones to use while running.  The sound is fine, but I cannot get them to stay in my ears while doing anything active.  This is the first set of earbuds that I've had this type of issue with.  I've tried changing the sizes of the earbuds, etc., but nothing seems to work.                    After a mere EIGHT attempts to find ears buds that would not fall out of my ears every time I turned my head, didn't make my ears ache after fifteen minutes of use and had great sound I was sure that they existed only in the land of Unicorns and Leprechauns. I don't know why I thought the ninth time would be a charm but it was! These buds stay put, don't hurt and sound fantastic. Now off to find that pot o' gold...                    The audio quality of the set of these that I received promptly, packaged nicely, is abysmal IMHO.There is virtually NO treble, and the response in voice ranges is very subdued. Lots of base, little else.The overall effect is muddy, underwaterish mush.I tried them on classical, country and jazz, and then gave up and switched to a set ofthe standard Apple earbuds that came with my new Classic iPod.The Apple product is a little better, but short of spending a lot more money in hopes of finding a propersound in the earbud class, I switched to my 10 year old, heavily used MDR V6 earphones.Unless you insist on a set of tiny in ear buds, and are able to try some before buying, I recommendbiting the bullet and finding a set of the MDR V6, over the ear phones. Yes, they cost a lot more.If you like HIFI sound matched to the quality you can get from iPODs or other portable sources, try the MDR V6.They collapse unto a very small cubic content, are equipped with a very generous length of heavy duty,coiled cord, and mine came with a very nice leather feel, pull cord carrying bag.The foam liner which bears on your ear is currently, readily available for replacement.My first liner set lasted about eight years of heavy use, including air travel, use on dvd players, computeraudio, and four different iPOD models.I need to set the volume level of my new Classic at about 80% level, whereasthe buds I tried are adequate in volume at about 50%.I suppose that indicates a somewhat higher battery drain, but the superb sound of the MDR V6 is worth it.Don't waste your money on these little buds. Get a real set of phones. Sennheiser also makes some very inexpensivephones that all provide much better, balanced audio than these little buds. Physics wins out.                    The wiring on these is really my only problem. They feel cheap, look cheap, and dangle around all over my body when I have them in. for $25 though it is a steal. The sound quality is very nice and crisp. I would highly reccomend these to anyone looking for a bargain.                    Nice ear phones for the price!  Very nice color and very comfortable on the ear, and the sounds is excellent!I would by any Sony Headphones!
!###It was a typical Summer day. As I finished stretching for my run, I grabbed my older Sony extra bass earbuds. A few minutes into the run, something unthinkable happened: sound stopped coming out of one of the earbuds. Thinking it was just my phone acting funny, I unplugged the headphones, and tried again. Unfortunately, nothing changed. Since my Sony extra bass earbuds had lasted for nearly three years with almost daily use, I assumed that the headphone jack was going out in my phone. Turns out, it was the headphones.I tried looking for my same pair of earbuds, but quickly realized they were discontinued, and the ones that were selling on Amazon were going for far more than what I originally paid. Since I had to run to the store anyway that day, I ended up just grabbing a pair of "lifetime warranty" earbuds for 10 bucks at Walmart. Let's just say I regretted that decision, and it wasn't three weeks until they met the same fate as my now deceased Sonys.At this point, I grabbed my credit card, hopped on Amazon, and found these newer generation extra bass earbuds from Sony. Same 13.5mm driver, just a different design. One month later, and they're everything I'd remembered. The sound is great, the bass is top notch, and I barely have to adjust them while working out. People often think extra bass earbuds are good for, well, just that, but these Sonys pick up all the subtle nuances as well.                    Bought two of these about 4 months ago, both have held up well so far.  I use them in my car and when sitting at work.  I'm pretty sure they will fall out of your ear if used during a work out.  Sound quality is good.  Bass is surprisingly good for a small pair of ear buds.                    It was finefor the first 20 days.Then the earphone intermittently malfunction. Sometimes there is no sound coming out.                    I had a prior pair of Sony IEM ("ROCKIN' LITTLE BUDS"! Wow, Sony marketing is pretty lame...) and really liked their sound.But eventually the cord fell apart near the bud on the old pair. In the interim, I tried another brand, but always liked the Sony sound signature and stage.These came highly recommended on some headphone review sites, and at around 20 bucks, why not?Really like the sound: good strong bass, but not thudding/distorted; midrange is clear and highs are also.  Feels like you're in the studio with the artist when using these - very immediate presentation of the music.What's also great about this pair is their noise cancelling ability -- put that down to a great seal when they are in the ear. I personally like the "disc" like design because I can hold that as I insert them into my ears for a good, snug fit.I've used these on plane rides and they REALLY work well - even though they are not active noise cancelling IEMs, they do a great job of blocking out the sound!My only complaint about these (and Sony IEMs in general) are the cords: they are cheap feeling and just do not last - this is the weak link in Sony's design -- and who knows, maybe that's Sony's plan so they'll sell more units.  The cord construction is just flimsy and if I get 2 years out of these, that will be enough for $20.                    I got them for $17 which you just can't complain about for these. Yeah, I'd be enraged if I paid that much for a pair of the old Apple ones but these have good enough sound quality and stay in my ears...well enough. I was a bit reluctant to get headphones (for running) that don't have the loop over your ear but these do just fine. Yeah, I occasionally have to push them back in but that happened with my old ones that did have the loop. Granted, maybe all I buy is crap. I was happy with the bass and the cord is a good length. Some might argue that it's too long for running but I like the extra slack so I can hold it in one hand without yanking them out of my ears.Just as a heads up, they're pretty much noise-producing ear plugs. You can't hear anything around you when these are in which is good in some scenarios and bad in others. Also, the cord does kind of make a lot of noise. But I don't own 60 pairs of headphones so I don't really know how that compares to others.                    Moderate use (two hours or so a day) -- as the title says, the left earbud died after 2 months                    For the prices I am very pleased with the quality. If I have to buy again will not hesitate.Appearance is good.                    I bought this item this March and when I received them they worked great but after 5 months of heavy usage the left headphone started to go bad, it still works only when I adjust the cable. I would recommend this product for those who use it lightly but for those who would use it every day hours at a time I would say to get a better pair, even if it costs you a little more money.                    Better than what i expected. It also came with a pouch which could help the earphone last longer. Sound quality was up to standard.                    Great price, super base, excellent fit. I recommend these for every use - in the gym, on the trail, working at home.
!###Lost the factory headphones and based on reviews, bought these.  So far everything sounds great, from les miserables to oingo boingo                    I was fortunate to find these on my Amazon Specials, so I was able to get them for 1/2 price.  Had I known how comfortable, and how incredible the sound is through them I would have been more than willing to pay full price for them.  These are by far the best earbuds I've ever had.Service was prompt, well packaged, arrived on time and in good order, what more could a person want?  :)I will certainly do business with this merchant again!                    I purchased the MDR-EX210B to replace the MDR-EX083 which came with my Walkman. There's no two ways about it, this earbud MORE than produced the sound you'd want them to do. You want bass? Look no further. Clarity of mid's and high's? This is certainly the earbud for you. The reason I gave them such a low score is for people like me who must walk or take public transportation everywhere, it is important the unit stays in your ear. The sound was so good I tried everything, but nothing worked. Maybe someday Sony will include an over-the-ear clip to hold them in place so I can give them 5 stars! Another help would be an anti-tangle cord. When time is of the essence to catch a bus, you haven't got time to fiddle around trying to untangle the cord for such extraordinary sound. What a waste. My friend bought these others instead. They seem to do the trick, so I'll try them next. My advice to you is to go with them the first time around Sony MDRXB60EX/GLD Extra Bass In Ear 13.5mm Driver Headphone, Gold.                    just unboxed and tried on three of my digital devices and without ANY burn-in time sounds fantastic! Well worth the $14 I paid!!! I will let you all know how they sound after I burn them in for 30hrs.  Wires could be a bit thicker, I've got an old pair of JLab J2's and they are the most substantial cables I've ever had on earbuds, none before and none since!. Nontheless these fit well and seem to be a great value.3/22/13 Update: I'm rocking out to Fleetwood Mac which has a very dynamic sound as I write this and all I can say is WOW, the crisp highs, snares and defined mids are outstanding, the spatial separation is accurate and the base is quick and tight but booming. These were available in both blue and black when I ordered but the blue were $15 and black almost $10 more [??] Since the color does not affect the spec's I opted to save the extra $. I noticed the price has jumped up a bit more since then. At a major retailer these are $39. Still wish the cables were thicker but I'm reaching to find any con's so far.                    I don't normally rate the products that I buy just because I am too lazy to do that. But this one product has made me put aside all the laziness just coz of the sheer quality of sound it generates. I am no expert but these headphones have just blown me away. Never bought any headphones like these and I don't think will ever for such low price. These are better than the brands priced way above $25. This is what I call "cheap n Best".                    I saw the reviews and expected a lot from this headphones. I will not say I was disappointed, but not too happy either. The sound quality is pretty good. Somehow I feel the wow factor missing. But for the cost its a good buy...                    Sound is okay. But it does not stay in my ears at all. I've tried all the sizes, and I haven't had this problem with other in-ear buds. Going to buy something more high quality.                    i bought it at $15,and the sound quality is pretty good,the wires are goo as well.best headphone for the price.                    for the price they are great,  base is good, I usually get a few cheap ear bud for travel, I did not expect these to sound this good.                    Bought these to use for jogging, gym workouts, etc.They don't stay in the ears if you're moving around constantly.Aside from that, the sound quality isn't noticeably better than the $10 Panasonic ear buds or the $15 JVC marshmallow ear buds.Of the 3, the JVCs had the most defined bass sound, and the Panasonics had the most ringing, clear highs.These were in the middle on both counts.  The thin wires kind of irked me as well, as it seemed that they got tangled up easier than the thick JVC wires, and were more difficult to untangle.
!###Love these headphones! Sony always seems to make some of the best affordable audio equipment that is comparable to gear that would costs twice as much from others; these headphones are no exception.                    Testing out these earbuds. I go through them pretty quick so the build quality is usually the only issue with Sony headphones and earbuds. So far the sound quality is as expected. Very rich bass and treble is good too. I almost find that there is too much bass but soon I'll get used to it. I don't have the sound up too much on my ZUNE HD to hear the music clearly. I do see that the wiring looks kinda flimsy and the connectors that lead into the earbuds themselves I worry about breaking. If you're rough with your earbuds like I am then this may turn out to be a breaking point. If not then they should last a year or longer. Sounds wonderful though!                    I bought these earphones seeking and expecting excellent quality. I chose Sony because I know them for their quality, and I wasn't disappointed. These earphones are worth the money I spent on it.The cables are long and sturdy - my PC requires audio outputs to be plugged into the rear port, and these are long enough to reach from back there (although I have my PC laid down on its side for better airflow). The sound is crisp and clear, and the bass is rich and full. From listening to Michael Jackson, to playing Skyrim, I'm getting great immersion.Sony products are often expensive, but they are often worth every cent.                    The Sony MDR-EX210BLK was a great purchase for the $28 that Amazon had it for. I compared it to my friend's in ear Beats (which was $130) and you had to do multiple comparisons to detect the difference! The sound quality is not only clean (and flat), but as loud as the beats! The cable is very thin, so it would not be practical for teens, and the noise canceling effect is good. Good value for money!                    I am not particular about headphones and therefore don't look to pay much and find Sony is reliable. Sound quality on these is fine but the shape of the earbud is just bizarre. The round portion with the logo creates an odd fit. I do not recommend this style.                    I bought these to use when working out.  The product is a disappointment and waste of money.  The headphones feel comfortable enough, but the sound quality is zero.  The cord length is on the short side.  I should have known, as a general rule, you do get what you pay for.                    These are comparable to the cheap, low quality earbuds one could find at a local Walgreens. They have so much bass the sound is distorted, the wire is very thin gauge causing it to tangle easily and none of the silicone ear buds fit well and they need constant adjusting. Go with the Pioneer earbuds for a few more dollars. These are horrendous.                    Very satisfied with these headphones. The sound is rich, deep and clear for the price that I paid, I could not have asked for higher sound quality and higher build quality. I'm not sure how long they will last, but I don't use them every day, so I hope they last for years. I might lose them before they stop working. They come with a little tray attached to the cable which allows the unused length of the cable to be wrapped around it.                    So I have owned, and still do, headphones costing $400 or more. I decided to grab a pair of these phones for kicks, mainly to see how they sounded and to eventually give them away to a friend or relative who is trying to improve from stock iBuds or Earpods (the earpods sound decent enough, but I can't get them to fit my ears). So I plug them into my iPod Shuffle, not bad out of the box. Switch over to the Clip+ to see if I can EQ the highs a bit, and sure enough, a little tweaking brought out the treble, much crisper (I am not an EQ snob, I just listen and decide if I like the enhancement or not). I have to say, $16 for these IEMs is a fantastic deal for anyone looking for a great price to performance IEM and knows how to wear an in-ear phone. Some people posted that they fall out or there is no bass? That is a clear sign they are not inserting them properly to get a good seal. These are not buds, they do not rest in the ear canal. They need to be jammed in with the right size tip to get a seal. Otherwise, no matter what phone you buy that is not over the ear, you will not get the sound they were meant to produce.I can only say with 20 minutes of listening (have the Underture from Tommy playing right now), these phones are an excellent value purchase. And I don't mean they sound okay for the money. For $16, they are competitive with phones costing $100 in my view. I have been down the buying and trying road for a long time, a decade, and frankly I am starting to believe that the low budget IEMs out there, including this one, are starting to offer the best value. No, they are not my $400 customs, which do indeed deliver a richer, more dymamic sound. But $16 vs. $400? Owning those expensive phones is nice, but if I had to go back to my under $60 collection (this phone, Sony MH1C, Apple ADDIEM), I would not be terribly upset.Highly recommended as a workout, walkabout phone. And perfect for kids, since you can buy 3-4 pair and keep them for the inevitable loss/destruction. However, to reach their potential, EQ is necessary.                    The bass is so loud. You cant hear the singing on a iphone. but its better on a computer.On a iphone 2 starsOn a computer 4 stars
!###I was looking for some decent earphones to wear for an extended period of time and not have to worry about loosing or breaking them since they would be cheap, I'm sure that for many people $16 is not a small fortune. So I started reading users reviews about most of the earphones here on amazon. I read reviews from the Shure SE530s which I also own and for earphones they do cost a small fortune, to the cheapest 3 dollars earphones you can buy also here on amazon. Then I felt curious about these sonys since they are so well reviewed and also they cost so little, so if I buy them and I loose them or break them, I won't be loosing almost $500 like in the Shure's case which I was always concerned about. Well I am glad a gave these a try. Boy these earphones can reproduce all very high & low frequencies like champs, their sound compares and can very easily compete with the Shures that cost $500 in both clarity and power, I love when you can crank up the volume and the speakers or the earphones won't distort the music. And these are the case, no distortion at all, and if you want powerful bass, even more than the shures can deliver, highs too, then you have a very cheap and simple solution. I can't be any happier with this purchase. so I recommend them as a very good solution and at a more than reasonable price.Unlike many reviewers, I'm not a sound "engineer or expert", but I do am a musician, percussionist, and I can tell the difference when headphones sound well and reproduce frequencies better than others. I'm very picky about sound and when I listen to music.After this purchase, I see no reason at all, to but headphones that cost even $20, unless they increase the price on these sonys of course.                    I got these in the mail couple days after I ordered.  Nice and speedyMain purpose was to replace my lost earbuds I had for working out at the gym.I used them for the first time at the gym and was pleasantlyl surprised.  They worked great!- The ear buds felt very snug and confortable in my ears. (almost forgot they were in there...and your ears dont hurt after long use)  They were snug enough to pretty much cancel out the noise in the gym.  My gym is pretty loud with the machines clinking away and they always blast loud music that I dont really care for.  My new earbuds helped almost cancel the backgroud noise completely.- Then I turned on my Ipod and the sound quality was quite impressive.  I could actually hear the bass which I never noticed on my old earbuds.  They sound was great for what the earbuds cost.  If you want really really good sound...you are bound to cough up $200 ~ $300 for a pair...and even then, I doubt they would be that good over these buds.  Might as well get the full earphones that wrap around your ear like the Boss.Anyhow, these earbuds are great and they serve thier purpose for me in the gym.  Not afraid to get them roughed up as the cost is pretty cheap to replace if I break them by mistake.I would recommend if you are looking for a comfortable, good quality earbuds.Cheers!                    Bought as a gift for my son as a Christmas present (2012)... and so far he has not complained... so that is a good thing. He researched and picked out this model of ear-buds, so it is what I ordered. So far so good!!!  The price was right and he is happy... so I am happy!!!                    These earbuds sound fantastic. Crystal clear across bass, mid-range and treble, with a very satisfying dose of bass. I usually listen to bass-heavy funk music, and these buds are very well suited to that genre, with clean, round bottom and punchy mid-lows. My prior favorites were VMODA bass freq's and Sony MDR-EX71's. While the bass freq's might have a bit more bottom, these 210's have much more clarity in the lows and mid-lows. You *feel* a bit more bottom with the bass freq's, but you *hear* more bottom with these Sonys. In side by side comparison, the bass freq's sound muddy as compared to these 210's. I no longer have the Sony 71's, but back when I had both the 71's and the bass freq's, I found the 71's put too much emphasis on the treble and not enough on the bass, so for daily use, I chose the bass freq's, Now I have 210's and bass freq's and the decision is easy; I will be exclusively using the Sony 210's. Example songs used for comparison between these 210's and the bass freqs: Marcus Miller Power Of Soul, Reddings The Awakening, George Clinton Atomic Dog, Graham Central Station Water & Hair, and Juvenile 4 Minutes. In all cases, the 210's sounded far better than the bass freqs. Highly recommended.More info: I've had the EX210's for 5 months now, and still recommend them just as highly. Today I got the Sony MDR-XB600 (full sized extended bass) headphones. I compared them to the EX210's using the same music as listed above. You can read my full comparison in the review for the XB600's, but here's the short version: The EX210's get 5 stars while the XB600's get 4 stars. Attached to my phone, the XB600's deliver only marginally better bass than the EX210's, and only deliver 2/3 of the volume. Attached to an amp, the XB600's are around 30% better than the XB210's as they deliver even more bottom than the EX210's, with similar overall clarity. Unless you catch a crazy good Amazon Lightning Deal (as I did), the XB600's cost 3 or 4 times as much as the EX210s, and are much less portable. Summary: The EX210's are a MUCH better value - actually the 210's are a SHOCKINGLY GREAT value!                    Bought this for my son and he uses it everyday and said it is the best he ever used and he loves it.                    Pros: Excellent noise cancelling, very comfortable to keep in ears for long periods.Cons: Too much packaging. Could be far less.                    I've tried just about all the decent budget iem's. This pair isn't half bad. The 3 stars id where they fall, average.A few years ago, this set would be among the finest offered for the price. Too manyoptions these days.The build could be better, nothing too bad. My biggest gripe is the thickness of notes. These sound very similar to the Skullcandy Ink'd 2. If you like heavy bass and recessed mids, these will suit you. Many people prefer that sound signature. No boosted treble, just boosted bass. The Skullcandy actually seem better build wise.Detail is barely average, but poor source material is slightly forgiven. If you're using low bit rate files, it won't really matter.  If you want great sound, I'd try to step into the 60 dollar range, where the laws of diminishing returns starts to kick in.                    If you are a fan of bass, these are great. They will thump your head like a boss. The small extension on the earbuds are the bass generator. These also make adjusting them to fit in your ear simple. These stay in your ear by the snug fit of the earbud in your ear canal. Thus, it is important to use the included earbud rubber fittings to create a snug fit in your ear. You may want to use a q-tip beforehand to prevent these from slipping out of your year. Once you fit these properly, these will fit snugly and comfortably in your ears for hours. I also purchases the cheaper Sony earbuds, and they rely on the curves of your ear to hold them in, and after a few hours, it can cause some discomfort. The fit on these is worth the extra $15 upgrade.I like to listen to a wide range of sounds, and I enjoyed the deep bass, and also high-end handling of these earbuds. For what you pay for these earbuds, you are getting a nice quality sound. My only con is that they still used the thin wires on these, which makes me fear getting them caught on anything.                    These are fantastic and a great value. I listen to music and audiobooks all the time while traveling and exercising. I'm not willing to pay a lot either. These sound great, feel great and even come with a cloth case. I couldn't have asked for more.                    Not comfortable to ears .. The logo is fading out and wires are always tangling together . Won't recommend .
!###The sound is very good and bass is strong (maybe a bit stronger than I was hoping for) -- but that's all fine. My main disappointment is the cheap looking cord that is connected to the nice looking earbud.  It looks and feels like it is a $0.50 cent wire connected to a $30-$50 earbud.  Wish they could have chosen a better cord material.                    Everything, everyone else has said that was good about these was true:You literally hear new notes when you listen to your music with these headphones cus they are just that good.The range is the widest I have ever seen in headphones yet.They slip in flat into the ear, which was a little awkward for me but meh I really don't mind(as opposed to the sony headphones that kind of curve into the ear like these: [...]catalogId=10551&storeId=10151&langId=-1&productId=8198552921665370693)They also give a little instruction booklet with how to take care of them. (didn't know u cud wash earbuds in a solution)It comes with a dandy winder that I figured out how to use. You'll have to play with it. But I do recommend it, as does the little booklet, because it protects teh buds and jack if used correctly(see instructions)Amazing new musical experiences thanks to these&lt;3                    great sound.  use for new ipad with splitter.  bought two pair for movie watching on ipad. work great.  cute storage pouch. excellent bass.                    I'm really glad I discovered these earbuds. I've been frustrated with the poor durability and mediocre sound of earbuds that cost just a tiny bit less. These are an amazing value for the price. The larger headers really do deliver stronger, deeper sound than you get from cheaper earbuds, and the quality throughout is very solid for the price point. I'm a big fan.                    I use these all day at work and they are by far the best headphones by far, great sound, deep base, very clear, super comfortable, I would definitely buy these again.  Kicks my $80 Bose out of the water, literately.                    Great sound quality and they didn't hurt the ears after a long period of time. They fit perfectly and I have been enjoying them since I bought them. Good buy!                    Sound quality is superb.  Sound isolation is effective for a passive design.  The silicon earplugs are comfortable but the whole earphone is rather large and tends to slip out of place after 10-20 minutes of wearing.  I tried using larger pads but that didn't fit right.  So I have to push these back into my ears every so often.  I only listen for 20 minutes at a time while on the bus so this is not a big issue.  If I was wearing these for hours I would likely get frustrated.                    This headphone is really awesome. Its sound is so excellent with deep bass and very clear. It also looks really modern and nice, and its comfortable to put in my ears.                    positive: pretty loud and pretty good quality.negative: they dont stay in my ear very well so running with them is a pain.                    I got these headphones 5 years ago, and the sound is incredible to this day.  If you are consider these headphones, put them near the top of the list.  I've listened to so many different in-ear buds and none are as crisp as these.  Great value.
!###I have an addiction. I admit it. When I see headphones go up on lightning deals I instinctively hit buy. I have owned at least a dozen earbuds over the past few years. Everything from $5-$115. I am active and use these at the gym daily. I don't do cardio but sweat a ton when I work out. Before I even get into pros/cons let me tell you that these are the first pair to last 3 months without issue. No fading, no one ear out, nothing!Lets start:Pros:DURABILITY - As I said these are the first to last 3 months of daily sweating11/22/2013 update - 6 Months with no sound degradation. The hole in my heart that Sony has created is one that can never be filled. The days of rationalizing impulse headphone purchases are over. No longer will I feel the smooth lining of an unopened package of headphones. The thrill of the unknown, which is to say the inopportune times in which one ear would suddenly cut out mid workout. Sony has taken the fun of online shopping from me by making these headphones perfect. I guess i'll have to find another impulse purchase hobby.Cons:Appearance - Its no Giant B on your ear, but the disc that sticks out is ugly.Thoughts:I was not happy with these when I first purchased them. They sound better than JLab but not as good as Kplish S4I's. There is no over abundance of base, actually it is lacking a little. When turned all the way up the Bass under performs.Consistency is key here. I beat these things up and I'm confident in them every time I grab them and head to the gym. I've learned not to rate products on Sound quality alone. I've also learned to wait a few months before praising a product. How many times do people pick up their JLab headphones say "THESE THINGS ARE GREAT!" write a review and then 3 weeks later they break. How many of those people come back here and change their review? P.S. I was a faithful JLab customer until they messed me over on a pair of defective buds twice.There is absolutely nothing worse than showing up ready to lift with one earbud out and have Taylor Swifts terrible voice seep in from the broken ear. If you want headphones that last, go with Sony.Update: 8/18/2013They still sound exactly the same as when I first purchased them. No distortion, no partial loss of volume. Great quality!Update 11/22/2013Not a bit of sound degradation. Who will give up first, my headphones or gym regimen. Star upgrade from 4 to 5. I have never had a pair last this long under such strenuous conditions. I'm treating this review like a relationship, we have hit the 6 month mark so no more celebrations until our one year anniversary. If they should break before that time you can be assured that I will make an update, however if things are still lady and the tramp well then I expect to update you all in 6 months.Feel free to ask any questions below. Happy shopping!                    Sony MDR-EX210B $25Philips SHE6000 $18Klipsch IMAGE S4 $69Sony MDR-ED12LP  $12JVC HAFX1X vs  $18Etymotic ER23-HF3 $100Winner: Sony MDR-EX210BI have been listening to a lot of EDM, House, and Trance lately. I needed something with good bass. Not just muffled loud bass, but clear bass. I also of course I also wanted crystal clear mid's and high's.I tested all headphones with popular song "Walls" by Ned Shepard & Tiesto. In the first few seconds of the song there is a thundering bass that fades. Sony MDR-EX210B was the only headphone that allowed me to distinguish between the different bass notes and it felt thundering in an enclosed space like in a movie theater or at a rave right in front of the speakers, but yet was still crystal clear. 5 stars on comfort as well. Thanks Sony, you've still got it!                    I have used a lot of different headphones.  Bose, Klipsh, Sony, Panasonic...etc.  These Sony earbuds, for around $30, offer the best value by far.  I have used mine for only about two weeks so I can't speak to durability but the range they deliver is superior to most other earbud style headphones I have tried. They come with three different sizes (for the ear piece).  The middle ones fit my ears perfectly and don't slip when I'm working out (mainly running).  Terrific bass and crisp treble.  The only other headphones I have tried that are comparable cost around $100.                    I paid about $20 at Walmart for these, but after owning them for some three years, I would gladly pay the $49 here to replace them. They show no signs of breaking or wearing out, however, and their sound quality is just as good as ever. They produce strong bass and mids with no compromise in clarity. (As a bass player of seven years, I appreciate this more than most.) The muffled - too much mids - sound found in standard I-pod headphones is nonexistent, and the piercing - too much highs - sound found in others is not there either. These headphones maintain a perfect balance of sound throughout all kinds of music. They are also more comfortable than any other pair of headphones I have ever worn. It is possible to listen for hours without any discomfort so long as I am wearing the right size earpiece. (They give you three: small, medium, and large. I use small.)                    I'm not really an Audiophile,  but I play the Piano,  Guitar and Cello, so i know if something is out of tune or not right. Sony is known for their sound engineering throughout the years and I was kinda skeptical becuase of the price,  but to be staight forward, These Earphones are comparable to brands like Bower & Wilkins,  AKG and Harman Kardon, even with 16-bit music.It comes with a nice bag and a small cord adjuster.My Review:  Sound adapts to any genre and is really clear,  better than brands that people claim,  like Bose.Comfort:  No ear Pain so far,  Silicone is soft and doesn't have that &#34;stiff rubber feel&#34;.Bass:  Very Defined Surround feel,  Studio quality,  Perfect for listening to Orchestra Symphonies, Bass solos,  Rock and Pop.Mids:  PerfectHighs: Doesn't produce an annoying high sound,  good definition with Violin music and Pop.Sustain:  GreatVocals:  It's like the singer is singing beside you.Noise Isolation:  reduces around 70% in Noisy environments.has a minor hiss with some devices.Been using it for 1 Month.                    I have owned these headphones for a little over a week and they are great: sound is crisp, the bass is rich and vocals sound great, even at high volume. It comes with three sets of ear buds (small, medium and large), caring pouch and cable holder.  I listen to music on my Android Phone most of the time, but to really appreciate the true quality of the sound I'd recommend using an iPod,or any other "media dedicated" device.In my experience, with these kind of headphones, the ear buds you choose and how you put them in your ears make a huge difference in the quality of sound. I find myself listening to music for hours at a time without any discomfort in my ears.  The headphones are not noise cancelling, but they isolate very well the external noises at the right volume.  I want to point out the built of the product feels somewhat fragile so I would like to see how these headphones perform overtime.  They are very light and comfortable, but also the cable seems to be a little bit thin compared to some other headphones I've owned.  In my opinion, these headphones are worth the price and produce an excellent sound.                    I've owned $5 headphones and $100 headphones and these are worth just about the $15 I paid for them. Just keep in mind that they're $15 headphones and you'll be plenty satisfied.My praise for this set comes from it's design. Turning the drivers sideways allows for slightly deeper bass than other designs (although still on par with $15). I can never find headphones that fit in my ears but these will not budge even on a run (haven't tried under a helmet).The cord is my negative for this set, it's too long for PT use and the rubber used is not ideal for this application.                    I've been using this for about half a year.  I love how these headphones compare to the one I used to own don't break as easily for I am the type to throw my headphones in my bag even though they come with a little black pouch for you to store.  I find that their ear pieces don't fall off as easily as other headphones that I tried. Overall, I am happy with this product and am planning on buying another pair.                    The sound quality of the Sony MDR-EX210B/BLK Ear bud Style Headphones is great for the price.  The shape of these ear buds took a little to get use to but is comfortable to wear. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good sounding ear bud without empting the wallet.                    I was a bit skeptical about the sound quality of this item but that was all erased with the first use of this item. Bass is clear and virtually undistorted and highs are clear as well, and they are very comfortable to wear.
!###I am iphone earbud nut - have 6 pairs and this is by far the best bang for buck - Not static - rich full sound and 10 times better then anything outhere under 100 $$  A steal at 20 to 25$                    Definitely a fan of the sound quality, although compared to the Klipsch Pro-media earbuds I bought a couple years ago (on sale for $45), these don't come close. But hey, those are retail about $110, so won't judge too hard. The biggest downside is the cord. It feels like what you would find on a $10 cheapo set, but I paid $40 retail for these. I have pretty bad experiences with headphones, and a 90 day warranty with a poor-quality cord will probably result in a not so good situation. Will be returning them this week because of this. If you don't mind the low quality cable and are in it for the sound, I would recommend them. The bass is ridiculous! Mids and Trebles are sometimes washed out, but not too severely. sound-wise I would pay $30 for these. Cord-wise, maybe $20.                    A GREAT CHOICE for documentaries and audio books--I really like the slightly reduced treble/sibilance of these Sony earbuds.Very good value for the price.  They live up to the bass claims, maybe even a bit excessive bass response for all-around music use.I know I'll buy another pair when I lose or damage these.  And I will...                    as mentioned by the majority of other reviews, this set of headphones is a DEFINITE gold standard in terms of sound quality for the price. all you need to know is 5-24KHz freq range hits 98% of all audible nuances (and then some) that your music's dynamic range can muster out. make sure you load at least 192-320mbps mp3s/digital files and also adjust the eq function of your music device (a must for iOS products, iphones/ipods, who have the worst eq function of all digital players on the market).these buds really shine with sony digital walkmans like the EWZ-400 series (EWZ-475 sony digital walkman is my preferred mp3 device by default due to its extensive eq/sound tailorability specifically the heavy setting).there is a burn in period for the 13.5 mm drivers of these buds but it was substantially less for me than in some of the other reviews (give or take 2-3 wks of consistent use). the overall effect of the burn in was some extra clarity to the highs, bass on the other hand was fantastic right out of the box.;BLUF(bottom line up front)- avoid being shafted by the likes of Bose and Monster who tout $200+ for an impressive set of buds, learn the eq function of your player (would require some people to actually read the instruction handout of their purchase before using it), and get these. the buid quality is very good (7 out of 10) & not cheap feeling.UNADVERTISED HINT- if you want to hit even deeper bass notes than 5khz and your ears can tolerate the snugger fit, remove the medium buds that are installed on the drivers out of the box and put on the LARGE size ones. you'll open up a whole lower octave of bass.                    Fair warning: I am definitely not an audiophile, music expert, or anything.  I just like having music in my ears while I walk during the day (as a college student on a big campus, I walk a lot between classes), when I sit on the bus, whilst doing work in the library, etc.Context:Before these I had been using some $10 Phillips in-ear headphones I had bought from the drugstore, I knew they weren't great, but I dealt with them until they broke this summer.  After receiving some Bose over-the-ear headphones for Christmas last year, I became spoiled and had been lemming for some nicer in-ear headphones.  I started out on the smaller side of the price scale with these.  These Sony headphones were the best in-ear headphones I'd ever used until that point (and the most expensive, too).--The shortlist of ratings:SOUND: 5/5Sound was as good as I would have wanted, especially from headphones in this price range.  All of my music--indie, EDM, rap, bubblegum pop--sounded fine to me!  Bass was clearer than any of my cheaper earphones, and everything, all in all, felt clearer than what I had been accustomed to.  I'm sure other headphones might cancel more noise, but for what these are, I was totally happy.COMFORT/WEARABILITY: 4.5/5I have small ears or something, because I always have to use the smallest earbud.  With those, I could listen to music for a couple of hours with no discomfort.  I just feel like some (higher priced) headphones are actually more comfortable.  The other Sony headphones I purchased came with even more earbuds, but I have no complaints.  I didn't have much problem working out, but I didn't have a real chance to test it out, honestly.VALUE: 5/5Buying these was a great decision.  Losing them, not so much.  Came with:  3 different sized ear buds, the little thing that you could wrap the cord around (handy for people who like organized wires--can't wrap the whole cable around it but it's good enough I guess), and a felt bag.  So overall, great stuff at a great price.--Conclusion:I'm so sad I lost these so quickly, because I normally don't lose much.  I've already bought a new set of headphones (Sony-MDRXB60EX-GLD), which I've been using for a while, but I had a few issues adjusting to the extra bass initially (I like some bass but I'm not extremely hardcore, and a lot of my music doesn't utilize a ton of bass anyway).  These other ones are bulkier, which is also sometimes strange to me.I would consider repurchasing these Sony MDR-EX210B headphones again, if they're still available when I'm looking for in-ear headphones in the future.  Very much worth the value to someone who listens to a lot of music, but is not particular about all the ~fancy audio things.  However, I would also like to splurge on higher level ones at some point (just to check it out) so it will ultimately depend on budget whenever my current headphones break or disappear.                    I got these hoping a balanced, clear sound.  They fit the ear well and they feel good wearing them.  I find they are too boomy/bassy.  I ordered some less expensive Panasonic earphones at the same time and they actually have a more balanced tone, in my opinion. But I think I actually prefer a more open fit, like my sennheisser earbuds have.  If you like a real bassy club sound then you might love these.  My housemate thought it was a great sound.                    These earbuds are very better than I expected. They look cool, fits perfect and I am totally impressed with the Bass.I would definitely recommend this product.                    i love these ear buds so much i bought a backup pair.they can't be beat for the affordable price.they are comfortable and sound is great                    Just buy 'em. For what you're paying on Amazon, you're not finding better. These sound fantastic. Great separation of sound, clear through the entire range, and excellent vocals, both in music and podcasts.

!###Good sound for an inexpensive earbuds. Bought it for my daughter who always gets her earbud wires tangled and knotted. The cord separater helps, but still gets a little tangled.                    Great for the price! I bought these to listen to heart and lung sounds for PA school. The sound is crisp and clear, and the bass seems wonderful. Obviously I'm not a sound technician, but they work PERFECTLY for what I wanted them to do!                    They are pretty good, sound is decentSometimes the fall off but the reason is because when I wear them (the way i wear them) the cord is too small for my use.but it rarely happens. so I am happy with them.                    It is for my daughter, she loves it so much! she carries it whereever she goes. It is inexpensive and with good quarlity, best for a teen.                    These Headphones are great! I love the sound. They kinda look cheap. I just had really bad luck with these headphones, they last me 2 weeks. And it's not because they were defective, it was because my little nephew chewed the ear buds haha switched to bigger ones, and my dog chewed the cable :( I would definitely will buy again!                    Listening to music is personal choice , A lot depends on your age and how good your hearing is ,I think this a good product with good sound ,at a very good price ,You can spend ten times more for this kind of product ,with very little or no Better results  .  For the price I think it's good quality .And I like this prodct.                    I didn't really know what to expect from these headphones, but the sound quality ended up being better than my previous pair of Bose headphones that cost a lot more.  I was extremely impressed by this product.                    I bought these earphones after reading positive reviews on Amazon. These are a disappointment after coming from the Creative EP-630s. The earphones look flimsy and cheap and are nowhere near how the EP-630s sound.I also never could find the right fit among the 3 sizes of plugs.The mid size plugs were uncomfortable to wear and the large ones start to cause ear pain after an hour or so which never happened with the EP-630s.Typically, the mid size ones fit almost everyone universally.                    The sound quality is fine for the price, but the earbuds do not fit me correctly. They are uncomfortable and fall out. There are multiple size options for the pads but none of them solved my problem.                    Very good bass from this Sony Earbud. Much better than the standard iPhone earbud. The sound is very good for the price I paid and I am happy with this purchased. The only slight problem is that the Earbud tend to fall out of the ear with the slightest tug. Other than that I am satisfy with the purchased.
!###More like 3.25/5 stars.I bought these because I heard they were durable.  I guess I won't find out because my dumb-ass lost them yesterday.The bass was good, but it still lacked something.  I do listen to my music on a lossy format (MP3 320 mbps) and not a lossless format (like FLAC) and I have a good equalizer on my player, too (JetEffect 3.0 on the Cowon X7); but I know the quality of my music plays an important factor in the sound I hear.One more thing, try not to use the cord adjuster that it comes with.  I found myself pulling on the cord way too many times because of it.                    Comparing these to headphones twice the price (Woodees iESW101V) I preferred the sound that came from these. These are a great choice for someone who listens casually in moderate noise environments and doesn't want to spend a lot. They provide decent isolation and are fine for an hour-long listening session. They're a little bass-heavy, but not offensively so. My biggest complaint is that they don't stay in my ears particularly well, but at the price I paid, I don't expect them to do everything.Overall, I'd say these are not without their flaws, but they are great headphones in their price range.                    I usually create MP3's using VBR (LAME).  I use these headphone with my iPhone 4 (work) as well as my SanDisk Sansa MP3 player.  The sound is amazing.  I am hearing things I've never heard before.  These are a definite improvement over any stock headphones and I prefer them to the Sony MDR-EX56 headphones that they replaced as well as some Sennheiser CX300II that I tried but didn't prefer.  Everyone's taste varies, esp when it comes to headphones.  I can only say that I am very happy with this purchase and had I known my music could sound so good, I would have made the investment a while ago.                    Love these earbuds. Good quality. They drown out annoying outside noise. I definitely recommend them. I've tried many others and these are the best so far.                    These sound great, the bass is crisp and the mids/highs are clear.  I've been using these almost every day since I've received them for music and late night movies/gaming.  They block out noise a lot better than other earbuds I own.  ( had the wife nagging at me from across the room and I had no clue at all until she got mad and smacked me, lol)I haven't had any distortion or muffled tones, but I haven't cranked the volume to max, I'd be afraid of going def, these go plenty loud.                    the shipping was prompt and on time... very well made and great sound for the money; definitely recommend over the very cheap models with good low/mid/high's ... may fail against bose or other $100 pairs but for $30 they're great!                    I had been using this sony earbuds for a some time now and it really like the details in the sound and the deep bass!! I also compared it with the highly rated Klipsch Image S4. I can now say for sure and recommend this Sony earbuds over the Image s4 for the sound experience and the build quality is also much better. The Klipsch image S4 is really flimsy construction and it fell apart in just 3-4 months. The only small complain i have is the the fit . I just can't wear this earbud for a long time even though I really like the sound and the overall quality of music. It just gives you a whole new experience for the same old songs... just amazing sound!!                    These were purchased for my teenage son for Christmas.  He loves them, the sound quality and comfort.  He is a bass player and loves the bass sound he gets from these buds!                    Fit snugly in my ear, don't slip out.  Sound is perfectly balanced.  Amazing value for the price.  I highly recommend these.
!###I have had these ear buds for almost 3 months now and they are still working great.  Amazing sound, especially for only $20.  Some of the longest lasting ear buds I have ever used, especially since I use them non stop. Great buy.                    Normally I am incredibly hard on ear buds so I tend to buy the cheapest I can find and use them up and toss them with nary a qualm about doing so.  I used a cheap $10 pair of skullcandy ear buds for over a year before one side finally quit at the worst time so I was desperate for something right away.  Found these in a lightning deal and I must admit at around 20 bucks it was a little more than I was comfortable paying but the reviews swayed me and like I said, I was desperate.I didn't give them any break in time at all (I was desperate remember), yet I nearly wept at the thought of how I had used inferior cheap buds for so long.  These sound amazing!  They should not be even linked in the same class as other cheap ear buds.  The bass is excellent and the full range may not be amazing to an audiophile but for me I was stunned.  I heard nuances in my music that I had long forgotten.In addition to the sound quality the cord is long enough to stretch from a watch pocket while I work and not get bound up or pull the buds out of my ears.  The tips are different from what I am used to and quite comfortable and the little drawstring bag is a nice touch.  The L shaped connector is a bit awkward sometimes but seems to prevent a lot of the pulling stress and has prevented a few accidental disconnects that I have had with cheap buds in the past.Solid construction, amazing sound and, size variety in the tips make this an excellent pair of buds I hope will last a long time and I will never go back to those cheap flimsy things again.                    These pairs of headphones are not like any other headphones.  They sound like the more expensive ones yet are very cheap!! I was surprised by the clarity and the bass output on these tiny ones!! Definitely worth the money and More!!                    I hesitated buying these because of the odd shape but I like them more than my old Sony MDR 71's, Klipsch S4's.  Maybe not as clear as the Klipsch but fuller sound.                    I am very pleased with the audio quality. These are good enough to substitute for my excellent audio-technica monitors sometimes (I'd probably look like a dork sitting poolside with full size headphones on my head). I am very impressed. I think the isolation of the in-the-ear design allows these small drivers to reproduce a much more solid bass and midrange without the tinniness I have encountered in monitor headphones twice the price. The only downside is it might take a while to get used to the in-the-ear style compared to surround earphones or apple earbud style.  They feel like earplugs, but after a few hours of use, the have become very comfortable. I recommend these highly for portable use, they sound great and I have compared them to over-the-ear monitors costing 2x to 3x the price.  Also, a good step up in sound quality over the default apple buds, and I thought the apple buds were good enough for on the go, until I tried these.                    These replaced a pair of stock Sony ear buds. While they were pretty good, these sound even better, with more bass and volume. A really good bargain. According to the Sony website, they don't make these any more.                    The sound is great, however the cord is too long for what I am using them for.  I had to buy another pair, but I will use these headphones as a backup pair.  If you like long cords with your headphones then I would recommend this particular brand and model - if you don't then these are not the headphones for you.                    Good sound with my ipod through these. Main use is with running. I curl all earbuds over my ear from the back. This eliminates cord noise. Don't forget you have an EQ in your ipod to add or reduce bass, etc. I also have an earbud product with a &#34;J&#34; in it. I started with those and like them. I think they may stay in my ear a little better, but the sony's sound a little better in a side by side test, which helps when listening to MP3 quality. Sometimes I use them to listen to TV late at night by running a cord to the headphone jack of my stereo with TV audio input. It is much more comfortable than heavy over the ear headphones that squeeze your head. I have had no quality problems with either brand. I don't pull them out of my ear by the cord.                    Exactly what I needed! These headphones are such a bargain for the price. I'll definitely be buying another pair soon.                    these are awesome! Its better than listening through your car stereo. if feels like ur at a concert. thank you so much for the most terrific quality buds and the price is unmatched.!
!###These earbuds are better than the ones I got from Raidio Shack ($50). They bring movies and music alive! They have rich, deep sound and work great!!! Well worth the price.                    Great sound...excellent bass and clarity!  Just make sure that you adjust the size of the eadbud to get a good tight fit in your ear.  Some noise cancelling but doesn't feel like you're in a bubble, and completely isolated from the outside world.  The trick is to get the earbud far enough into your ear but not so that it causes discomfort.  Very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.  You will have to adjust them after a period of time, and they will slip out if not adjusted periodically.  I like the cord winder for working out so that you don't have too much of the cord hanging and getting in the way.  And for the price, I would recommend these to anyone that really enjoys listening to a lot of music that requires a good amount of extended-bass.  Just wish it came with a headphone extension cable like the higher priced models, but hey...for $25, you can't go wrong!  I plan to use these with my wireless monitoring system when I play with my band too!                    My son likes this headphone more than the one came with Samsung Galaxy III.  It seems like a good product.                    They sound great and they fit pretty good. Wires are a pain but the little clip helps. I would buy em' again.                    The buds fit perfectly and stays in place on my walks, and when I prefer &#34;alone time&#34;. Being able to answer my phone is a plus!                    These are good headphones for the price.  You do get a little more bass than other headphones I own.  I like the cord wrap and the colored ear buds so its easy to tell which is left and right.                    I think these Sony Earbuds are just great!  Great sound for the price.  They stay in place.  They are comfortable.  What more could anyone ask for.
!###I have tried countless iterations of ear-bud style headsets. It's always the same problem they refuse to stay in my left ear, and are always popping out. I have even tried other ear buds of similar design but suffer the same problem.  These surprisingly however stay in using the default adapter size. They are very comfortable when worn for a long period of time as well. In a five mile run I did not have to readjust them once.  Sound quality is amazing, with very deep bass response, but this does seem to sacrifice a bit of high end fidelity and can be corrected with tweaking the EQ settings on the device you are using. Sound isolation is very good with these, but just note that when walking you cannot hear cars coming up on you if you walk on the incorrect side of the road.  The only complaint with these so far is due to the sound isolation design, there is a lot of noise transmitted to your ears if you brush the wire. Other than that these headphones are amazing for the price.  Worth every penny.Pros:Secure fit and do not come lose.Amazing bass response.Comfortable.Reasonable cost.Cons:Treble is a tad weak for ear buds.Sound transfer via cable. (typical for this type of headset)                    The sound is excellent  and they are easy to handle and there are small ear pieces included. these are the best earbuds I've had so far!                    These are good, specially for the price.  They arrived in the right amount of time and were packaged well.  The sound is very clear for the price point.  I've never had earbuds with this thin of cord, and I can't comment on that part one way or the other.  Time will tell how those stand up.My only complaint/wish is for an XS earbud covering.  However, this is an issue I find with many earbuds.So, if you have average to large sized ear holes, these are great without breaking the bank.                    Really good for the price the only thing is it said that the blue earphones were discontinued so i don't get how they are still selling them                    These are the ones to get. I ordered these and the Panasonic RPHJE120K ear buds at the same time to compare. I've got about 10 pairs of various buds around my house and the only ones that sound even close to as good as these are my iphone buds.                    I bought these earbuds to replace my Sony mdr ex083's that I got with my Sony walkman. Prior to using those, I had just been buying the cheapy ones from Wal-mart or Target, so I was FLOORED with the quality. A year ago, I decided to look them up and I discovered how pricey they were, but for good reason. After three years, they broke so I needed replacements, but I wasn't willing to pay too much.I bought these expecting them to be of a lower quality than the other ones, but to what degree I wasn't sure. The first thing I noticed when I put them in was that they have VERY good, clear bass, and they don't really sacrifice the treble for it. They do sound slightly more muddled than the ex083's, but I expected that.In short, 5/5 because I got what I paid for, they are excellent, and are bound to surprise anyone who is switching from default earbuds. I am looking to get some even better ones later on, but these are sure to satisfy me for the next two or three years.                    So far so good with the Sony Earbud's...The sound quality is great, fits the ears comfortable, no distortion, lows and highs are clear&#8230;Would buy again&#8230;T                    Excellent sound quality for the money and a comfortable fit.  I thought these earphones were decent with the medium tips, but after I changed to the largest tips, resulting in a much better seal, The lower bass range appeared as if by magic and everything that I listened to came through very clearly.                    These little buds work better than the Sony MDR-1Rs which I am promptly returning after a whole 6 minutes of use. The bass is clean, the mids and highs are sharp, and you feel totally engulfed in the sound. When I have them on, I can't even hear anything else around me.Best $30 I've ever spent!!                    Great bass, tempos, sound quality and overall great for music on the go. For the price, these earphones have great sound canceling.
!###These probably will not be right for the &#34;bass-heads&#34; out there, but for me they work just fine.  Not as &#34;noise canceling&#34; as I would have hoped (my older Shure branded ones were much better), but not badI would have to say they are a decent value.                    I received these Sony earbuds quickly. They arrived in the original packaging, with two additional sizes of earbud covers and storage pouch. They sound great and I was pleased to find they block out outside noise fairly well, not totally noise-canceling but enough for what I use them for. Great item for the money!                    These headphones didn't necessarily blow my mind.  I have recently bought the Sony MDREX58V which are cheaper.  They sound just as good and I ended up returning the EX210B.  The bass is a little higher in the EX210b but it didn't sound very pure.                    Great price, amazing sound! Rather impressive Hz range and DB sensitivity, if you will. Highly recommended!!!! Last but certainly nit least, these are the most comfortable earbuds I've ever owned, hands down!!!! Nothing even close. Conservately, I have owned at least 9 pairs of earbuds. I work in the music industry, and play as well. You can NOT go wrong with these.                    These headphones have great sound, much better sound than the typical $20 earbuds purchased at a large big box retailer. They have a very defined bass and do not sound tinny (too much treble) like many cheaper earbuds. I would describe it as a very well rounded sound with crisp treble, solid midrange and solid bass. They have an odd shape but fit comfortably in my ears. My teenage daughter constantly steals my earbuds and is very hard on them. I was concerned about the thin cable but she has had these 6 weeks without any issue. She will ruin earbuds typically in 2 weeks.                    I would like to start off by saying that this is a great pair of headphones, I got them yesterday and have been listening to them nonstop.I listen primarily to the odd mix of big band jazz and dubstep/electro house, now these two genres are obviously very different but these buds handle them exceptionally well. The ability to produce the crisp trebles and midrange horn section of a big band while also giving a powerful bass sound out for drum kicks and the synthesizers common in electronic music is very impressive. My only small complaint about these headphones is that their large size makes them sevi-heavy(as headphones go) which occasionally causes them to fall out of my ear if I go over a bump riding my bike or something like that, other than that, great buds for a great price!                    Loving these headphones as i use it. Very good range of sound and also was looking for an L shaped plug which is also a plus.                    They are comfortable and sounds pretty good, the bass sound is good, the cable is of lower quality than the headphones but for $ 25.00. - definitely recommend them
!###These headphones have good sound when you put them in your ears, but getting them to stay there is nearly impossible. I got these because I wanted a pair of quality headphones to wear in the gym, but they literally fall out of my ears every 3 minutes making it almost impossible to appreciate the quality of the acoustics. I've tried all three sizes they give in the packaging and none have stayed in.                    Came on time and as advertised. Has 3 sizes of buds to fit your ears. Also has a nice wire holder to wrap the wire up that is extra when you are using it in mobile mode.                    I bought it for my mom for her mp3 player and she's pleased with it. Sound and length was both okey for daily use.                    I love these.  The sound quality is awesome, they come with various sized buds and a little bag to keep everything in.  Great quality and I recommend that you buy more than one whenever they are on sale.  These are awesome.                    Just got these headphones, they sound better than most expensive headphones and actually fit comfortably in the ear. These headphones are a steal, do yourself a favor and pick them up!                    I like that the bass is awesome. Cord looks a bit tin but no problems so far while working out at the gym.                    Delivery was excellentits comes in closed box, very nice.the headphones is excellent.The sound is excellent.But the cord is looks very cheap.                    These are great quality earphones. I would put them in a line up of ones that cost ~$50. The rubber bit that's used to organize the chord doesn't seem to be able to hold the entire chord wrapped up, but maybe I'm just wrapping it wrong.                    I couldn't get the earbuds of these headphones to fit snugly in either of my ears; they kept slipping out every few seconds.  I tried the replacement pair that came in the box but had the same problem.  I've never had this problem with other pairs of earbud-style headphones previously.  I think the problem is a combination of poor design and cheap materials.  Needless to say, I would not purchase these again at any price.                    These are the best sounding earbuds I've owned.  You would be hard pressed to find a better pair for a better price.
!###I owned a pair of Sony's MDR-EX300s for several years until one of the earpieces broke down - they were my daily beater pair, always wrapped up and in my pocket for years, so not a big surprise. I loved their sound quality and looked hard for a replacement.I subsequently purchased the Apple in-ear earphones, a pair of Earpods, and one of the Scosche models (115 I think). I actually like the sound of the Earpods the best (very balanced with good bass in my opinion), but wanted an in-ear model for the gym. The Sony MDR-EX210s fit the bill for that.The 210s have a much stronger bass compared to the older 300, and much much more than the Apple IEMs. The bass comes across as a little strong to me, but is perfect for workout music. It's a thumping and tight kind of bass. Given that the 210s are a third of the price of the 300s, I consider them a great deal.The only cons are that the 210s don't have a mic (I wish there was a reasonably priced model with a mic so I could use it with my phone), and the cord feels cheaper than the other earphones I own.For the price they are hard to beat.                    Not only do I have very little to nor trouble keeping them in my ear (as long as I cleaned my ears daily), they were super comfortable and would completely forget that they were even there sometimes. I'm not a big audio freak but I must say, for the price, the audio is pretty amazing!                    For inexpensive ear buds, these have good bass and fit well in my ears.  No complaints with these little guys.                    The sound is crisp and clear. I use these earphones for everything and they keep up with me. I had a few other competitor branded headphones of higher quality that did not last as long, so i highly recomend these.                    They came on time. They sound good, especially the bass. Like most reviewers, I found that the cable is thin. It doesn't affect the sound quality, but I'm not sure about the build quality. They still sound very good though and they are inexpensive.                    For the price, this is a great set of earbuds. The noise isolation is much better than the cheaper Sony MDREX10LP/BLK, and the bass is also quite booming. I've tried other brands before, including Phillips and SkullCandy, and their idea of bass is pretty pitiful compared to most Sony earbuds. That being said, I will see how long these MDR EX210B/BLU pair lasts me, as the longevity of earbuds does not typically surpass a year (at least for me!). Ultimately, I would compare the sound to these: http://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-XB40EX-Sensitivity-Driver-Earbuds/dp/B001RB24U0/ref=sr_1_94?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1366055359&sr=1-94&keywords=sony+earbuds+bass(Sony MDR-XB40EX High Sensitivity Driver Extra Bass EX Earbuds - 13.5mm) but these have been discontinued I believe, and the price of these EX210B's is quite sensible.Pros:Comfortable, secure fit in earsStrong bass and clear trebleCons:None so far                    Low price and high sound quality. But my ear is a little uncomfortable if I use it for a long time.                    Great deep base!!!  I love them they are comfortable and I wear this for long periods of time at work.  Sony has always made a great product and didn&#8217;t fall short on this one at all.                    Like the price and the fit. Has a bit more of outside noise than I am use to however very comfortable.                    I find that many kinds of earphones are uncomfortable and was very pleased with the feel of these.The sound quality is fabulous!
!###For the past three years I used an expensive set of Shure in-ear headphones (paid more than $200 for them at the time). Finally the cord failed close to the jack after intensive use for exercise and travel.  This is where most earphones tend to fail sooner or later, especially if they have a straight connection to the cable (not L-shaped).  So I was looking for a light new set with an L-shaped jack.  I was surprised to find many relatively cheap sets with good reviews.  Decided to give the Sony MDR-EX210B a try, since the price of around $20 allows you to try several others if needed without breaking the bank.  I did not need volume control or a mike in the cable.  They only add weight in the cable, which can be an issue when exercising.  I must say, after only two days of use I am very impressed.  The bass of these headphones (a weak point of the Shure set) is truly impressive.  Overall there is still a good balance between highs, mid and bass.  The bass however is almost comparable to traditional over-the-ear headphones.  It seems that the development of in-ear headphones has come a long way in recent years.  I have also used infrequently the Samsung headphone set that came with my Galaxy SIII about a year ago, but there is no comparison, the Sony headphones are much better.  I have used them for stretches of several hours and they remain very comfortable.  I use the largest earbuds as provided, also because they isolate very well and stay in my ear even when exercising for an hour or more.  My only concern is durability, since the cable seems very thin.  I will have to wait and see how long these will last with intensive use.  For now I am very happy with them.                    These are great little ear phones! The quality of the sound is excellent! Great product!!!I'm very pleased with this product!                    Good sound quality (for the price) only bad thing I can say is the earbuds are uncomfortable for long use.                    These are probably the best earphones I have ever had, even better than the armature set I got from Sony (except for the tangle free cord). Unfortunately I lost this set and they had gotten ran over by the time I got them back. I'll definitely be buying another pair soon though.                    Excellent ear buds with great sound for the price. Very good noise isolation when fitted in the ear canal.May get the same ear buds with a microphone to make it easier to use with my IPhone.                    Sony ear buds are the best for the price. Great fit, great sound and as always nice bass. Shipping was quick! Great experience.                    In a world of cheap, in-durable, lame earbuds and in-ear headphones, not all get the chance to stand out and allow them to take your money.This is a pair that may not make an audiophile grin ear-to-ear but it will satisfy the needs of a middle school or high school student needing a closed in boomin' listen.I bought these originally as throw-away headphones to use with my online courses in school, videos and more. I expected the bare minimum [sound quality wise] out of them. After receiving them in their exquisite Sony famous packaging, I popped them in with the default tips (also expecting the bare minimum out of these) and found they fit my big ears well! I was surprised any brand could make a tip that fit so perfectly in my complicated ears!I own Sony MDR XB500's, AKG 240k's, Koss PortaPro's and Klipsch Image S4's and I find myself using these the most. Are they better than all of those other buds/cans? Of course they don't compare, but the security, ease of use, and isolation brings me to pull them out first; they come at the most convenience.My only personal flaw: The cord, build and length. I like longer cords that give me a little &#34;wiggle room&#34; when using earbuds not to have them dismounted from my earlobes so quickly when I stand up or such. No complaining thereThe build is what you should expect out of $10 JVC buds at Walmart, thin, flimsy, noodly, and stringy. If the cord was a bit thicker, stiff and rough to the touch, that would make these feel a little more respectable and &#34;modern&#34; as they attempt to be.The build matches this. I know nothing of the durability because I've owned them for a few weeks but they haven't changed a bit.Side Note: I think the black color would look a little more masculine or modern, the blue is a little childish and less bold navy color, do not recommend the blue.Cheers on your purchase!                    Nice balanced sound, no static. Fits really well in ears.Bass not too impressive but alright. Would buy again if they broke.                    I'm no audiophile, but to me I found that these ear buds do a great job with all of the sounds in the music. Rock or classical the sound is clear and sharp. I do miss having a volume control on the ear bud cord but with this quality sound for the price I'll happily do without the extra volume control.                    I thought I was not gonna be satisfied with these headphones...  but after opening them and  trying them on I was very surprised how the sound is so clear the you can really hear the base and how it seals your ears from all the noise  and you listen to the music only  LOVE THIS PRODUCT
!###Nice ear phones for the price!  Very nice color and very comfortable on the ear, and the sounds is excellent!I would by any Sony Headphones!                    Based on the reviews I was really hoping these headphones would be all that and more. They are good headphones, but not any different sounding than the pair I bought from Walmart for 10.00. Especially compared to the Isport headphones that my husband got for Christmas.                    Sound quality is great with nice bass but the cord is really cheap.  The cord tangles easily and has memory of the last coil.  Not sure what Sony was thinking.  I expect the cord to fail within a year.                    I am accustom to better ear buds.  These buds are a joke.  The sound is muffled, but it does have bass - muffled sounding bass.  Do not waste your money.The build quality is terrible.  The cables are made of the cheapest materials.  Sony should be ashamed of producing this junk.  I would say these buds are worth about ten dollars.  These buds are alright for listening to audio books (speech), but not music.My Recommendation:If you are looking for pure sound reproduction checkout the line of ear buds made by Etymotic Research.  Even their cheapest buds have outstanding sound reproduction.                    I purchased these ear buds because the store did not have any Skullcandy ear buds in stock so, I thought I should give these a try. I am really impressed with the sound quality. I like to use ear buds when I workout. Once I started to sweat, I was disappointed with the feel. I noticed that the factory bud ends had a slippery feel to them, which causes me to frequently adjust them while exercising. This annoys me the most. If you want premium ear buds that will give you good sound and create a tight seal in your ear to block out the sweat while you workout, These are not the best choice.                    Has absolutely no bass, not even with bass boost switched on. In addition they won't stay in the ear. If there is any redeeming feature of these earphones I have no idea what it would be. Completely worthless, went straight to the trash can.                    i always by the cheap skullcandys but i decided to upgrade. but theses thing are junk unless you dont plan to use them in a gym/running                    The headphones work Fine, but I am recovering from a horrible delivery because it took two whole days from the day it was supposed to be delivered to receive my purchase. I live in an apartment so our mailboxes are very small wich means that the box that my headphones came in could not be fit into the mailbox by the mailman (usps) so instead of him (the mailman) taking my order back to the post office he decided to give it to the people at the rent office for me to pick up later which was a bad choice because these people are so unprofessional they open and close the rent office when they want . For now on I'll get the quickest shipping I can afford.
!###so nice to be able to use earbuds!  I normally have to get over the head headphones, due to not finding a good fit.                    These headphones are amazing and were also pretty cheap. They have good bass which is what I wanted and they have pretty good sound quality overall. These headphones are definitely worth it especially for the price.                    I have never really bought a good pair of earbuds before.  The difference in these and the cheap ones islike day and night. The sound and quality is so much better. Can really enjoy them on my riding lawn mower and bike.                    Just got 2 pairs delivered earlier today. I knew it is going to be a wonderful investment when I Amazon is giving it for 15 bucks so I ordered an extra.I am totally pleased with the class of sound these are capable of producing. I own an LCD2, AH-D600 and an RSA SR-71B, so I know what music should sound like, and believe me for 15 bucks, you can't beat these awesome earbuds. Go for it while you still can.                    I really liked these headphones when they were working. After about three months though, the right earbud stopped working. For eleven dollars, these were a great buy for me. Highly recommended.                    Considering the price, it is great! Bass is awesome, and if you listen to rap and such, like I do, then this is great. Highs might be a little tone downed, but for the price its great! I was worried it might look a little bulky, but that's not the case. And they are a great fit. L shaped plug is also great.Overall a great buy!                    I have an older pair of Sony earbuds (don't know the model) and they are probably 7 years old. I can remember the first time I put them in. I was completely blown away at the sound and the bass. I still do not understand how all the sound comes from the tiny hole in the unit. I decided I would upgrade. I did not know that some of these earbuds could go $300-$400 and up. I decided on the MDR-EX210 and I got them for what I thought was a great price. Again I am blown away by the sound and the bass. They are not a dramatic improvement from my old ones but well worth it for the price. They fit comfortably in the ear and I can wear them all day without any problems. Way to go Sony!                    I purchased these because they were at a great price and I needed a new pair of headphones. the sound is pretty good, but I am not too picky when it  comes to sound. they def. sound better than the other ones I have. The one thing I like about these is that they don't hurt my ear canal. I can leave them in for a long time with out them bothering my ears. also, they do not fall out. they also come with a bag to store them and a bunch of different sized ends. overall, I was satisfied with them.                    I am going to start off by saying that people expect way too much for the amount they pay. They pay $15-$20 and expect to have $300 sounding headphones HA!. let me begin by saying for the value this product is amazing. I did read the articles about the thin wire and it feeling "cheap", and I will say that it is a very thin cheap feeling wire HOWEVER this has been a PLUS for me because I have been able to workout with these headphones while I lift weights (bench press, rows ect) and I noticed that since the wire is thinner it sits against my chest easier, and it does NOT swing from side to side getting in my way. I LOVE THAT.I will also note that I have the Kilpsh s4 in ear headphones and these headphones are almost similar in sound quality (klipsh being a little bit better)HOWEVER if you have an android phone you can go to the app store and download a music player that has a equalizer, and this can make almost ANY HEADPHONES sound AMAZING (when you play around with it) I am currently using power amp from the app store its like $4These have been my favorite pair of headphones thus far because its great for me at the gym, whether i'm on the elliptical, or on the bike, it sits good and doesnt swing a ton, and it does not get in my way when I lift weights.It does come with extra ear buds and a cheap feeling small velvet bag case, however they protect the headphones great. I love these headphones and I would totally recommend getting them to anyone, using these with a music player app that has a equalizer will make them even more amazing. Give it a shot and see how you like it. I was skeptical at first but i'm happy I made the choice and got these = )                    Deep bass for in ear headphones. Cup style effectively mutes the sound of the subway - also great on airplanes. In fact, some might find that they mute surroundings a little too much for just walking around.
!###The price for these ear buds isn't bad but which is why I can't complain too much. I was just hoping the wire would be of better quality because the audio is already starting to cut in and out. If these stop working tomorrow, I would't be surprised or upset.                    I know that they snobby audiofiles think Sony isn't cool enough, but I bought a pair of the &#34;recommended&#34; ear buds from MEElectronics and rejected them after 10 seconds of use.  These Sony's sound awesome.                    It was a pretty good earphone right up until 11 months later, when one earphone went out, a month after that and it completely doesn't work. Lame.                    I bought those sony earbuds about a month ago, and they're just perfect. Great sound quallity and bass. And also really cheap.Totally recommended.                    I had one of those tangle free Sony ear buds. Lasted a few years and then went kaput. Decided to get cheaper ones. I like the sound that this one produces. I don't mind the form factor. The only thing that bothers me is that the thin cord tangles, but that's typical for this style headphones.                    Best sounding headphones you can get for anywhere near this price! I brought a $70 pair of Audio Technica headphones myself that I decided to return and these even sounded better! It also sounded better than my brother's $90 beats by dr dre.                    If the ear buds fit well, this set can reduce nearby noises. There can be some noticeable bass depth, but not always (not with voices).                    If you are looking for a new pair of headphones for either everyday wear or for working out these headphones are great. Very crisp sound, GREAT lows, and they are great at locking in the music you want to hear and blocking out the background noise you don't want to hear. I will update in the future if I encounter any problems!                    They fit comfortably. I now hear nuances of speech and music I was previously missing. Would recommend for others in search of an inexpensive pair of buds for everyday use (iPhone user).                    These are great. I've cycled through a lot of headphones, always looking for something with decent bass, good noise-canceling, and durability. I work at a job where focus is essential and I'm easily distracted, so I use these day in and out to listen to music and even sometimes without turning on my music to just help block out the noise. I feel like you absolutely can't do better for the price and honestly often double or triple this price fails in one of those categories. This is my second pair... not because the first stopped working, but because it occurred to me I should probably have a spare in case my initial pair got lost or damaged. Awesome product.
!###I love these earbuds incredibly so. I was devastated when I couldn't find them and then pulled them out of the dryer from being in my pant's pockets. What do you know, they still work! After being in the washer AND dryer, they work as good as they did day 1. I can't recommend these enough, I even bought them for $40 at Target and I still think they were underpriced. I'm a Sony earbud user for life now.                    A good product that works as good as Sony says. Always try to buy their products when possible. Yada Yada.                    I travel on business a lot and go through headphones and ear buds due to losing them or damage.  I bought these to replace the ones my dog chewed up.  These are great.  I use them on planes and they block other noices. I use them when I walk and they stay in the ear with no problems.  They provide good sound and are comfortable even to have in the ear to go to sleep.  I also bought these for my wife.  She wears them to work out and also loves the comfort and sound they produce.  I would definitely recommend buying these.                    Excellent sound, quality ear buds and deep base for the price. One can not go wrong with these ear buds for the price.                    Was disappointed w/ such fragile wires. they should be a bit "heavier"After trying all sorts if earbuds I've come to the conclusion that "Skull Candy" are the best for the price.Wouldn't recommend these or buy again.                    As soon as I open the package, plugged them in to my phone and blasted some music. You can truly feel a great difference if you have been using some cheap headphones before. Definitely a buy!                    I ordered these for a friend who was VERY particular about the sound of his earphones. Nothing he listened to seemed to compare to the Sony ex86 iems that were stolen from him. Until he listened to these, which he has owned for about 4 months now. Right out of the box the bass was too forward but it settled down the longer we listened to them. Sound presentation is like this: &#34;Sparkling&#34; highs, forward lows, and a slightly recessed mids. The only earphones I have in the price range to compare to these to are the Meelectronics M6, which is inferior in all aspects of sound. The sonys have a more tight, controlled lower frequency and less recessed mids which sound good with many genres of music. The only negative thing I have on this set is how thin the wires are (they feel sturdy enough though). They come with four sets of the Sony hybrid tips (not the noise isolations tips that have foam in them).I'm surprised these don't get any attention on sites like Head-fi, especially at their current price point. Highly recommended.                    These in ears actually outperform in ears that are 150$ (specifically the Sony XBA-3iP). The bass is really nice without becoming muddy.                    I sleep with these headphones in, and they're a lot more comfortable than others I've tried. Sound is a little better than average.                    great sounding, I mean it really sounds great for the price...I am sure Beats By Dr Dre may be better to pay $180 or more is not justifiable! I own other pairs and they're cheaper and greater than those, but these SONY do the job and more...
!###These headphones are amazing,Sony has done it again! they are really comfortable,I definitely recommend them to any type of user.                    They have good sound. They will fall out of ear easy. Did not hurt my ears,  comfortable for a long time.                    Very good product, the sound is excellent, but the cables seem a bit delicate for the material, but I had no problems.                    Granted I'm not an afficiondo and no expert, but after waiting for these to arrive *I'm deployed* I will say they are the best I've heard so far.  The price was excellent *$25-$28.00*, and the sound is REALY rich and full.  If you are deployed and are hesitant because you are worried about getting quality *like i was*.  You know you don't want to pay for something to find out it's only marginal or just meets your needs.  I will tell you that this product totally exceeded my expectations.                    These headphones are excellent. They are extremely comfortable, stay in your ear well, and have great audio quality. I would recommend this product for anyone who wants to buy an underpriced pair of headphones.                    They have really nice bass and sound but the wire is really thin so you should be careful how you use your headphones.                    The quality of sound of these headphones, I swear, are beyond what I expected. I personally can't believe people buy Beats headphones for $150&#62; when you can get such amazing, crystal clear with deep bass sound that RIVAL Beats quality on these headphones for this price! It's hard to find good headphones at stores, especially when they don't come with specs. I was looking for something that could deliver powerful sound, and this is totally what I was looking for. Couldn't be happier with them.                    These earbuds were AMAZING but only lasted about half of a year. The sound was clean and crisp and made me only want to listen to my music more. These are the best earbuds I have ever tried but they just didn't last as long as I expected for its price (and reviews). These are WONDERFUL but don't expect them to last longer than a year.                    Had to replace my Bose earphones when the wires all came apart. Bought these hoping they would sound just as good as Bose. Have to say, they give great sound to my Ipod and the buds are very comfortable. I would definitely recommend them. Can't beat the price.                    No doubt,The quality of sound is impressive!If  you don't have enough money,this is your choice,just belive me, no regret, worth the price.
!###Most of my earbuds last around one or two months, but these have lasted six and are still going strong. The sound quality is excellent for what they are, a good, reliable, cost-efficient pair of earbuds. I wouldn't hesitate to buy these. The structure doesn't look particularly durable but i've had no problems with durability over the six months i've had these. Couldn't be happier.                    Can't beat the online price and the sound is very good. They give a good range of sound through the highs and lows. Nice to have a choice of earpiece sizes, (s, m, l) for personal fit. I recommend them as very good all purpose in-ear phones.                    The Best earbuds without spending a fortune. You hear only the sound in you ear...just be sure to adjust the size of the earbud (referring to the three sets that come with it) After that it's crisp sound and thumping bass. Best of all they stay in while active: Jogging/Biking.                    Have not rcvd my order yet. But I had Sony earbuds before and after reading  the reviews I know they're going to be ok for me. But what I noticed here on Amazon they coat $10 less than the same earbuds that are black. So I went for the blue ones And saved $10. Go figure you pay extra $10 foe the black ones anyone else noticed this...BobbyG                    I just got these yesterday... They were being sold for $40 at some places, but I found them for $13 on here so I couldn't pass them up. I had been using JVC Marshmallows prior to this, but they quit working. These earbuds are much more comfortable and have much better sound quality than the Marshmallows. I use them with my Sony Walkman MP3 player and would recommend them to anyone looking for good sound at an affordable price.                    I received different set of ear buds as a Christmas gift last year.  They were higher end Logitech UE (Ultimate Ears), model 350vi. They were very nice, comfortable and pumped out great sound/bass.  Unfortunately, I recently had one of the UE ear buds slip off while riding my bike...and of course, the bud went right through the meat grinder of my gear sprocket.  I went on Amazon to look for an exact replacement of the damaged Logitech UE's, but was surprised at how expensive this gift was.  I then looked for an alternative at a more reasonable cost, and read reviews of these SONY's -- decided for the money, what do I have to lose?Well, while I'm not an audiophile with a finely tuned ear, I do have to say that the sound quality seems easily to be at least 85-90% as good as the Logictech, but at only about 1/4th of the cost!  As for the comfort, the ear bud is just as comfortable, and so far the silicone buds seem to stay on the ear bud better than the Logitech's did.  SONY supplied 3 sizes of silicone inserts, while the Logitech supplied 4 or 5 different sizes.My only wish for these SONY's is more substantial cords, as the cords on this SONY pair are very thin, and therefore can tangle easy if you ball them up to put in a pocket, purse, etc.  It does come with a small velvet drawstring bag that you can store them in, but most people can't be bothered with that level of discipline.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase, and will tell family members to ditch their old, hard, over-sized white iPod Apple earphones & replace them with these great SONY Buds.                    the headphones work good and look good but the headphone jack is at a 90 degree angle so it does not fit in your pocket well. I personally prefer the straight up ones but I settled. over all it is a good pair if head phones :)                    The quality is amazing for the price! I have gone through so many headphones, and I always come back to Sony. They're comfortable and the sound quality is great. You will not be disappointed!                    ok earbuds but bass is not stellar. I have an old pair of Panasonic buds that are falling apart but still sound better. Got these Panasonic at Fry's on sale for about $25 3-4 yrs ago...                    These are very good headphones rich bass and tones are very sharp. They hold in my ears very well while I work and they never fall out. Very comfortable can wear them all day no problems.
!###I purchased these after reading several reviews.  Very happy.  I use them mainly with my little SanDisk MP3 player, which allows the player to give me incredible sound enjoyment.  The earbud set enclosed with the SanDisk is just okay, until one experiences these.  The headphones arrive with a choice of three earbud cover sizes for maximum comfort.  The design allows for a good fit, which gives one more motion without them popping out.  For safety, use when not driving a vehicle, as well as when attention to one's surroundings is required.                    So far so good. I got these for my trip to Mexico. I usually get skull candy headphones, but they usually go bad in about 3-6 months. I've had these for a month now and I like the fit and design. Sound is pretty good for the price, better than the skull candy I normally get.                    im ordering another one for my brother. it was just as good as the $79 pair i had and more comfortable                    Came on time, original packaging, great fit, great bass, great sound for the money (15 bucks) if you are looking for great sound, in ear fit, grab these, one down size is the cord is a little on the thin size, but other than that, great deal                    These are the best ear buds I have ever used. I have gone through plenty of ear buds generally thinking they were good. Until I tried these then I was aware of what truly good ear buds are. Durability has been tested they are extremely durable, they survived 3day in the rain after a car wreck with no loss of sound or any noticeable damage.                    I love everything about these ear buds. The bass is true and hefty, which is marvelous. The quality of these headphones are great, considering I paid under $10 for them. I only have two small complaints. For as nice as Sony ear buds are (these are not my first), I was surprised at how cheap the cord felt. For the first time I felt like the cord would fall apart right out of the box. The good news, while these aren't the best quality Sony's  I have had in this price range, after a few weeks the cord felt less starchy and more like a regular cord should feel. One other small complaint: I am a runner, so it's important for me to include music during my excursions. With these ear buds, despite the different sized pieces, I can't get the ear buds to stay in my ear while running, and when they are in, you can clearly hear your footstep drop as a large thud in your ear. I have had ear buds in the past that never made a sound other than my music playing, so I know its possible to fix that issue. Other than that, I love the way they sound, crisp and deep. I have never had a pair of ear buds near this great for a price to modest. Good job Sony, 4/5.                    The ear bud has great sound.  Best one when you compare to all other budget one.  Sony still leading in this area.  The only complaint is the color looks not very fashion.  I should get a red or bright color one....                    These are the best headphones I've found for this price.  Great bass and clear mid-tones and treble.  Durable and easy to store without getting tangled.  Great product!                    Everything worked as advertised, but cord is a little shorter than expected or at least hoped for. Very good sound and fit tightly in ear.
!###of course shortly after buying these I found the Klipsch headphones I'd thought I'd lost. For the price these are very nice sounding headphones, not quite to the level of the $50 Klipsch but for $15 bucks they are a great deal.                    I'm no audiophile by any means but I really like the sound quality of these headphones, the design is a bit wierd but other than that, satisfied with my purchase.                    I bought this after reading several reviews and it was a good decision.  I found it clearer then several other brands that I own and some of them were priced higher.  I use these when I walk my dog so I can't provide much feedback, but I highly recommend them.                    Accidentally washed these AND THEY STILL WORK! They were in a pocket and discovered BEFORE putting them in the dryer. The sound is great, good bass. The plug is L-shaped which is great if your headphone jacket it at the top of your phone (mighty not work for you if the jack is at the bottom). Very happy with this purchase. Only $15...you just can't beat machine wash defying quality sound for that price.                    I have never been let down by sony.  Try these with a walkman and you wont be disappointed. For the price, it doesn't get much better than this.                    Just don't think too much, and sit back, enjoy the clear sound backed with heavy bass. At this price, nothing else match this awesome pair by Sony!                    They sound better than average.  Good highs, good Bass and fit really well.  The flat design makes it easy to adjust them to your ears.  Glad I bought them.  Plus, the thinner plastic surround of the mini jack material allows a good fit to my iPhone with the protective case installed.                    Great earphones for the price! Got them for my sister's birthday and they are amazing for how much they cost, and they actually do an alright job of cancelling out background noise. I highly recommend these headphones for anybody on a budget but want some quality sound. Shes now had them for 4 months and they are covered in her paint(Shes an artist)and it still works perfectly.***DO NOT GET SKULL CANDY EARPHONES AT THIS PRICE!***Mine broke within a few months.                    My teenage son loves these earbuds.  He said they sound very clear and slightly better than his Skullcandy.  I think he uses them too much.  Can't hear me when he's wearing these listening to his MP3, or maybe he just pretends not to hear me.Great value for price.  Especially when the blue cost less than the other colors, and blue was what we wanted.                    For $16, these headphones are wonderful. I use them in the gym with my ipod nano. The three different size earbuds were sized well and the large ones hold them in while running without discomfort. The bass is admirable. I have seen some headphones for less with better bass, but they have been uncomfortable, cheap quality or both. I've had these for a month and recommend them.
!###I like it.  It doesn't keep trying to fall out of my ear.  This is my third sets of earbuds I've bought.  The previous two had problems.  One - it didn't fit into my ear so it kept falling out and I had to keep adjusting it (very annoying and breaks focus).  Second - terrible drivers so the sound was horrible.  This - neither of those two problems.  I use it at work for 8-10 hours a day.  It does its job since I don't have to hear my loud coworker who sits 5 feet away from me.                    Of the 20+ earbud with mic that I've bought, this is the best in its class. Excellent sound. All parts work well. For me, the deal-maker is the right-angle connection to the iPhone. In all my searches, it seems that most earphone makers don't notice that straight-line connector to iPhone is bad design. The right angle works, makes sense for busy people who live the iPhone lifestyle. I wouldn't go anywhere without my beloved talk podcasts (NPR et al) AND receive all phone calls. I've done the research. This is the model that does it all.The only thing short of perfection is: I wish they would make it in flat-wire style, to lessen the tangle factor.                    Wow I bought these to replace my SoundSquared sport headphones. The wire is cheap looking but the quality of the sound will make you say whatever just like I did. I mean seriously if you have to have flashy wires get something else but the quality won't be a close to these. Save yourself the trouble and get these!                    first i'll let you know that i've never tried one of those $500+ ear buds. But having enough experience with regular ones, i can easily recommend these. to me bass is superb and highs are satisfactory.                    I have loved these since day one!Sound:The sound quality is great.  Strong presence of bass for ear buds (thanks to the large 13.5 mm drivers).  Great highs and wholesome mids.  I have used Apple, Bose, Klipsch, Sony, audio-technica, and many other headphones over the years.  The sound is crisp, full, and balanced.Comfort:These are very comfortable.  The first day I got them, I logged about 3 hours of almost continuous usage.  They come with 3 sets of ear bud pads (small, medium, large) to fit a wide range of ear sizes.  They are very light, do not apply excessive pressure, and fit snugly.Additional Features:These come with a little bag to keep them in.  This provides some level of organization and protection, as well as keeping dust out of the buds.  There is also a coil clip for wrapping excess cord.All-in-all, one would be hard pressed to find a superior ear-bud in sound quality, features, and build quality at this price range (and possibly double) from my experience.I have been a fan of Sony ear buds for years due to their quality and performance, and this set is my favorite by far!                    Beautiful sound, nice design as expected from  Sony MDR line. Only flaw is a weak cord. A braided cord would have been to much to ask for I guess.                    i bought these for a 10 hour plane ride to london and they did the trick. They are super loud, hit real nice..I love music of all kinds, from Michael Jackson to Metallica to Mac Miller  and everything in between.These work great for all types of music.These and a pair of bluetooth over-the-ear cheap headphones (Kinivo BTH240) beat out the ATH-M50's for me.Just i guess because of my lifestyle i was happier with this and a pair of bluetooth than a huge bulky set of headphones where i had to take of my phone case just to plug it in my phone.Bottom line: great earbuds for the price.                    I'm listening to music on these babies right now. Great quality. Beats my 'around the ear' incase headphones. They feel like I could wear them for a long time, and I have. They stick out a bit, but it doesn't matter, the music sounds way too good to care about people's pretentious judgements about my dance moves.                    I go through headphone earbuds like candy -- I lose them, they break. This pair has lasted for at least five months - and that's with me moving across the world twice. Sony delivers fantastic sound and the color is a sophisticated blue.                    These earbuds have great sound quality for a $20-$30 price tag!  They are comfortable enough to wear for several hours at a time (at the office, on plane, etc.).  They also do a pretty impressive job of blocking out background noise.  The travel pouch is a nice bonus.The only complaint I have about these earbuds is that the cord is really thin and feels kind of cheap.  My older pair of Sony earbuds that came with an MP3-player have much thicker rubber around the cords and feels sturdier.  I'm a little worried that these ones are going to get damaged.  I don't recommend getting these earbuds for use during exercise.
!###Before I go any further I must say that the real test of quality when it comes to something like earbud headphones is time.  If the buds don't last for very long, then don't bother with them.  A good example is every set of Skull Candy buds that I have ever owned (most of which broke down within six months, including one pair that stopped working after two weeks) compared to a cheap pair of semi-uncomfortable earbuds that I bought at a gas station (which to this day still work).  Skull Candy prided themselves on the quality of the sound they produced, which was indeed excellent, but having them break down so often completely outweighs any other advantage because you know it won't be long before you need to spend another $20-$40 for a new pair.  The earbuds I bought at the gas station can't be said to produce the best quality sound, but they did not produce poor quality, and they still work.  I could live with whatever foibles those headphones had, at least up until the time I decided to find something that would both have good sound and would not be uncomfortable.That said, that was why I chose Sony earbuds over any other brand.  This is my third set of Sony earbuds; the first was a small set that I got at Walmart for around 20 dollars, which lasted longer than any Skull Candy buds I had ever bought and produced sound of a comparable quality.  The next set was a neck-chain style of earbuds which I only stopped using because I lost one of the ear cushions in a minor accident; they were working perfectly until then and were the most comfortable I had ever owned because they were neck-chain style.  To clarify, a neck-chain style is one where the cord for the right bud is much longer than the one for the left ear; that lets you drape the cord around your neck, so that if you need to take out the buds for any reason you can leave them hanging over your shoulder as opposed to having to put them away to keep them from falling or damaged, etc.And truth be told, if I had been able to find neck-chain style earbuds I would have bought those.  I bought these because the product description said they would be neck-chain style.  The product description lied, and they turned out to be Y-cord.  But, that is the only problem I have had with these buds so far.  There was a minor issue at the beginning due to the size of the buds; when you put them in you can feel them hitting the side of the ear because they are so long.  But I could tell that they are designed like that so that they go straight into the ear.  That translates into better sound quality in exchange for something that is not so much uncomfortable as it is unusual.  And, being Sony buds, they continue to work up to the present time.The moral of the story, or morals really, are that Sony buds are a better value product (they last longer, and the sound quality is just as good as any other product) and that the cheapest was is not the best (these buds cost around $40, but you do actually get $40 quality).  So I would definitely buy these again, provided I could not find any neck-chain style cords first.                    I bought these to replace some beats that stopped working and these don't fall out of my ear while working out. I would highly recommend.  The bass is nice and not overwhelming.                    To be honest, I bought these headphones because they were so cheap ($14.95 for the blue pair).  I felt good about the purchase because of the favorable reviews.  However, you get what you pay for.  If I breath too deeply these fall out my ears.  I have tried all three sizes of buds, nothing works. Perhaps this is how buds work, but I will never buy buds again.  Not for me.The sound is alright, nothing special.  Again, for $15 what do you expect.  What I dislike most is the lack of bass.  The sound is clear, but not much else.                    sound is decent.  product says neck chain so i was expecting J cord, but it came with Y cord.  i want to return but threw away packaging                    I purchased this headset as a back up pair for my more expensive headset.  The sound and quality are good for the money.  They aren't the quality of my higher priced headphones but the sound is still good.                    These earbuds did not meet my expectations. They do not have a very full, rich sound and they lacked bass. Don't know where all the 5 star reviews come from. I have bought a number of earbuds based on reviews that just don't match my experience. I gave 3 stars because they were better than some I've purchased but I would not say I was satisfied with them.                    I purchased these headphones to use while running.  The sound is fine, but I cannot get them to stay in my ears while doing anything active.  This is the first set of earbuds that I've had this type of issue with.  I've tried changing the sizes of the earbuds, etc., but nothing seems to work.                    After a mere EIGHT attempts to find ears buds that would not fall out of my ears every time I turned my head, didn't make my ears ache after fifteen minutes of use and had great sound I was sure that they existed only in the land of Unicorns and Leprechauns. I don't know why I thought the ninth time would be a charm but it was! These buds stay put, don't hurt and sound fantastic. Now off to find that pot o' gold...                    The audio quality of the set of these that I received promptly, packaged nicely, is abysmal IMHO.There is virtually NO treble, and the response in voice ranges is very subdued. Lots of base, little else.The overall effect is muddy, underwaterish mush.I tried them on classical, country and jazz, and then gave up and switched to a set ofthe standard Apple earbuds that came with my new Classic iPod.The Apple product is a little better, but short of spending a lot more money in hopes of finding a propersound in the earbud class, I switched to my 10 year old, heavily used MDR V6 earphones.Unless you insist on a set of tiny in ear buds, and are able to try some before buying, I recommendbiting the bullet and finding a set of the MDR V6, over the ear phones. Yes, they cost a lot more.If you like HIFI sound matched to the quality you can get from iPODs or other portable sources, try the MDR V6.They collapse unto a very small cubic content, are equipped with a very generous length of heavy duty,coiled cord, and mine came with a very nice leather feel, pull cord carrying bag.The foam liner which bears on your ear is currently, readily available for replacement.My first liner set lasted about eight years of heavy use, including air travel, use on dvd players, computeraudio, and four different iPOD models.I need to set the volume level of my new Classic at about 80% level, whereasthe buds I tried are adequate in volume at about 50%.I suppose that indicates a somewhat higher battery drain, but the superb sound of the MDR V6 is worth it.Don't waste your money on these little buds. Get a real set of phones. Sennheiser also makes some very inexpensivephones that all provide much better, balanced audio than these little buds. Physics wins out.                    The wiring on these is really my only problem. They feel cheap, look cheap, and dangle around all over my body when I have them in. for $25 though it is a steal. The sound quality is very nice and crisp. I would highly reccomend these to anyone looking for a bargain.
!###It was a typical Summer day. As I finished stretching for my run, I grabbed my older Sony extra bass earbuds. A few minutes into the run, something unthinkable happened: sound stopped coming out of one of the earbuds. Thinking it was just my phone acting funny, I unplugged the headphones, and tried again. Unfortunately, nothing changed. Since my Sony extra bass earbuds had lasted for nearly three years with almost daily use, I assumed that the headphone jack was going out in my phone. Turns out, it was the headphones.I tried looking for my same pair of earbuds, but quickly realized they were discontinued, and the ones that were selling on Amazon were going for far more than what I originally paid. Since I had to run to the store anyway that day, I ended up just grabbing a pair of "lifetime warranty" earbuds for 10 bucks at Walmart. Let's just say I regretted that decision, and it wasn't three weeks until they met the same fate as my now deceased Sonys.At this point, I grabbed my credit card, hopped on Amazon, and found these newer generation extra bass earbuds from Sony. Same 13.5mm driver, just a different design. One month later, and they're everything I'd remembered. The sound is great, the bass is top notch, and I barely have to adjust them while working out. People often think extra bass earbuds are good for, well, just that, but these Sonys pick up all the subtle nuances as well.                    Bought two of these about 4 months ago, both have held up well so far.  I use them in my car and when sitting at work.  I'm pretty sure they will fall out of your ear if used during a work out.  Sound quality is good.  Bass is surprisingly good for a small pair of ear buds.                    It was finefor the first 20 days.Then the earphone intermittently malfunction. Sometimes there is no sound coming out.                    I had a prior pair of Sony IEM ("ROCKIN' LITTLE BUDS"! Wow, Sony marketing is pretty lame...) and really liked their sound.But eventually the cord fell apart near the bud on the old pair. In the interim, I tried another brand, but always liked the Sony sound signature and stage.These came highly recommended on some headphone review sites, and at around 20 bucks, why not?Really like the sound: good strong bass, but not thudding/distorted; midrange is clear and highs are also.  Feels like you're in the studio with the artist when using these - very immediate presentation of the music.What's also great about this pair is their noise cancelling ability -- put that down to a great seal when they are in the ear. I personally like the "disc" like design because I can hold that as I insert them into my ears for a good, snug fit.I've used these on plane rides and they REALLY work well - even though they are not active noise cancelling IEMs, they do a great job of blocking out the sound!My only complaint about these (and Sony IEMs in general) are the cords: they are cheap feeling and just do not last - this is the weak link in Sony's design -- and who knows, maybe that's Sony's plan so they'll sell more units.  The cord construction is just flimsy and if I get 2 years out of these, that will be enough for $20.                    I got them for $17 which you just can't complain about for these. Yeah, I'd be enraged if I paid that much for a pair of the old Apple ones but these have good enough sound quality and stay in my ears...well enough. I was a bit reluctant to get headphones (for running) that don't have the loop over your ear but these do just fine. Yeah, I occasionally have to push them back in but that happened with my old ones that did have the loop. Granted, maybe all I buy is crap. I was happy with the bass and the cord is a good length. Some might argue that it's too long for running but I like the extra slack so I can hold it in one hand without yanking them out of my ears.Just as a heads up, they're pretty much noise-producing ear plugs. You can't hear anything around you when these are in which is good in some scenarios and bad in others. Also, the cord does kind of make a lot of noise. But I don't own 60 pairs of headphones so I don't really know how that compares to others.                    Moderate use (two hours or so a day) -- as the title says, the left earbud died after 2 months                    For the prices I am very pleased with the quality. If I have to buy again will not hesitate.Appearance is good.                    I bought this item this March and when I received them they worked great but after 5 months of heavy usage the left headphone started to go bad, it still works only when I adjust the cable. I would recommend this product for those who use it lightly but for those who would use it every day hours at a time I would say to get a better pair, even if it costs you a little more money.                    Better than what i expected. It also came with a pouch which could help the earphone last longer. Sound quality was up to standard.                    Great price, super base, excellent fit. I recommend these for every use - in the gym, on the trail, working at home.
!###The bass is so loud. You cant hear the singing on a iphone. but its better on a computer.On a iphone 2 starsOn a computer 4 stars                    Lost the factory headphones and based on reviews, bought these.  So far everything sounds great, from les miserables to oingo boingo                    I was fortunate to find these on my Amazon Specials, so I was able to get them for 1/2 price.  Had I known how comfortable, and how incredible the sound is through them I would have been more than willing to pay full price for them.  These are by far the best earbuds I've ever had.Service was prompt, well packaged, arrived on time and in good order, what more could a person want?  :)I will certainly do business with this merchant again!                    I purchased the MDR-EX210B to replace the MDR-EX083 which came with my Walkman. There's no two ways about it, this earbud MORE than produced the sound you'd want them to do. You want bass? Look no further. Clarity of mid's and high's? This is certainly the earbud for you. The reason I gave them such a low score is for people like me who must walk or take public transportation everywhere, it is important the unit stays in your ear. The sound was so good I tried everything, but nothing worked. Maybe someday Sony will include an over-the-ear clip to hold them in place so I can give them 5 stars! Another help would be an anti-tangle cord. When time is of the essence to catch a bus, you haven't got time to fiddle around trying to untangle the cord for such extraordinary sound. What a waste. My friend bought these others instead. They seem to do the trick, so I'll try them next. My advice to you is to go with them the first time around Sony MDRXB60EX/GLD Extra Bass In Ear 13.5mm Driver Headphone, Gold.                    just unboxed and tried on three of my digital devices and without ANY burn-in time sounds fantastic! Well worth the $14 I paid!!! I will let you all know how they sound after I burn them in for 30hrs.  Wires could be a bit thicker, I've got an old pair of JLab J2's and they are the most substantial cables I've ever had on earbuds, none before and none since!. Nontheless these fit well and seem to be a great value.3/22/13 Update: I'm rocking out to Fleetwood Mac which has a very dynamic sound as I write this and all I can say is WOW, the crisp highs, snares and defined mids are outstanding, the spatial separation is accurate and the base is quick and tight but booming. These were available in both blue and black when I ordered but the blue were $15 and black almost $10 more [??] Since the color does not affect the spec's I opted to save the extra $. I noticed the price has jumped up a bit more since then. At a major retailer these are $39. Still wish the cables were thicker but I'm reaching to find any con's so far.                    I don't normally rate the products that I buy just because I am too lazy to do that. But this one product has made me put aside all the laziness just coz of the sheer quality of sound it generates. I am no expert but these headphones have just blown me away. Never bought any headphones like these and I don't think will ever for such low price. These are better than the brands priced way above $25. This is what I call "cheap n Best".                    I saw the reviews and expected a lot from this headphones. I will not say I was disappointed, but not too happy either. The sound quality is pretty good. Somehow I feel the wow factor missing. But for the cost its a good buy...                    i bought it at $15,and the sound quality is pretty good,the wires are goo as well.best headphone for the price.                    for the price they are great,  base is good, I usually get a few cheap ear bud for travel, I did not expect these to sound this good.                    Bought these to use for jogging, gym workouts, etc.They don't stay in the ears if you're moving around constantly.Aside from that, the sound quality isn't noticeably better than the $10 Panasonic ear buds or the $15 JVC marshmallow ear buds.Of the 3, the JVCs had the most defined bass sound, and the Panasonics had the most ringing, clear highs.These were in the middle on both counts.  The thin wires kind of irked me as well, as it seemed that they got tangled up easier than the thick JVC wires, and were more difficult to untangle.
!###I was looking for some decent earphones to wear for an extended period of time and not have to worry about loosing or breaking them since they would be cheap, I'm sure that for many people $16 is not a small fortune. So I started reading users reviews about most of the earphones here on amazon. I read reviews from the Shure SE530s which I also own and for earphones they do cost a small fortune, to the cheapest 3 dollars earphones you can buy also here on amazon. Then I felt curious about these sonys since they are so well reviewed and also they cost so little, so if I buy them and I loose them or break them, I won't be loosing almost $500 like in the Shure's case which I was always concerned about. Well I am glad a gave these a try. Boy these earphones can reproduce all very high & low frequencies like champs, their sound compares and can very easily compete with the Shures that cost $500 in both clarity and power, I love when you can crank up the volume and the speakers or the earphones won't distort the music. And these are the case, no distortion at all, and if you want powerful bass, even more than the shures can deliver, highs too, then you have a very cheap and simple solution. I can't be any happier with this purchase. so I recommend them as a very good solution and at a more than reasonable price.Unlike many reviewers, I'm not a sound "engineer or expert", but I do am a musician, percussionist, and I can tell the difference when headphones sound well and reproduce frequencies better than others. I'm very picky about sound and when I listen to music.After this purchase, I see no reason at all, to but headphones that cost even $20, unless they increase the price on these sonys of course.                    I got these in the mail couple days after I ordered.  Nice and speedyMain purpose was to replace my lost earbuds I had for working out at the gym.I used them for the first time at the gym and was pleasantlyl surprised.  They worked great!- The ear buds felt very snug and confortable in my ears. (almost forgot they were in there...and your ears dont hurt after long use)  They were snug enough to pretty much cancel out the noise in the gym.  My gym is pretty loud with the machines clinking away and they always blast loud music that I dont really care for.  My new earbuds helped almost cancel the backgroud noise completely.- Then I turned on my Ipod and the sound quality was quite impressive.  I could actually hear the bass which I never noticed on my old earbuds.  They sound was great for what the earbuds cost.  If you want really really good sound...you are bound to cough up $200 ~ $300 for a pair...and even then, I doubt they would be that good over these buds.  Might as well get the full earphones that wrap around your ear like the Boss.Anyhow, these earbuds are great and they serve thier purpose for me in the gym.  Not afraid to get them roughed up as the cost is pretty cheap to replace if I break them by mistake.I would recommend if you are looking for a comfortable, good quality earbuds.Cheers!                    Bought as a gift for my son as a Christmas present (2012)... and so far he has not complained... so that is a good thing. He researched and picked out this model of ear-buds, so it is what I ordered. So far so good!!!  The price was right and he is happy... so I am happy!!!                    These earbuds sound fantastic. Crystal clear across bass, mid-range and treble, with a very satisfying dose of bass. I usually listen to bass-heavy funk music, and these buds are very well suited to that genre, with clean, round bottom and punchy mid-lows. My prior favorites were VMODA bass freq's and Sony MDR-EX71's. While the bass freq's might have a bit more bottom, these 210's have much more clarity in the lows and mid-lows. You *feel* a bit more bottom with the bass freq's, but you *hear* more bottom with these Sonys. In side by side comparison, the bass freq's sound muddy as compared to these 210's. I no longer have the Sony 71's, but back when I had both the 71's and the bass freq's, I found the 71's put too much emphasis on the treble and not enough on the bass, so for daily use, I chose the bass freq's, Now I have 210's and bass freq's and the decision is easy; I will be exclusively using the Sony 210's. Example songs used for comparison between these 210's and the bass freqs: Marcus Miller Power Of Soul, Reddings The Awakening, George Clinton Atomic Dog, Graham Central Station Water & Hair, and Juvenile 4 Minutes. In all cases, the 210's sounded far better than the bass freqs. Highly recommended.More info: I've had the EX210's for 5 months now, and still recommend them just as highly. Today I got the Sony MDR-XB600 (full sized extended bass) headphones. I compared them to the EX210's using the same music as listed above. You can read my full comparison in the review for the XB600's, but here's the short version: The EX210's get 5 stars while the XB600's get 4 stars. Attached to my phone, the XB600's deliver only marginally better bass than the EX210's, and only deliver 2/3 of the volume. Attached to an amp, the XB600's are around 30% better than the XB210's as they deliver even more bottom than the EX210's, with similar overall clarity. Unless you catch a crazy good Amazon Lightning Deal (as I did), the XB600's cost 3 or 4 times as much as the EX210s, and are much less portable. Summary: The EX210's are a MUCH better value - actually the 210's are a SHOCKINGLY GREAT value!                    Bought this for my son and he uses it everyday and said it is the best he ever used and he loves it.                    Pros: Excellent noise cancelling, very comfortable to keep in ears for long periods.Cons: Too much packaging. Could be far less.                    I've tried just about all the decent budget iem's. This pair isn't half bad. The 3 stars id where they fall, average.A few years ago, this set would be among the finest offered for the price. Too manyoptions these days.The build could be better, nothing too bad. My biggest gripe is the thickness of notes. These sound very similar to the Skullcandy Ink'd 2. If you like heavy bass and recessed mids, these will suit you. Many people prefer that sound signature. No boosted treble, just boosted bass. The Skullcandy actually seem better build wise.Detail is barely average, but poor source material is slightly forgiven. If you're using low bit rate files, it won't really matter.  If you want great sound, I'd try to step into the 60 dollar range, where the laws of diminishing returns starts to kick in.                    If you are a fan of bass, these are great. They will thump your head like a boss. The small extension on the earbuds are the bass generator. These also make adjusting them to fit in your ear simple. These stay in your ear by the snug fit of the earbud in your ear canal. Thus, it is important to use the included earbud rubber fittings to create a snug fit in your ear. You may want to use a q-tip beforehand to prevent these from slipping out of your year. Once you fit these properly, these will fit snugly and comfortably in your ears for hours. I also purchases the cheaper Sony earbuds, and they rely on the curves of your ear to hold them in, and after a few hours, it can cause some discomfort. The fit on these is worth the extra $15 upgrade.I like to listen to a wide range of sounds, and I enjoyed the deep bass, and also high-end handling of these earbuds. For what you pay for these earbuds, you are getting a nice quality sound. My only con is that they still used the thin wires on these, which makes me fear getting them caught on anything.                    These are fantastic and a great value. I listen to music and audiobooks all the time while traveling and exercising. I'm not willing to pay a lot either. These sound great, feel great and even come with a cloth case. I couldn't have asked for more.                    Dead on arrival. Poor quality control. Little more to say, except that this desogn does extend quite a bit outside of your ear.
!###Love these headphones! Sony always seems to make some of the best affordable audio equipment that is comparable to gear that would costs twice as much from others; these headphones are no exception.                    Testing out these earbuds. I go through them pretty quick so the build quality is usually the only issue with Sony headphones and earbuds. So far the sound quality is as expected. Very rich bass and treble is good too. I almost find that there is too much bass but soon I'll get used to it. I don't have the sound up too much on my ZUNE HD to hear the music clearly. I do see that the wiring looks kinda flimsy and the connectors that lead into the earbuds themselves I worry about breaking. If you're rough with your earbuds like I am then this may turn out to be a breaking point. If not then they should last a year or longer. Sounds wonderful though!                    I bought these earphones seeking and expecting excellent quality. I chose Sony because I know them for their quality, and I wasn't disappointed. These earphones are worth the money I spent on it.The cables are long and sturdy - my PC requires audio outputs to be plugged into the rear port, and these are long enough to reach from back there (although I have my PC laid down on its side for better airflow). The sound is crisp and clear, and the bass is rich and full. From listening to Michael Jackson, to playing Skyrim, I'm getting great immersion.Sony products are often expensive, but they are often worth every cent.                    The Sony MDR-EX210BLK was a great purchase for the $28 that Amazon had it for. I compared it to my friend's in ear Beats (which was $130) and you had to do multiple comparisons to detect the difference! The sound quality is not only clean (and flat), but as loud as the beats! The cable is very thin, so it would not be practical for teens, and the noise canceling effect is good. Good value for money!                    Sound is okay. But it does not stay in my ears at all. I've tried all the sizes, and I haven't had this problem with other in-ear buds. Going to buy something more high quality.                    I am not particular about headphones and therefore don't look to pay much and find Sony is reliable. Sound quality on these is fine but the shape of the earbud is just bizarre. The round portion with the logo creates an odd fit. I do not recommend this style.                    I bought these to use when working out.  The product is a disappointment and waste of money.  The headphones feel comfortable enough, but the sound quality is zero.  The cord length is on the short side.  I should have known, as a general rule, you do get what you pay for.                    These are comparable to the cheap, low quality earbuds one could find at a local Walgreens. They have so much bass the sound is distorted, the wire is very thin gauge causing it to tangle easily and none of the silicone ear buds fit well and they need constant adjusting. Go with the Pioneer earbuds for a few more dollars. These are horrendous.                    Very satisfied with these headphones. The sound is rich, deep and clear for the price that I paid, I could not have asked for higher sound quality and higher build quality. I'm not sure how long they will last, but I don't use them every day, so I hope they last for years. I might lose them before they stop working. They come with a little tray attached to the cable which allows the unused length of the cable to be wrapped around it.                    So I have owned, and still do, headphones costing $400 or more. I decided to grab a pair of these phones for kicks, mainly to see how they sounded and to eventually give them away to a friend or relative who is trying to improve from stock iBuds or Earpods (the earpods sound decent enough, but I can't get them to fit my ears). So I plug them into my iPod Shuffle, not bad out of the box. Switch over to the Clip+ to see if I can EQ the highs a bit, and sure enough, a little tweaking brought out the treble, much crisper (I am not an EQ snob, I just listen and decide if I like the enhancement or not). I have to say, $16 for these IEMs is a fantastic deal for anyone looking for a great price to performance IEM and knows how to wear an in-ear phone. Some people posted that they fall out or there is no bass? That is a clear sign they are not inserting them properly to get a good seal. These are not buds, they do not rest in the ear canal. They need to be jammed in with the right size tip to get a seal. Otherwise, no matter what phone you buy that is not over the ear, you will not get the sound they were meant to produce.I can only say with 20 minutes of listening (have the Underture from Tommy playing right now), these phones are an excellent value purchase. And I don't mean they sound okay for the money. For $16, they are competitive with phones costing $100 in my view. I have been down the buying and trying road for a long time, a decade, and frankly I am starting to believe that the low budget IEMs out there, including this one, are starting to offer the best value. No, they are not my $400 customs, which do indeed deliver a richer, more dymamic sound. But $16 vs. $400? Owning those expensive phones is nice, but if I had to go back to my under $60 collection (this phone, Sony MH1C, Apple ADDIEM), I would not be terribly upset.Highly recommended as a workout, walkabout phone. And perfect for kids, since you can buy 3-4 pair and keep them for the inevitable loss/destruction. However, to reach their potential, EQ is necessary.
!###Not comfortable to ears .. The logo is fading out and wires are always tangling together . Won't recommend .                    Really good base to them if you know how to set your settings and sound great, I would recommend these if you like music with a better sound then most head phones ive heard. Sound better then beats but not as good of a base as them                    I purchased the Sony MDREX86LP/BLK Earbud Style Headphones back in February 2012 from another seller, and I was fairly satisfied with the quality for about the same price.  When it finally came time to replace them (about a month ago), amazon.com suggested this model, Sony MDR-EX210B/BLK, claiming that this version is the latest model of the MDR-EX86LP/BLK.  So I gave it a try.  I think the (bass) sound is really great for the price, but I'm unsatisfied with the quality (thinness) of the wires used.  The wires on the MDR-EX86LP/BLK (or at least the plastic wire wrapping) is at least 2x the diameter of the light-grey plastic covered MDR-EX210B/BLK wires.  As for being the &#34;latest model&#34; of previous earbud headphones that I had purchased, it seems more like a cut back or regression in quality from Sony.  They sound great now; but with normal wear, I'm just wondering how long these wire cords are going to last.The seller was prompt to process and deliver my order, and the product was packaged exactly as you might find at a retail store.  The product critique (and thus the product rating) does not reflect the quality of sales service that I feel I have received from the seller (Thank you, DBROTH).                    These earbuds are the worst design I have ever tried. The cords are so long that they catch on everything and the earbuds themselves are so heavy that their weight pulls them out of the ears when you move. I tried all the adapters that came with the earbuds hoping to find one that would help hold the buds in the ears with no luck.I was using these with my IPod when exercising but gave up and went back to the old original buds that came with the player.                    These headphones sound great for the money. Very satisfied. I would reccomend to anyone who wants a good pair of everyday headphones                    Great set of headphones, Beats by Dr. Dre that cost 6 to 7 times more & don't sound as good as these. True stereo sound                    For the price excellent soundinding ear plugs  no complaints fit nice in the earAnd I like the red for right ear and  regular for left iphone plugs are whack                    I bought this earbuds six month ago and I didn't regred, it sound amazing and support sweat and last more than the others one                    I am very pleased and surprised by the performance and sound quality of this headphones. I did not have the best of experiences with Sony's headphones from a durability standpoint. The phone jacks get loose with repeated use on iPods and one of the speakers goes out after a short while every time. So, I was hesitant to try another one after going through a half dozen different models in the past couple of years.These new pair sound rich and full. Bass is deep and full range clarity of sound rivals my much more expensive Kilpsch Image S4i headphones. Just wish the cords were flat, tangle free kind so overall quality of construction would match that of its sound. But at this price range, there is not much to complain since I can buy 3 of these for a price of a Klipsch S4i. Greatly Recommended.                    These earbuds are comfortable and cancel out most outside noises, even when you don't have music playing.  They sound pretty good, too.  Best of all, I accidentally washed them in my clothes and they survived!
